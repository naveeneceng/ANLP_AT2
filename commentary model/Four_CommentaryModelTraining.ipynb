            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball again but {{BATSMAN}} has second guessed {{BOWLER}} there. Waited deep inside the crease and pounced on the width to flay it behind backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 148.2km/h of wasted energy as he dishes out a half-volley on the pads, and {{BATSMAN}} gets a tasty starter, flicks it off his pads towards the backward square leg fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and cuts it to the right of cover for a four. Excellent timing and placement!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is ridiculous from {{BOWLER}}. The slower bouncer, well wide of off and third man was inside the ring. Too easy for {{BATSMAN}}, just waited and dinked it effortlessly over the fielder at 45. Big over for {{TEAM}}, 19 coming off it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow, Bhuvi under pressure straight away! Is {{BATSMAN}} the new Jayasuriya? A back of a length delivery drifting into the pads, a slog across the line, and a thick inside edge to backward square leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, kneels down and slog sweeps it behind square for a four! That was spilling down and has been helped on its way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets into a picturesque position as he loft-drives {{BOWLER}} over extra cover. On one knee mind you, sweetly timed and in the gap as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bangs it in short without any venom behind it. {{BATSMAN}} gets into a good position and pulls it behind square on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finds the fence! Much-nee{{BATSMAN}}d one for {{TEAM}} to break the shackles. {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act. Used his feet to get to the pitch and what he did well was to go straight down the ground. Cannot afford to play across the line on this pitch and he does the smart thing. Hit it {{BATSMAN}}ad straight and Shardul from long-on did try to get to the ball but eventually missed it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, punishes the short ball and pulls hard through square leg. Motoring along is {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} throws it wide outside off. {{BATSMAN}} keeps his front leg out of the equation and drives to the deep cover fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length, cutting away across off. There should've been no room for {{BATSMAN}} here, but he's manufactured it for himself by stepping away. But even from his modified position, the width isn't quite there to free the arms. Still, he's able to scythe this through baclward point. Beats third man's diving effort\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant hand-eye co-ordination. {{BOWLER}} continues to bowl short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} set himself up early on this occasion, raced away off the sweet spot behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} at his sublime best! Not all that full but a hint of width and he trusts the surface by driving on the up. Relied on timing and placed it through the crowded off-side cordon. Raced away past point in a flash\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drags it down, and fittingly as KKR's campaign has gone in 2019, {{BOWLER}} too bowls out with a long hop. {{BATSMAN}} goes back in, makes it look a lot worse and pummels it wide of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 137ks and on a back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} looked a little cramped for the glide to third man and squeezed it out off the splice. Wide of the lone slipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that ball had no right to go to the fence. It was just touched by {{BATSMAN}} on the whip but the timing was extraordinary and it raced off his blade. It beats the man at mid-on and canters to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant back-cut. As late as possible. {{BATSMAN}} cutting the ball behind him and the pace on the ball beats the chasing and diving McClenaghan. Top shot that one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and cheeky! Waits on it and opens the face of the blade to glide it away to deep third man for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's dropped a touch short, so even though it's turning the ball's hittable. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and slaps that disparagingly wide of mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped. {{BATSMAN}} tries a cross-batted whack, but the ball sticks in, just doesn't come on. And Vijay - the mid-on guy - is a touch late in reacting, but does decently towards the end to stretch out, only for the ball to burst through the palms\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this pitch is a belter, 180 is a must. Half-volley outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and slams it straight of mid-off who dives in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and slices that away to square third man for four, and that's the second time {{BOWLER}} has conceded more than 28 in an over in this IPL. Surreal hitting...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh no! Rahul has let one go right through his legs. Drifting on the legs and {{BATSMAN}} whips it powerfully to wide long-on, Rahul gets there but allows it to escape past him. That should get {{BATSMAN}} going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, high full toss - just below waist - and sliding down leg. {{BATSMAN}} helps it on its way to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gentle loosener from {{BOWLER}}, short and on {{BATSMAN}}'s hips, he swivels across, uses the pace on the ball and helps it behind square on the on-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower, much slower short ball. {{BATSMAN}} has all the time in the world to place the pull behind square on the on-side to tease the man from deep square to give it a valiant chase\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, the shots are coming off today for the Royals, friendly length ball wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} drives it on the up and over cover - no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, short and wide from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't need a second invitation, hangs back and cuts it square on the off-side, beats the fielder in the deep with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, reverse swept! Shortish delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} does well to reverse sweep that over short third man, gets four more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, uppish but just through the gap! Was a 'hit me' ball from {{BOWLER}}, shortish with width on it but {{BATSMAN}} didn't want to keep the cut down. Not a wise thing on this pitch but he got it in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, looks to slog sweep, the ball chalks the outer thin edge and runs past the keeper for a four. Lucky and streaky\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and angled in, {{BATSMAN}} stays leg-side of the delivery and biffs it straight, long-on and long-off can't cut it off. Too good\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is a horrible delivery from {{BOWLER}}. Tried the slower short of length delivery, sat up nicely in the surface, {{BATSMAN}} had all the time to pick his spot and he muscled it over mid-wicket, for a one bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track, gets to the ball on the half-volley and lifts it back over the bowler's head, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss and slapped over cover for a four. Few bounces and into the fence. Stayed steady and slammed it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, neat hit that to this short of length delivery. Wristed that behind square at the last minute to pick up the backward square leg gap. No chance for the man at fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Cummins makes a mess of a simple stop and concedes a boundary. On a good length and holding its line outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went for the big drive, gets a thick edge over backward point. Cummins did all the running, slid and stopped the ball, but it hit his legs and rolled onto the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no fuss. {{BOWLER}} overcompensates with one that's short, into the body and gets swiped into deep mid-wicket. Again, no fuss, not even a celebration. Typical dad stuff, you're never happy, and that's exactly what this {{TEAM}} are\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets way with another slice of luck. He came down the track, set himself up for the lap sweep, {{BOWLER}} spotted it and went wider, finds the outside edge and it loops past Pant. Can't do much as a bowler in this format of the game\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the line is wrong and {{BATSMAN}} is single-handedly threatening CSK here. Slower delivery down the leg-side, can't bowl there with fine leg inside the ring and {{BATSMAN}} helps it away on his way over the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a wasted delivery. Well down leg and all {{BATSMAN}} has to do with these is get some wood. And he gets a whole chunk on it. Flicks it away off his pads\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} twitches his back knee and throws the kitchen sink, a big-blooded edge flies away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} latches onto it. The Mumbaikar hangs back and cuts it fiercely to the left of a diving backward point fielder. The ball raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and flies over first slip. {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink - comes down the track, gets an outside edge and fortunately for him, it loops over a leaping first slip fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, enough of dots, {{BATSMAN}} wants to get on with the game! Gets a full legbreak on off, with a high back lift and thumping wrists he powers it down the ground for a blazing boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} shows how to tackle the inswinger from {{BOWLER}}. Steps down and clips with the swing to bisect the field between mid-on and mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shortish outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, and it's been slapped to the point boundary. What's Man{{BATSMAN}}ep done to himself here? He charged across from sweeper cover and put in the dive. Valiant but futile effort. Looks in some pain. He's fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slashes at that, the ball creams the outer part of the bat and goes between short third man and backward point for a four. It was full and well outside off. The bait was there and {{BATSMAN}} didn't back off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is not happy with the effort from Suryakumar Yadav. Was a tough one, but chance nonetheless! No feet from AB, just swats the pull from the crease and it went flat to the right of wi{{BATSMAN}} long-on, SKY did well to anticipate it but in the end he went for the dive and lost track of the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just over Morris. Lands the wrong 'un outside leg, {{BATSMAN}} is down on his knee to play the sweep, waits for the ball to turn across and helps it over a leaping Morris\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, spots the googly out of the hand and lofts it over mid-off. The line was a bit too wide of off which was a giveaway too. A good forward stride from {{BATSMAN}} before hitting through the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundary to start proceedings in the final phase of the match. Positive intent by {{BATSMAN}}. Eyes the deep square leg fence and drags the short ball away nicely. The fielder inside the circle was a touch too square and the fielder in the deep was very fine, right into the gap and that shall be four runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, premeditation from {{BATSMAN}}. Walked across his stumps even before {{BOWLER}} bowled the ball, it was outside off and he still managed to lap it over short fine. Umesh gives chase and can only escort it to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's as Caribbean as anything. Clears the left-leg and slaps this length ball over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hundred for {{BATSMAN}}. Fine innings from the Kings XI skipper. He has led from the front and has put his team ahead in this tie. Takes off his helmet and soaks in the applause from his team mates and owners. And does the \"I don't hear anything\" celebration that he does. Full delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink and the outside edge flies over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor from {{BOWLER}}. He strays in line again. That's not what Pune want at this stage as they strive to crank up the pressure. {{BATSMAN}} picks it off his hips and glances it past short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, played, well played DK! This was a flighted delivery and {{BATSMAN}} played with an angled bat to pierce the gap on the off-side. Gets it past short third man and the timing was such that it races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pulls out some deft dabs from his bag of tricks. {{BOWLER}} keeps going through with full-paced seam ups .. {{BATSMAN}}'s waiting, showing it the opened up face and dabbing it just wide of Buttler's dive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a freebie from {{BOWLER}}! A low full toss at 139.7kph on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it fine and the ball reaches the fence in a jiffy. The boundary brings up AB's fifty!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ruins the over. But it was a top shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Speared into the blockhole and {{BATSMAN}} almost casually squeezes the slice past the diving point fielder, the lightning fast outfield takes care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Mighty fine innings from the youngster. But with three overs to go he needs to keep going. Short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} was early into his swivel-pull, off the toe-end and past the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the swipe that Delhi batsmen have been attempting to no avail. But this time he has got a bit of bat on it. The delivery was slower than usual, might have helped his cause. Hits over mid-wicket and fetches a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss, straight at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} lifts it barrel straight, no-one's stopping that!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now deft touch from {{BATSMAN}}, oh that's beaten third man near the fence. Faf was shouting run, run, run.. to {{BATSMAN}}, who was so confident and just jogging. He was right. Third man was wide and he couldn't cut it off. That's one problem of having pace up your sleeve, batsman sometimes use it to their advantage\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's it. Lays into a half volley, screeching it through the covers, beating the leather off it. And {{TEAM}} begin their move up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery, too much time for {{BATSMAN}} on the back foot. Was short and he pummelled the pull between deep square and deep mid. Perfect placement\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, the non-turner outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for a premeditated sweep shot and the ball scoots under his blade. Kept low too and hence the keeper couldn't stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mistimed, but worth it. He saw there was no-one at deep mid-wicket, takes on the short ball and despite the ball getting big on him, he pulls full-throttle. Excellent batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, {{BATSMAN}} is sweeping {{BOWLER}} into frustration, this was very full and well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} bent down low and then swept it in front of square on the on-side. Lynn was very square on the on-side and even a big dive can't help him pull the ball back into play\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, successive boundaries! Goes straight this time, smacks the tossed up delivery hard and beats the fielder at long-on this time around\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR. Deft. Uses the crease to make subtle adjustments and glides a slider with a silk touch down to third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, consecutive fours for the skipper and this one is more classic. Goes back to this ball and tucks it fine after a hop in the crease. The ball races to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is one ground that he can make it big if he gets his eye in. The boundaries are short and even mishits can go all the way. {{BOWLER}} bowled a fuller length and just outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} lofted it over cover, didn't come from the middle of the bat, but good enough for a one-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball outside off, a cardinal sin in T20, {{BATSMAN}} opens up his stance, clears his front leg, and carts it away cross-battedly to long-on for four. {{TEAM}} bowlers under fire, and {{BATSMAN}}'s epiphany continues...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top-edge and four, no control over this pull from {{BATSMAN}}, but he got enough bat to clear Saha and his gloves, banged in short and well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} was clearly late on the shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh what a shot! Leans forward and plays that drive with an angled bat to get it past backward point, timing very good and it runs away for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a gift first up from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} gleefully accepts it. A wide, half-volley outside off at 139.9kph, {{BATSMAN}} throws his arms and flays the drive through the covers. Sped away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the carnage continues! And to be honest, {{BOWLER}} isn't helping his cause either by going shorter. It was pacy but {{BATSMAN}} got hold of the pull, and belted it wide of mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nowhere near the middle of the bat, but {{BATSMAN}} won't mind a bit. {{BATSMAN}} backs away and wanted to loft it inside-out over covers. Since the ball was a slower one, he ends up slicing it over covers. The quick outfield does the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very smart from {{BATSMAN}}. Knew there was no fine leg; plants his front leg across and rolls his wrists on the sweep. Sends it very fine and earns himself a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, this is some supreme batting from the two Daredevils openers. Cross seasm delivery from {{BOWLER}}, but it's short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it and cuts it behind square on the off-side, beats the inner ring and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, much needed for the Royals, dropped short and spinning back into the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} waited on it and then cut it late - beat backward point and raced away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, everything going GL's way. A genuine outside edge and it has flown to the third man fence. Flashed at a length delivery outside off and got a thick edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh almost chopped on and what a good first ball that was {{BOWLER}} the young {{BOWLER}}. Pacy, good length, seam pretty straight and just tailing back in and it seriously tests {{BATSMAN}}. He wanted to go for the drive, the feet weren't fully forward, lucky that the edge escaped past the off stick. Troubled by the movement in to him on that occasion\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's read this slower ball! gosh he has. Slow and short, {{BATSMAN}} stays on the front foot as he mauls this over deep mid-wicket. Raises his bat to a fifty but we are left wanting for the pat-thigh-Mo'-twirl celebration\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is such a fantastic shot. He was beaten in length after stepping out, as {{BOWLER}} pulled it well back. But {{BATSMAN}} remains undeterred, going through with the cover drive and creaming it to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, magnificent shot to start the over! {{BOWLER}} serves width outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and biffs the drive over Karun Nair at extra cover. Once it cleared him, there was none stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the boundary releases all the pressure {{BOWLER}} built up. Poor bit of work from Anukul Roy. It was on the shorter side and {{BATSMAN}} pulled it to deep square leg, Roy was late to spot the ball and by the time he did and put in the dive, it was too late\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, utter disdain. Take that .. width, pace and it is back in that point zone. Thumped hard. How things turn\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} knows Iyer is biding his time, so he has to attack. Spots an overpitched delivery outside off, transfers his weight quickly forward and bashes it past cover. It was on the rise but just wide of the fielder and off it trickles away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} goes full this time. Tossed up delivery around middle, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and smacks this one over mid-on. The fielder there tried all that he could with a leap but the ball eluded him with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a magnificent shot against the turn. But because it was so full, he really didn't have to worry about it. Drifting in on middle, {{BATSMAN}} whips it away over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, a rare botch-up from Bairstow tonight - he has missed a simple stumping chance. {{BATSMAN}} rushed down the track, swung in hope against the ball kept slanting in, past the inside edge and past the gloves of the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slapped! A short of length delivery outside off at 138.1kph, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and muscles the cross-batted shot through the covers. Not a muscle moved. Stand and deliver\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just needed one delivery to get his timing right and it's pure class flowing from the bat of Kane {{BATSMAN}}! Gets into superb position as he jumps on this full ball and creams the drive sweetly past the diving left hand of cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, on a good length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward on the drive, seemed to have checked his shot at the lst moment. It went in the air and past {{BOWLER}}, beat mid-off's sprawling dive to his right and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a really good shot. It's inside-out but it's off the back foot which is not easy to do at all. Flat from {{BOWLER}} and sliding in, {{BATSMAN}} stays in the crease and somehow finds the power to lift it over extra-cover and take it to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more of the same. The ploy here from {{BOWLER}} refuses to change and {{BATSMAN}} too refuses to stand up on his feet against this length. Does all he can to get under the ball and keeps his bat on the scoop. This time right over the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length del - doesn't matter - {{BATSMAN}} gets on his knee, bows his head down, and absolutely nails the scoop over the gaping 'keeper to the long stop fence for a one-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, who would want to be a bowler in this format? Dropped catch just on the previous ball and this one has been belted away. Full in length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} advances down the wicket and smokes it over cover for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sitter googly. {{BATSMAN}} sits over it, no sorry stands over it, and slaps it away hard, and doesn't even bother keeping it down as he goes over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the sweet sweeps. More of them. Gets one right in the slot and the premeditation does the rest. Brooms it in front of square..and well past the hopes of those perched out there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a hat-trick of boundaries. Spears a full ball down the leg side and {{BATSMAN}} has glanced it away to the fine leg fence. Just had to get a faint tickle, which Jaddu managed to pull off..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Gayle's fielding in boots so heavy that it doesn't allow him to move. Standing at short third man, intending to field this outside edge from {{BATSMAN}}, but his feet don't move. And he surrenders to his constraints\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, banged in short and on the stumps, it sat up to be smacked, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and pulls it over mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, round the wicket, fired down leg, {{BATSMAN}} tries a sweep, gets a tickle on it to get it away to (extremely) fine leg for four. Almost long stop. Runs coming in a hurry for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the airrr, and in the gap! Is this Faf's day? He hasn't timed everything as well as Sharjah or Abu Dhabi! This time he ran down the pitch and had a wild swing at the lofted drive, good from Mishy to push it outside off stump and force Faf to fetch that, leading edge actually and it flew between cover and point. Dhawan didn't cut the angle and was slow to take off, he assmued the man at cover would grab that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drops a dolly short for the batsman to slap the ball away through the covers for a four. {{BATSMAN}} is away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, where's third man? No-one there. On a length and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws the bat at that and the edge flies away to the unmanned third man fence, {{BATSMAN}} gets a boundary to get himself going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fantastic touch-play from {{BATSMAN}}! This is the best I have seen him bat in the IPL. It was a good length delivery and there was a hint of room, {{BATSMAN}} gets in a fabulous position and just eases it past backward point for a boundary. Stellar timing!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finally a boundary for {{BATSMAN}}! He was trying to find this gap since quite some time. Goes down on his knee and finds the fence with a nicely timed sweep shot, first one of the innings for him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, all bowlers are proving to be expensive. {{TEAM}} openers are making the most of the powerplay. Again this was a gift of a delivery. Fullish and on the pads as {{BATSMAN}} flicks it nonchalantly away to the fine leg region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, to third man, splits the slips. One slower ball too many, {{BATSMAN}}'s already standing exposing his stumps, swings in desperation and the fat edge is enough to run through the cordon. Who'll plug these in the 18th over ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, guess it was against Pakistan in 2016 World T20 {{BATSMAN}} played a superb knock. He knows the conditions well here. Doesn't move much, gets inside the line of a fullish delivery and lifts the drive over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classy, shot of ther final so far - on a good length and well wide of off. {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and drives it on the up - splits the gap between cover and cover-point, no need to run for those. 16 from the over and Ravi Shastri notes that {{TEAM}} have doubled their score\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, unlucky for the bowler, on a good length and a hint of seam away from the left-hander, drew {{BATSMAN}} into the drive and found a thick edge, past the lone slip and races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is epitome of waywardness. Slips this one down leg, just help-your-self-with-a-boundary ball. {{BATSMAN}} accepts it with glee and walks across to tickle it very fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, seam-up, searching for swing around middle and leg, too easy for {{BATSMAN}} as he shuffles to flick that wide of fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length delivery close to off, {{BATSMAN}} arches back and ramps it over short third man. This is superb from {{BATSMAN}} who's got off to a flier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Vijay Shankar isn't donning a helmet. I reckon, he should. Overpitched outside off, {{BATSMAN}} smacks it down the ground. Shankar did well to evade that by ducking under. That went like a bullet\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, for the second time {{BATSMAN}} uses the pace of {{BOWLER}} to pocket a boundary. Fraction short and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waits in the crease and steers it behind point, Kaul at third man should have done a better job of stopping that. He got there and allowed it to escape past him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, he's looking in excellent touch, {{BATSMAN}} - back of a length and just outside off, not much width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} still stands tall and punches it on the up, past the fielder at cover and runs away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ah, neat. When there's no pace off the pitch, Faf decides to generate some himself. Lovely step away, step down and goes inside-out over mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, muscled over mid-wicket and {{BATSMAN}} manages to find the gap. Didn't time it as he would've liked as it kicked off rapidly off the {{BATSMAN}}ck. {{BATSMAN}} got it high on the bat, enough to beat long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, super shot! Saw the length slightly short and though there wasn't room, he created some by backing away and punched it sweetly wide of the mid-off fielder. Raced away to the fence. Another 50 for {{BATSMAN}} this season! This has been brilliantly paced, was really slow to begin with but is shifting gears with ease now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, creamed through covers by {{BATSMAN}}! Half-volley to greet the batsman as the southpaw nails his drive through perfection, right into the gap and he's off the mark in style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed! Not an error from the bowler, but that shot was all about {{BATSMAN}}'s class. Hawkeyed the ball and freed his arms to slaughter the cut through covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, charges out, goes through with the shot and gets it over the bowler's head for a one bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top-edge and four, banged in short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was a tad late on the pull, the ball caught the fat top-edge and lobbed over MS for another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, dropped short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and clatters it behind square on the off-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picks the length and reverse-sweeps Amit {{BOWLER}} through backward point. There was a slip in place, but he got the timing right. Risky, but worth it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nothing half-tracker, AB's quick to pounce. And he does with a swipe, mowing it into mid-wicket. On, on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely guided away to third man, a slide by Deepak Chahar and he's let the ball go through. Dhoni won't be happy, with the bowler first for needlessly trying stuff, and with the fielder for his effort. Hat-trick of fours now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a whippy sweep-type-clip off the pads as it was too full for {{BATSMAN}} to abort his attempted sweep. So, he bent a little and whipped it away past the dive of the deep square leg fielder for a four. The rate required is now 14.2\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's making a living out of his hands. Nicely keeps his weight distributed between front and back, so he can go either way. Opens the stance and swats this back of a length delivery over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} over-corrects. He doles out a half-volley at 146.4kph outside off. {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and plays the lofted off-drive over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice way to start for {{BATSMAN}}! Premeditates the paddle sweep and makes a fair amount of connection on it as well. Deflected it really fine down the leg-side and it raced away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a real smash-me outside off. Short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets on his tippy toes and flays it with brute power over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four to start the over. {{BATSMAN}} backs away, creates room and hammers this length ball from round the wicket through the covers. Thampi, in the deep, dives and makes a mess of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! That went like a bullet into the fence. Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} jumps and flashes it hard. The ball flies through the point region and races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 145ks short and moving away, {{BATSMAN}} opens the bat slightly and guides it to the left of Rabada at third man who half-stops, but eventually lets it sneak through his palms\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR. Well placed. Needles the gap between mid-off and extra cover with a firm drive. Lot of bottom hand power on that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} almost deceived his man. Saw the batsman advance and pushed it wider, {{BATSMAN}} reached out and lofted it inside out, not off the meat of the bat but had enough to collect a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped! Cutting is the culprit. An ugly hoick attempted from {{BATSMAN}} and he mistimed it horribly. Cutting, at mid-on, went back and got to the ball, but couldn't hold onto it. What's worse? He allows it go for a boundary. It was a good length ball and {{BATSMAN}} was slightly late into his shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smacked. {{BOWLER}}'s slower ball provides width for {{BATSMAN}}, frees his arms and throws his bat. Crashes it in the gap at cover. That sped off the bat in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, perfect length from {{BOWLER}}, fraction fuller and a hint of shape away from off, brought {{BATSMAN}} forward into the defensive push, he nibbled at that, gets a thick edge and the ball races away past the keeper and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drops it short and pays the price. {{BATSMAN}} takes a step forward, takes on this short ball and short-arm pulls it over square leg. One bounce and over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of the bounce and cuts it square past point, beat the diving fielder and raced away to the fence in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full, little wide, the batsman opens the face of the blade and beats the man at deepish point. Much needed four but they need more. Good, intelligent batting from {{BATSMAN}}. 30 off 10 balls\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the slower ball but it's been whacked by {{BATSMAN}}. This is a true surface in terms of bounce, so you can hit through the line, {{BATSMAN}} hits that over wide mid-off and it runs away for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 16 from the over, {{BOWLER}} dropped this one short and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} rocked back and punched it hard - into the gap wide of cover-point, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is {{BATSMAN}}'s riposte. The wrong 'un on a fullish and {{BATSMAN}} used his reach to good effect, pressed forward and struck it straight back over the bowler, couple of bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, didn't get all of it, but with the infield up, anything over them will be a boundary. Full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to go over extra-cover with the lofted hit, sort of sliced it, but had enough on it to clear the ring. Races away and the crowd get going as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that shall give him some confidence. A booster! This was an overpitched delivery by Sandy and Watto caresses it through extra-cover. Beats Williamson who was stationed inside the circle and sends it away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short one outside off, pulled away with very little timing to deep mid-wicket for four as Pollard chases and tries to kick it back, but ends up being carried over the advertising board by the momentum. Hopefully, he hasn't hurt himself\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, whatta start! Gets a flighted ball outside off and has been lifted over cover for a four. That was unexpected. First ball and he went for it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's got the boundary. Full ball outside off, the field is set in a way that there are three fielders to the left of point in a ring, and sweeper cover is pretty straight. So Faf carves this full ball square enough of Rashid in the deep to beat him. What a knock he's playing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, this was the shot that had him against trouble against RCB, but he's played it well here - short of a length at 137 kmph, some extra bounce and {{BATSMAN}} made sure he got on top of it, chops it past the keeper and into the third an ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classy batting, this from SKY! Uses his writs to superb effect. {{BOWLER}} darted a length ball and {{BATSMAN}} superbly clipped it through the mid-wicket region. Split the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on perfectly. The last two balls have spoilt the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 130.1kph, ah, too easy. Leg-lined, leg-cutter and {{BATSMAN}} glances it into the totally empty backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, the pad-tickles will do just as well. {{BOWLER}} slips in radar and {{BATSMAN}} would feel he's missed out on some free runs here, missing the glance, but his pads take it fine enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what is Johnson doing? A regulation stop and he lets it go through his legs. Rohit looks at him in surprise. {{BATSMAN}} moved across and helped the low full toss to fine leg's right. What was at best two became four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a slog. But he has managed to elude mid-wicket leaping. Dragged the flighted delivery from outside off and even though it came off the thickish inside half, it was enough to beat Rohit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! Handy boundary for {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}}. {{BOWLER}} bombarded it short, hustles {{BATSMAN}} for pace as he hooks. Top-edge is found and it sails over Samson\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now the attempted wide yorker goes wrong, full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} crouches a bit and slices it deliberately over backward point, one bounce and over the fence. Wankhede finds its voice again..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundaries continue to flow as {{BATSMAN}} continues to take them on. This was a full length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} manages to heave it over mid-on. Expensive first over by Sran!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, delicate. The googly just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waited for it to arrive, opened the bat face and steers it past the diving short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finally a boundary for Hyderabad! All about timing, this shot was. A floated and full delivery and the batsman chips it straight to long-on. The fielder in the deep was a touch square, hence he couldn't cut this down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full delivery and the batsman has pile-driven the ball down the ground. The man at mid-off was wide enough for the ball to fly into the fence on a bounce\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a shot which can eliminate the hassle of picking the turn. As soon as {{BOWLER}} drifts it close to the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} is down on the crease for the sweep and he slaps this nicely through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, this is {{BATSMAN}} at his best, length ball outside off, he's quick to move across and then paddles it towards the vacant fine leg region, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pitched up delivery and that has been spanked on the up. The ball rockets off the bat and past the dive of the man at cover for another four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracker of a shot! {{BATSMAN}} is in top gear and brings up his 29th IPL fifty in some style. Short and wide, he stands tall and spanks it through backward point. Power, timing and placement all in unison\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, doesn't even spare {{BOWLER}}. Short one, probably the googly, {{BATSMAN}} camps back and pulls it well past the fielder at deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} stays back and cuts past backward point, third man doesn't have a real go. Fours won't do it for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a poor ball! {{BOWLER}} darts a rank half-tracker outside off, cut hard wide of backward point. Easily put away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, magnificent stroke! Not a bad ball by any means. A good length outswinger, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and creams the drive through extra cover. No need to run for shots like that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back to back fours for {{TEAM}}. {{BOWLER}} ushers a short ball at {{BATSMAN}}, no venom and he went back to smoke it in the gap between deep square leg and fine leg. {{BATSMAN}} having a move on here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is not learning. Shifts his line outside off, {{BATSMAN}} knew the third man was inside the ring. Scythed it to his right and it zoomed away into the fence. Smartly done\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mark the calendar! KKR vs SRH - 25th May! KKR win this by 25 runs as they did the choking act much better than {{TEAM}} in the death overs. {{TEAM}}'s dream run has been stalled. The last ball was short, the pull was not controlled but went fine on the on-side for a four. Did not matter\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh shocker. Very short and very wide. With third man up, all {{BATSMAN}} has to do is make some connection, especially with him going so hard. Upper-cuts it over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's just a gentle flick, but this outfield is very fast. Beats the man giving chase from mid-on. Good length delivery on the leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't try to over-hit the ball, placed it to the right of mid-on and opened his account\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that ruins the over for {{BOWLER}}, much needed boundary for {{TEAM}}. Too short and on {{BATSMAN}}'s hips, he gets inside the line and helps it on its way. Fine-leg was inside the ring and once it beat him, there was no way it could be stopped\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, did I sanity? Pardon me. Gayle's partner-in-crime joins the act and creams the full toss outside off away into the covers. The ball raced away into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the outfield here is so quick. Cutter on the pads of {{BATSMAN}} and he tucks it past the square leg umpire. The man behind square on the on-side did not have much to cover, yet the ball beat him to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, backward square is in and {{BATSMAN}} splits him and short fine leg, with a heave. Length ball on off, thick inside edge is enough to go into the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} brings out his sledge hammer! Treks back and clobbers it through mid-wicket. Sheer power and the placement was perfect too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the ramp now! He is pulling out all the tricks from his hat. Short ball bumped in well outside off and the batsman helped it on his way towards third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, latches on the width on offer and flays it away past backward point, a real thrashing that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another backing in, another flat-batted throw, and another hammer over extra cover. Oh he's making it a habit, a very, very lovely-looking habit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this by no means looked convincing. {{BATSMAN}} backed away to open up the off-side field, Patel fired it within the stumps and {{BATSMAN}} was committed to go for it. Dragged it off the cue-end and hits it uppishly, just manages to clear mid-on and earns a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what's those feet for? Stays put, just lumbers up and uses the width on this short ball to slice the cut uppishly through backward point. Placed it delicately behind the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, the wrong 'un from Piyush, but the length is well short, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and clatters it over cover for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} joins the party too. It was slower one a short of length, {{BATSMAN}} swivels, gets in a terrific posiition and thumps it wi{{BATSMAN}} of {{BATSMAN}}ep backward square leg for a boundary.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wrong lines. Off-cutter down leg, {{BATSMAN}} tickles it fine past short fine leg. The fast outfield does the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky! {{BATSMAN}} had made up his mind even before {{BOWLER}} was about to bowl. He crouched low, moved across his stumps and scooped the full toss to the fine leg fence, 17 off the final over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and again. This time the slog-sweep. {{BATSMAN}} is playing a blinder now. Kneels down and nails this sweep, leaves deep square and deep mid as spectators\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full this time from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} lofts over mid-off. {{BOWLER}} is bleeding here and {{BATSMAN}} has raced to 31 off 13\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short, inviting. {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and pulls it in the gap behind square square, there's no-one there and that will be an easy boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shuffles across and flicks a ball from middle stump, easily done. With fine leg inside the ring that was always asking for trouble, {{BATSMAN}} obliged\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length ball that skids a little lower than true, and {{BATSMAN}} opens the face to steer it away to third man for four! A composed shot!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}}'s first boundary of IPL 2020! Whodathunk.. He's been having a lean patch and {{BOWLER}} offered him a freebie. A rank long hop, {{BATSMAN}} had all the time in the world to shift his weight back and pummel it to the deep backward square leg boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now uses the pace and splits short third man and backward point. Played that delightfully late, with a nice clean lean towards off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, for a moment when he sliced that, looked like he had holed out, but perfectly placed between deep cover and long-off. Picked the one that goes away, sliced the loft and it is a one bounce over the ropes four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a release. Full, wide and squeezes it out with a ferocious square drive. Over point and ensures that it keeps wide of third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much needed boundary for {{TEAM}}. It had been a quiet over so far. {{BATSMAN}} didn't connect it properly but struck it in the gap, front leg out of the way and a swing of the arms, couple of bounces and into the cow corner fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fine late cut. Waited for the rising back of a length {{BATSMAN}}livery outsi{{BATSMAN}} off and then played it late, elu{{BATSMAN}}d backward point and gave third man no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, jumps out, takes the ball on the half-volley and then goes straight down the ground. On a bounce and into the fence goes the ball. The use of the feet ensured {{BATSMAN}} got an important four against the leggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's pleading to be pummeled. Short and slides down, {{BATSMAN}} with a brazen-looking pull shot puts it away into the vacant mid-wicket area\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, too short and too wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and clatters it past cover, no chance for the man in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back fours. The power of {{BATSMAN}} coming to the fore. Low full toss, not an easy ball to hit but {{BATSMAN}} muscles it straight of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, here he is! Not wasting any time. He's at it. It's a tossed up delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} grounds his knee and pummels it dead straight over the bowler's head. Four runs!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, put away! A short-and-wide delivery at 150kph, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall in his crease and cuts it superbly behind backward point. Reaches the fence in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hammered! Pressure on the teenager. {{BOWLER}} tries to fire it full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} did well to get under that and drill the drive through extra cover. No chance for Boult from long-off to cut it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is {{BATSMAN}}-madness for you! It was a good length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} moves to the off-side and half-paddle-half-flicks it over short fine. He gets enough bat on it and it lands centimeters short of the boundary ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball and that has been dragged down the ground with powerful sinews. The ball landed close to the man at mid-off and then raced away into the fence for a four. A much needed relief for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, \"Rewind and show me that once again,\" gushes Ian Bishop on air. {{BATSMAN}} oozing class here. Innocous fuller length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stretches across and times it off the meat. Didn't try to over-hit it and focussed more on placement and timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off-pace delivery and once more {{BATSMAN}} read it early, he waited in his crease and stayed leg-side of the ball, lofts it handsomely over the extra cover fielder. All timing there from the Tamil Nadu man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has done it! He was the villain against RCB early in the tournament, not giving strike to Pant. Not today. With seven needed off four balls, he comes in and hits two boundaries. Cheeky shot. Back of the hand slower ball, was a full toss as well. {{BATSMAN}} moved across, waited for a long time and helped it away wide of the keeper. Akshdeep Nath at fine leg, tried his best, but couldn't stop the ball from going past the rope. DD win by 2 wickets\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant placement! There is a fine leg and deep mid-wicket in place but {{BATSMAN}} has bisected them beautifully. Gets on the pads and he duly flicks it through square leg. Called for two but such is the timing that it leaves the deep fielders with no chance of getting to it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that came right off the middle of the bat. Angling in short of length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} jogs down and leg-side-ish to cut it behind a diving backward point. No chance whatsoever for third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nothing lucky here, it's a proper crunch. {{BOWLER}} goes shorter, but ends up dishing out a half tracker, which {{BATSMAN}} can upper-cut now, and there being no third man helps his cause as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very full, very wide, 141.6km/h, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and opens the face, slices it away through the third man region for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, handy runs these for DD. Not a bad delivery by any means. The wide yorker outside off, {{BATSMAN}} crouches low, opens the bat face and steers it past the diving backward point fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is not the place to bowl to {{BATSMAN}} or for that matter any batsman. Short and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} had the width and he slaps it hard through the packed off-side field. No need to run for that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, yup, cover, punch, high-elbows, covers. Typically {{BATSMAN}}. Spots the back of a length early and rocks behind in his crease to not over-hit this crunch, perfectly through the point and extra cover gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and he is away, in style. Gets a tossed up delivery just outside off. Stays leg-side and drives past cover, in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much needed for DD, very full and around off, {{BATSMAN}} gets his left leg out of the way, brings his bottom-hand into play and drills it wide of mid-on, beats the fielder in the ring and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh good bouncer but {{BATSMAN}} has managed to top edge this fine to the fine leg boundary, smiles at the bowler acknowledging that it was a good ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that was an attempted slower delivery but it turned out to be a full toss. Manjrekar on air said how he's never seen {{BOWLER}} bowl \"such a slower ball.\" Anyway, {{BATSMAN}} makes a bit of room and thumps that to the fence through long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets off the mark with a boundary. Pivots back to this short ball and nails the pull in front of square on the on-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, trademark {{BATSMAN}} shot! Backs away and reaches for this fullish ball outside off. Carves it inside out over extra cover. Mid-off is up and there is none to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, fires this one at 120ks around off and beats both the batsman and the wicket-keeper. Frustration creeping in and that delivery by {{BOWLER}} says it all\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overcorrects and lands a fuller length delivery on the pads. {{BATSMAN}} shuffled a bit and that must've put {{BOWLER}} off-guard. Moves inside the line and glances it very fine. The fielder was inside the ring and didn't have any chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sledge-hammered over point by the Kiwi marauder. Picked {{BOWLER}}'s slower ball early, waited and stayed deep to slash it over point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classy shot from {{BATSMAN}}! {{BOWLER}} provides a floaty half volley and it's creamed through the gap at cover. Lovely timing and it raced away. {{TEAM}} are away in style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, exactly what he could have done with the third ball this over. Short and wide again, {{BATSMAN}} gets his back foot across and slaps it past backward point. The ball rockets to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, walks across, gets underneath this back of a length delivery and scoops it fine. He's been different class tonight\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nails this one. {{BATSMAN}} is keen to take {{BOWLER}} on. Sees it floated up into the left-hander and launches the slog-sweep over mid-wicket. Clean strike\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third boundary of the over and {{BOWLER}} leaking runs here. Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink at that and the ball flies off the outside edge, over Faf at slip and into the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, all about class! Down on his knee early and picks the slower delivery over fine leg for a boundary. Was the slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} played the lap shot to perfecion. Almost got a six as the ball hit the cushions on a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is having a ball out there. Middling almost everything. On one knee, gets underneath a flighted delivery and loft-drives {{BOWLER}} over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fired on the leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} gets on his knee and plays the fall-over Kanhai sweep to the fine leg fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} ends his spell with a four. He has taken quite a beating today. Overpitches this time, {{BATSMAN}} accepts the gift with glee and drills it through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a ground version of the helicopter. Not only does he share the same state, he shares the same shots too with the big man. The slower yorker, takes an eternity to dip down. Enough for the adjustment and a chopper to be unleashed. Talk about the precision in the placement too. Surgical in bisecting the two men at the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the angle works against {{BOWLER}}. He slips on the pads and that is easy pickings, {{BATSMAN}} got some wood on that, the ball then deflected off the pad to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, throws his hands at this wide ball that's been angled across by {{BOWLER}} from over the wicket. And gets away. Backspins and beats the keeper to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, intentional! {{BATSMAN}} waits for this seam-up delivery and opens the face of the bat at the last moment to get this one past the keeper to his right, races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Chahal fails to cut it off. He gave it his best, sprinting across and diving from deep backward point but couldn't get a strong enough hand. But how well has {{BATSMAN}} timed this yorker. It's very close to the blockhole if not right in it, but {{BATSMAN}} slices it superbly through the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swept away! Down on his knee as he sweeps the loopy delivery past the man at deep square leg for four runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} goes slightly to the off-side and sweeps it fine of the stumps, ball goes fine of the short fine leg fielder for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, further dismissive. {{BOWLER}} overcorrects his line, goes outside off, but the length remains just as friendly. Matters taken over the covers now, leg-bent, hands flowing and creaming it one-bounced\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} drags it over the infield at mid-wicket. There were two fielders in the deep but this was placed right into the gap as he heaved the length ball across\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's what he can do! Right into the slot around middle and leg, hint of tail into the batsman and it's been whiplashed past the man at mid-on by QdK\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picks the bones out of that dead meat of a slower ball! Charges out, gets hold of the length and goes through with the lofted hit to send it packing through the covers. Was aerial and landed a few times before the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wayward ball. Slips it down leg and {{BATSMAN}} clips it square of the man at short fine leg. Easily put away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a perfect example of a square cut. Was another short delivery outside off and {{BATSMAN}} was on to it in a flash. Rocks back and chops it right into the gap between point and cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, signature {{BATSMAN}} start! Wastes no time to get going. Brings out the reverse sweep and takes this on the full, makes enough connection to beat a diving backward point. Finds the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} falls as he attempts that pull on the short of length ball but he gets enough bat and finds the gap through deep mid-wicket for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} helps it on its way with a flick of his wrists. So easily done. 50 runs from the last 2 overs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets a long hop. A rank one. And all he has to do is decide where to deposit this one. Decides mid-wicket it is again to take the brunt. Ensures that he doesn't get up early and once again puts his spinning back foot to use in whisking it into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}}'s radar goes haywire. Spills it on the pads, easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}} as he gets inside the line and flicks it past the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky edge. {{BATSMAN}} has no clue which way this one's spinning, sticks his bat out away from his body desperately and runs it just wide of the diving slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top shot! This is {{BATSMAN}} at his best. The slider which skids on from a fullish length, {{BATSMAN}} makes room, exposes his stumps and drives it inside out through the packed off-side field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, that should release some pressure off {{BATSMAN}}, comes down the track, flat-bats the short of a length delivery and lifts it back over {{BOWLER}}'s head, a few bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft touch this time from {{BATSMAN}}! Uses the pace of {{BOWLER}} and steers it with an open bat face. Splits the slip and gully fielder to pick up a boundary. Smart batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what batting. Must have picked it from the hand. Reverses the bat and sends the quicker dart outsi{{BATSMAN}} off wi{{BATSMAN}} of short third. MS tried to get his legs in the way of the ball - as he always does, but placed so well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, something to cheer for {{TEAM}} fans. Short ball and has been pulled away into the on-side past deep square leg. He got hold of the short ball and muscled it away into the on-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and punished! I mean it wasn't all that short, but {{BATSMAN}} is quick to pick the length. Treks back in the crease does the opener and slams it through mid-wicket, that's four more! {{BOWLER}} proving to be slightly expensive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a pacy full-toss on the pads, 142.4km/h, whipped away with utmost ease to the deep mid-wicket fence for four. All timing.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, candyfloss. Cracking shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Leans forward and caresses it through the packed off-side field. Eventful start for DD\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length, doesn't quite hurry on from the surface, and that's all class from {{BATSMAN}} - opens the face and steers it away to the deep backward point fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pulled away! Short of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} camps back and pulls it nicely through the gap at mid-wicket, was timed sweetly by the skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off the radar again. Width on offer as he bowls a length delivery. {{BATSMAN}} goes back in his crease and caresses it through the gap at covers for the third boundary of this over. Dealing in boundaries is Surya at the moment\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, paddle-scoops a leg-drifter to the fine leg fence, good placement\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is trying too much here. Bangs it in short and offers ample width outside off for {{BATSMAN}} to free his arms. {{BATSMAN}} jumps and elevates it over point. It came right off the middle of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! {{BATSMAN}} won't mind it. {{BOWLER}} starts with a carrom ball, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and swings through the line, the outside edge runs away fine to the third man fence\n",
            "San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes full this ball and that's been smacked {{BATSMAN}}lightly, {{BATSMAN}}licately through the other si{{BATSMAN}} of the wicket -- San{{BATSMAN}}ep is from over the wicket to AB here. Takes the ball on the up and disparages it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good batting that from {{BATSMAN}}. His eyes lit up for the tossed up delivery outside off and a perfect execution of the slog sweep. Finds the cow corner fence on the bounce\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half-volley right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't need to get forward just leans into it with the powerful forearms and thrashes it through deep extra cover for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, let's say {{BOWLER}}'s gotten obsessed with bowling yorkers. More yorkers. Better yorkers. He wants redemption for that boundary that {{BATSMAN}} hit earlier in the over. Goes for one again, bowls a low full toss on leg-stump instead -- how? why? what? -- and is flicked round the corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lofted over extra cover. He's one of the best manipulators on the off-side. But {{BOWLER}} keeps providing him with freebies like these. Pitched fuller and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} shifts his weight forward and handsomely lifts it over the in-field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, second boundary of the over. Flatter from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} went low and executes the reverse sweep, hitting it over short third man's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, two fielders run across, see each other and neither go for the ball. Comical. Two overseas fielders - Roy and Boult. Was a low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} got underneath it to bunt it over the bowler's head. Long-on should have cut that off. Ordinary stuff!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, on a good length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} does a little shimmy, gets close to the ball and drills it wide of mid-off. No need to run for those. 15 from the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, we have seen this in the last game! Anything short and {{BATSMAN}} will pounce on it. Gets another back of a length dart wide of off-stump, he transfers his weight onto the back foot and drills it wide of mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, up and over {{BOWLER}}. Quicker the delivery and {{BATSMAN}} is so much more comfortable. Low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} walks across and tonks it over the bowler. No chance for long-on or long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} reminding everyone that he has the second fastest ODI hundred. The extra delivery costing {{BOWLER}} four runs. Length delivery right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} slams it straight down the ground. Almost knocked the umpire off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the pitch is slow? What are you talking! PP evokes those emotions now. He chips a gorgeous drive over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, some width on the cutter, and that cut shot creams past Lewis's dive at deep cover. Just slid through the ball there, cutting the trajectory at 90 degrees. Must be a good outfield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} shows some {{BATSMAN}}ftness. Uses the pace of this {{BATSMAN}}livery, goes {{BATSMAN}}ep in his crease and gui{{BATSMAN}}s it past backward point. Cleverly done\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of a good length and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and punches with a straight bat, finds the gap past cover-point and the ball rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, excellent from the senior {{BATSMAN}}. How late he played that? Didn't have any room there at all to free his arms. So, he stayed back, opened his bat face and glided it in the gap between short third man and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, well controlled pull shot from {{BATSMAN}}. And it will fetch him four. It was on a short of length and was around tummy height, {{BATSMAN}} gets in a good position and places the pull shot incredibly well. It beats fine leg for a boundary. He is complimenting {{BATSMAN}} pretty well!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the extra delivery and a boundary conceded. That's what you call small margins in cricket. Misses the yorker and offers a low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} dinks it over extra cover and the timing is such that it beats long-off comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor effort by Bhajji near short fine leg. Perhaps he slipped there, hence couldn't stop the ball. This was a short one down the leg-side and {{BATSMAN}} pulled it away, beating Harbhajan at short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drifting down leg, so {{BATSMAN}} doesn't have to worry about the leg-before. He goes down on the back knee and sweeps hard, sending it fine of short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more to {{BATSMAN}}! {{BOWLER}} trusts his instincts and tries the yorker, misses it by a few inches and {{BATSMAN}}, in this form, won't miss out. Whips it off his pads behind square and collects another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Surgical precision from {{BATSMAN}}. Two fielders dived but in vain. Juicy half-volley from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} gets his front foot across and nails the drive fabulously through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, threatens with the bouncer, but {{BATSMAN}}'s not not taking it on. He's waiting deep in the crease just for it and swivels in his hook to put it away very fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's been superb with the pick-up shots today. Anything on the pads, SKY has dispatched it disdainfully. Here's another instance. Full down leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets across and whips it cleanly behind square. In the gap and zooms away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, here we go, {{BATSMAN}} gets off the blocks. Rubbish half tracker from {{BOWLER}}, not much bounce but {{BATSMAN}} crouches low and slaps the pull into the gap at deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is brilliant from {{BATSMAN}}, again proving his value and ability with the bat. Such a terrific cricket shot. Flighted up outside off, he stretches onto the ball and creams the drive through extra cover. Superb timing to beat long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is turning out to be an excellent start from {{TEAM}}. {{BOWLER}} overcompensates and bowls one full and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the track, gets down on one knee and drills it past extra-cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} finally dispatches one against {{BOWLER}}. It was a very full delivery and was on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and squeezes the drive wide of cover for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hit hard! {{BATSMAN}} uses his feet to good effect. Dances down the ground to convert it into a half-volley and drills it down the ground. Long-on had no chance to mop that up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first ball. Shuffles and kills the inswing with a whippy clip, embarrassing us for all the bottom hand strength we don't have. Plays it real fine behind the wicket and gets a first-ball boundary to get off the mark\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played. {{BOWLER}} deceived {{BATSMAN}} with a slower ball, but the latter adjusts well to roll his wrist and flick it fine past the fielder at 45. Good start to the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flat and full on off, {{BATSMAN}} hammers it straight and got enough power to beat the diving fielder at long-off. Crowd going bonkers now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is excellent batting from {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} went short and wide of off as {{BATSMAN}} backed away, he waits on it, uses the pace of the bowler and taps it on its head, splits the gap between backward point and short third man to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, blasted away! Much-needed for {{TEAM}}. Gets width on offer and he was hanging back for the slap-cut. Smashed hard and it's wide of sweeper as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drags the length down. Very defensively. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't have time to pat things back tonight. He chases, hard, and powers it behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh no! Even good deliveries are going for runs. Sloppy bit of work from Narine. {{BOWLER}} nails it in the blockhole, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and gets his bat down in the nick of time, squeezes it to short fine and Narine ends up diving over the ball. {{BOWLER}} is not impressed with the effort\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh this goes at a catchable height but there is no one at extra-cover. Would have been a straightforward chance. {{BATSMAN}} is certainly having trouble facing {{BOWLER}}'s angle, chips gently, was a poor shot and he'd say that he deliberately played that with that gap on the off-side. Didn't look convincing though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, he isn't afraid of playing his shots - banged in short and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across and pulls it over square leg, no one in the deep and it's another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sees the tossed up delivery and is onto that in a flash. Skips down and blasts it straight down the ground. Clean strike and went the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swings a bit outside off. {{BATSMAN}} takes that into account, clears the leg and cracks the drive over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, up and over! Loosener from {{BOWLER}} to start with, wide half volley and {{BATSMAN}} just ensures that he clears the infield. That he does so with a front-footed lofted chip over cover. Easily done\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, strays on the fuller side with length, on the pads with the line, flicked nonchalantly over the man at short fine leg for a four. {{BATSMAN}} is away!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, expertly done by {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} went for the slower short ball but {{BATSMAN}} was upto the challenge. Jumped high and plays the pull off the front foot over mid-wicket. Generates some power and collects four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is why the first ball to {{BATSMAN}} was into the batsman. A bit of width and {{BATSMAN}}'s found the room to slash it disembowelingly wide of backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, improvisation at its best. Reverses his stance even before the ball is delivered and brooms it away between short third man and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a tired dive from Zaheer at backward point. He's struggling with his hamstring too, so can't really blame him. But {{BOWLER}} is just seething. He turns around in disgust. But this is awful bowling to begin with. Bowls it short and wide again, and {{BATSMAN}} slices it neatly to the left of Zaheer. A younger fielder would have stopped that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} ends another expensive over with a good length {{BATSMAN}}livery on off and middle, flicked through mid-wicket, in the air but in the gap. He again looks in the mood today and that's bad news for RR fans\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misfield by Kedar Jadhav at sweeper cover. This was absolutely smashed through the off side by {{BATSMAN}}, but the fielder couldn't stop it in the deep. Dhoni applauds him for the effort though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, don't bowl short to {{BATSMAN}}. You just't can't, {{BOWLER}}. It was short and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} cuts it formidably well, beats point and cover and it races to the fence in a canter\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hundred for {{BATSMAN}} and another {{TEAM}} batsman is thrilled to bits - rushes half-way towards the {{TEAM}} dressing room, delight on his face as he punches his fist - raises his bat and acknowledges the applause from the Orange Army - full-toss and it was squeezed behind square on the off-side. Backward point dived, but to no avail\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a heap of runs. A half-tracker, then the googly starting from middle and spinning well down leg. {{BATSMAN}} isn't happy pocketing a wide, he reaches leg-sided, connects and heaves it into fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short. Down leg. But {{BATSMAN}} refuses to relent. Keeps the dancing shoes on. Gets inside the line and pulls it away past the lurking short fine. This is murder. Call 100\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh another freebie from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} cashes in with a sublime straight drive. Low full toss, misses the yorker and {{BATSMAN}} plants his front leg forward, drilling it ram-rod straight and shows his bat maker's name. Long-off and long-on fielders were mere spectators\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, chance? Nope, seems to have dropped just in front of Devdutt at long-off. A toe-ended swat from {{BATSMAN}}, dumps it to the left of Devdutt, who bolted to his left and went for the catch. But the ball dipped and unfortunately, he couldn't get his body behind the line as well. Four more to {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done! Shortish delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} hops, gets on top of the bounce and forces it wide of point. The ball races away into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drags it towards the on-side with a clouted pull to deep mid-wicket for four. Boult made a lot of room, running across a few yards and diving in front, and nearly pulled off a screamer but the ball flicks his thumb and ricochets away into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, too straight and on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he allows it to come onto it, closes the face of the bat and glances it fine, beats the keeper and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a rare bad ball from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it. On seeing {{BATSMAN}} shuffle forward, {{BOWLER}} loses his length and feeds a full toss at the body, {{BATSMAN}} knows where the gap is and he swats it for a one-bounce boundary over square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, width on offer outside off. {{BATSMAN}} chases it with a slash and gets a fat outside edge. The ball flies past the slip fielder and races away past the ropes. Hits the laptop in the {{TEAM}} dugout. Probably, the one that of the statsman\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunched away! Full and quite wide outside off, right up {{BATSMAN}}'s street and he feasts on it. Unfurls a lovely square drive through cover-point. Blazed away in a flash\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hammered away. {{BATSMAN}} is on a roll here. Baffling though to see KW hand the ball to a left-arm spinner in the Powerplay with the ball not really turning. Fuller ball around middle and leg, lofted cleanly over mid-on and it races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four. 14 off the opening over. Streaky, but {{BATSMAN}} wouldn't mind much. The ball came in with the angle and {{BATSMAN}} got an inside edge on his push, runs away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} backed away to free his arms and unlike Narine, {{BOWLER}} tosses it up on the stumps, right sort of room to play the drive and {{BATSMAN}} places it perfectly past extra cover, even beat long-off to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, tad too full and too wide from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and drills it over cover, one bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheekily experimental. An early premeditated lapped-scoop on realizing that there's no short fine leg, and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't mind walking all the way across his stumps if he has to. Doesn't find the middle, but the ballooning miscue is just as good\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fortune favours the brave, they say. Back of a length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} is a touch early as he swings across the line but the top-edge is enough to fetch him four more, with the fielder inside the circle at third man, this was bound to happen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, yorker length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} tries squeezing it away, nutmegs Dhoni to the long stop fence for four byes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} rubs salt into RCB's wounds. Fullish and stops on the pitch a bit, {{BATSMAN}} didn't go with full conviction, just checks his loft straight down the ground and it races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, harmless short of length delivery, sits up nicely, {{BATSMAN}} powers off the back foot over mid-wicket. He's keeping them in the game big time. Mumbai will want to hunt him down quickly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wickets are tumbling at one end but {{BATSMAN}} continues to impress. Arches back to this short ball and ramps it over the keeper. A couple of bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, thank you {{BOWLER}} says {{BATSMAN}} as he clips a leg-side dross fine to claim his first boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Typical {{BATSMAN}}! Reverses his stance and wallops the sweep over backward point. With both the deep fielders on the on-side, that's an excellent shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fist pump from {{BATSMAN}} as he gets to his fifty! Seems determined to make a statement tonight and to be honest, it's been his best knock in ages. Fractionally short and he dispatches the pull over mid-wicket. There is a man in the deep but Jinks has placed it wider. He is flowing freely at the moment, needs to bat through from {{TEAM}}'s POV\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finally a boundary after 30 balls. Gets the crowd and cheerleaders going. They have been quiet all evening. Low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} drives it uppishly wide of extra cover, Finch at long-off gave up the chase very early\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, trademark {{BATSMAN}} shot! Dances down to a fast bowler and thwacks this length ball down the ground. No chance for the bowler and the ball reaches the fence in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the man at sweeper cover is of no use when {{BATSMAN}} hits the ball like this. Can perhaps just help retrieve the ball from the fence. Full and quite wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bludgeons this through the covers. Nobody moved at all\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clears his front leg. Goes conventional. Full meat, over the bolwer, and trickling further in. Deadly death batting this\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a lovely piece of timing from {{BATSMAN}}. Should get him going. Not easy to jump down the pitch to a pacy bowler. In fact this came down at 148kph, {{BATSMAN}} made it into a fuller length by using his feet and played an excellent off-drive, the dive goes in vain from mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and pulled away. {{BATSMAN}} didn't hit it as well as he would've liked to, but gets a one bounce over the ropes four at deep square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is really poor bowling! Low full toss down leg, {{BATSMAN}} flicks, fine leg in, it's a sin to bowl there. {{BATSMAN}} calmly glances knowing the field and collects four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets off the mark with a boundary! Opens his bat-face at the last moment and steers this away-swinging length ball wide of the slip fielder. Neatly done\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower one, possibly knuckle, on a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} just picks the perfect moment in time to let leather meet willow with that authoritative whip away to deep mid-wicket for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} hits the winning runs. Slower ball wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat at it and slices it wide of backward point, who put in the dive. Runs away to the fence and that's it. {{TEAM}} win by 6 wickets!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a good shot! The batsman seemed to have been deceived by the short ball. He adjusted well, jumped and pulled fiercely through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, young man is under pressure. It was another full toss and {{BATSMAN}} with this form is not going to miss out. He connects well and places it well through fine leg for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and {{BOWLER}} errs in length. He goes full and {{BATSMAN}} is just too good there, extension of the arms and lofts it over extra cover, the ball has enough to trickle into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that flat-batted swipe coming down the track to a length ball. Made room, slapped it inside out to deep extra cover for four past a diving cover. He's absolutely leathered that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} steps across and paddle-scoops this off the stumps. Long chase for Cottrell running across from long leg. Puts in a big dive but to no avail\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} have demolished KXIP! Not the fairytale big hit to finish but a boundary nevertheless. Short ball and {{BATSMAN}} only manages a top edge on the pull. Gets it comfortably over a leaping Rahul and that's the end of that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, so lucky {{BATSMAN}} is there. Tries to drive a full ball from off and almost chops it on. The ball misses the stumps and rolls to the fine leg boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, expensive start from {{BOWLER}}, it was the slower ball, but it gave {{BATSMAN}} plenty of time to spot it. He makes room and carves it inside out over cover, a couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's nailed that extra-cover drive too. {{BOWLER}} under the pump for the first time this season. A little shimmy down the pitch to get close to the pitch and drills it with the turn\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that wasn't a well timed shot by {{BATSMAN}} will take it. Short ball outside off, slow in place and {{BATSMAN}} cuts it over point. That was in the air and as he played it over the infield, he managed to beat the fielders\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short, wide, turning away, {{BATSMAN}}, who was initially pressing forward, goes deep in the crease and scythes it through covers. Powerfully hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misses the length. Dishes out a full toss and {{BATSMAN}} piles on. Ensures that he bisects the two men in the off-side at the fence and gets it wide enough with his murderous drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now he's opened his stance completely here. Chest facing the bowler as he reverses this over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brutal. Fraction short and that's enough for {{BATSMAN}}, who marmalises the back foot forcing shot. Long-off wasn't even in the picture. A rare off night for {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sloppy! The low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was trying to slice it behind point, got it finer than he would have liked. Jayant at third man makes a meal of that. Allows it to escape past him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} welcomes {{BOWLER}} with a boundary. Another venom-less shortish ball, {{BATSMAN}} pulls it hard behind square on the on-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, Kedar Jadhav is having a torrid time behind the wicket. Flighted just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drives and misses, he was undone by the lack of bounce and Jadhav is nutmegged. He should have had his legs together\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a bonus for {{TEAM}}. Don't think they're looking to attack {{BOWLER}}, but he himself has presented a half-tracker. {{BATSMAN}} happily belts the pull wide of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, two fours in a row for {{BATSMAN}}. This was a poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, drifts one on the pads, all {{BATSMAN}} had to do was to get some wood on it, which he did and it races away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top-edge and four, another lucky boundary for {{BATSMAN}}, banged in short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivelled across on the pull, gets a fat top-edge that lobs over short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done! It wasn't too wide, {{BATSMAN}} jumped back and slightly moved leg-side. And then, the lefty opened his bat-face to guide it fine of short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the leg spinner has been put under pressure right away! {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knee and sweeps the tossed up delivery over square leg, four more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's raining boundaries here! It was on a fuller length and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} plunges forward and times the drive incredibly well. The placement was excellent too, it beats backward point and third man. And canters to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! {{BATSMAN}} is full flow here. {{BOWLER}} is not learning. Pitches it up in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} keeps a solid base and dumps it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a friendly dart outsi{{BOWLER}} off stump, {{BATSMAN}} makes use of the width on offer and gli{{BOWLER}}s late with an angled bat wi{{BOWLER}} of short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the sound of the bat when it met leather! Wow. Pitched up delivery and smoked past mid-off. Russell put in a pool-like dive but in vain. The pitched up deliveries aren't working\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a good cut. Dangerous but {{BATSMAN}} plays late and takes it from off, delays the shot to get it wide of the diving Umesh at short third. Much needed boundary for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off the top-edge or the glove, the ball lobs over Naman Ojha and runs away to the boundary. {{BATSMAN}} was rushed on the pull on this occasion. The line from {{BOWLER}} cramped him up too. But he still gets the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done! Not a shot that you'd normally assocciate with {{BATSMAN}}. Short of a length ball outside off and the lefty used the bowler's pace to guide it through backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full from {{BOWLER}}, infact it ends up as a low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} drives it elegantly through the covers. Probably looked for that in-swinging delivery but couldn't land it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, two fours in a row. \"He is looking ominous here,\" says Ravi Shaz on air. This was a half-volley on fifth stump line, {{BATSMAN}} brings those quicksilver wrists of his into play. Just gets inside the line and whips it past mid-on. Goes to the fence like a 'famous bullet phrase' to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full and too straight from {{BOWLER}}, on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads and his neat little flick is good to get past the diving short fine fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top-edge and four, pushed through quicker and sliding down leg, {{BATSMAN}} was down on his knees as he swept, off the top-edge and went wide of the fielder in the circle at short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, moves all around in his crease. Then sits. And turns right handed. {{BOWLER}} meanwhile fires in a low full toss. Only to watch it be slogged through the tiny gap in the cover fortress\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, four sixes on the trot - this is a stunning cameo from {{BATSMAN}} - length ball at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and lifts it high and over long-off.. and the third umpire decides that the front-foot is just over, called as a no-ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pressure-releasing over from {{BOWLER}}. After a great opening over where he picked up two wickets for no run, he leaks 17 in his second. Drags it too short, {{BATSMAN}} was quick to pick the length as he pivots back and bashes it through extra cover. This outfield is very quick and there's no stopping those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! Streaky but {{BATSMAN}} would take it. It was on a good length and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to drive it away from the body. He plays down the wrong line and inside edge takes it wide of stumps and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short perhaps and Faf powers it through mid-wicket with a crisp pull off the bottom hand, picked the length early and got onto his back foot in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, make it a hat-trick of boundaries - this is poor bowling from {{BOWLER}} - dropped short and on off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} made room and cracked it square on the off-side for yet another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, switches to round the wicket for {{BATSMAN}}, misses the yorker by a few inches, {{BATSMAN}} smashes the low full toss straight down the ground. No chance for long-on or long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the boundaries from {{BATSMAN}} continue to flow. On the pads and the batsman does well to get down and sweep it sweetly to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he wants to go only one way - through the off-side. This is a good shot, hammers it hard and wide of extra-cover, who didn't dive. It was a quicker one and on the stumps, but {{BATSMAN}} found the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clears the front leg, adopts the line and then reintroduces the ball into the fence. After quite some time. Much needed this for the crowd to find their lost voice back. Sinks and lofts the drive through the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fuller ball on the pads and clipped away past the square leg umpire for a four. Poor from {{BOWLER}}. Too full and put away off the pads\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short one on the thigh and {{BATSMAN}} drags it down to the fine leg fence. {{BOWLER}} has struggled with his lines so far. Bowled a few looseners in his first over too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, plenty of width outside off, the hard part for {{BATSMAN}} is to stretch out to meet it. So it's commendable that his timing is still so great as he smears it through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, neatly done! He waits and the ball was outside off, dabs it past Gayle at slip and the chasing fielder had no chance. Raced away..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this will do. This will do for {{TEAM}}. Slower ball but {{BOWLER}} landed that way too short, pulled powerfully through mid-wicket and it's well wide of the fielder in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gee! He is in some form these days, few months back, he would have hit it straight to cover. But, not now! He clobbers it over cover, bat turns in his hands but that didn't make any difference. It canters to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the perfect yorker. Right in the blockhole. Deserved nothing lesser than respect. Gets the boundary to its name instead. {{BATSMAN}} just about jams his bat down in the way, gets the inside edge and then banks on his luck to take it past the stumps\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just short of a half-volley, not quite to the pitch, {{BATSMAN}} just goes through the line and lofts it over mid-off towards the long-off boundary for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, fuller length delivery outside off, drew {{BATSMAN}} into the drive - went with hard hands and the edge flew through the empty slip cordon for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is class for you! Certainly not all that a bad ball, but {{BATSMAN}}'s in the mood. Short of a length, just outside off stump, so he had to manufacture a bit of space for himself to be able to cut that ball. He jumps and then backs away slightly to cut it away to the right of backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just past a flying Buttler to his right! Excellent bowling from {{BOWLER}}, totally bamboozled {{BATSMAN}} with this off cutter and induced a thick edge on the drive. Buttler did all he could with a dive to his right but couldn't reach it. Raced away fine to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a signature {{BATSMAN}} stroke. Not all that full but there was width and that's what the southpaw loves. Uses his quick hands to power it on the up through the gap at cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's where {{BATSMAN}} is so good. Anything near his pads and he will not allow the bowler to get away. Full on leg stump and he just whipped it over mid-wicket. The uncorking of the wrists and the ball flew over the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, whatta start! A wide half-volley, {{BATSMAN}} leans into the square drive and caresses it behind point and wide of third man for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheekiness at its best! Knuckle ball from {{BOWLER}} well outside off. The ball almost went past him, and {{BATSMAN}} opens his bat face at the very last instant. The ball runs away into the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is looking in sublime touch! Width on offer from {{BOWLER}}, a gentle loosener to start, he leans back and cuts it square on the off-side, beats the fielder in the ring and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, the shot of the day so far, fraction short and just wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats cover and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now makes room to a ball that was always going to be fuller, and slaps it through covers. Top shot as a follow up to that brute of a ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more runs! This is a good counterattack from {{BATSMAN}}. Not in control this time as he goes for a flashy drive, slices it wide of the slip and once again, it's wide of gully and races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, it slips out of {{BOWLER}}'s hand. And this is not the first time it has happened. It was a full-toss above the waist height and {{BATSMAN}} reaches for it and smashes it wide of third man for a boundary. Free-hit coming up!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Pure timing from {{BATSMAN}}. Stands tall to this short ball and cuts past the man at backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fuller and slower, thumped down the ground! That was blasted past the bowler. {{BOWLER}} had no chance. Have SRH made a mistake by giving it to {{BOWLER}}?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 3rd full-toss from Bhuvi! Low full-toss around off, {{BATSMAN}} punches that to sweeper cover for four. Pure timing!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, absolutely smashed! {{BATSMAN}} premeditates the length and charges down the track, holds his shape and nails the pull over mid-wicket. Total nonchalance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, leading edge for four. The ball just eluded Yuvraj's reach at backward point as he dived to his left. There was just enough nibble for {{BOWLER}} as {{BATSMAN}} closed his bat-face too early. But he timed the edge wonderfully, if that's a thing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} swings and swings hard at it. He wanted to drive it through cover, it hits the inside half of the blade and goes wide of square leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! What a shot to get off the mark. Length ball right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} to swing his bat. Stands tall and lofts the on-drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another one dropped short, {{BATSMAN}} gets his weight onto the backfoot and smokes the pull to the long-on fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lots of flighted and lands as a half volley, {{BATSMAN}} gets a good stride forward and drives it past Henriques at extra cover, the timing was superb as long-off had no chance of cutting that off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's brave from {{BATSMAN}}, but he knew what he was doing, fetches this well tossed up delivery from well and slogs it over mid-wicket, there's no one in the deep and {{BATSMAN}} gets going with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short, wide and four, {{BATSMAN}} has plenty of width on offer as he scythes this one past point, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, quality shot! Typical {{BATSMAN}} as he leans forward, converts the length into a slight full one and creams it through the gap on the off side. Looks batting look so effortless\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets lucky. Very lucky. A thick inside edge that on another day would've gone onto the stumps, misses them and runs away wide of short fine leg. The fielder didn't dive as well. Good length and on off, {{BATSMAN}} was late on the attempted dab\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a very unlike Bhuvi over. He was all over the place this over. Shortish delivery outside off, you don't offer width to this guy. Flays the bat hard at it and lifts it over the infield on the off-side. Bullets into the cover fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, driven hard into the square and it bounces to the right of the man at cover, Rashid tries to hunt it down, but can't cut it off in time, he flicked the ball but it touched the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is seeing the ball really well. And he is placing them well too. He goes on the back foot and pulls it wide of deep mid-wicket. Doesn't try to hit it too hard, placement was the key\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's unfortunate for {{BOWLER}}. He's deceived {{BATSMAN}} for lack of pace while also bowling it wide of off with {{BATSMAN}} swinging leg-side. The cutter grips a touch, takes a thick edge and flies fine of short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, such an artist! This was darted around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it to arrive and heaves it into the huge gap at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length ball and that's been swatted away. Rocks back, opens his stance and swivels a boundary through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top thinking. He's spotted third man inside the ring, and ramps his bat out to shove it over. Wrong line, wrong length\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} does a ABD. The reverse sccop. Full delivery and close to the yorker length, {{BATSMAN}} switches his stances and sends it over the short third man fielder, almost went the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this spins more, so this is the googly from back fo the hand. {{BATSMAN}} gets into a shape to sweep nicely and brooms it away through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stands tall and slaps a 137ks good length delivery past Virat Kohli at mid-off, played it with a flat bat and managed to pierce the gap between mid-off and extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gee, how quickly did that reach the fence? {{BOWLER}} bowls a gentle full ball outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} crashes it through cover and picks up a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} fans give {{BATSMAN}} a standing ovation as the opener gets to his fifty with a boundary. Waits for the slower delivery and whips it through the gap at mid-wicket to send the ball away to the fence. Has been a crucial knock but he needs to get a move on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets down the wicket and slaps that over deep extra cover for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for the youngster. Gets one short ball down the leg side and {{BATSMAN}} drags it past the fielder at short fine leg. Kohli's expressions say it all, not a great line to bowl\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drops the ball short and that is a sin! The huge bat of {{BATSMAN}} comes down on it and swords the ball away past cover point for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes down low, reverses his stance and scoops the reverse-sweep over short third man. {{BATSMAN}} rattling along. 30 off 13 balls now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slides down the leg-side. {{BATSMAN}} helps it fine off the inside part of the willow. Races to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor bowling from {{BOWLER}}. He tries the slower delivery when his natural deliveries were causing all sorts of problem, sits up as a half tracker and {{BATSMAN}} dismisses it with a pull in front of square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shortish. {{BATSMAN}} sees early and shapes back to cut, beats the dive from the fielder at cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, banged in short and on the stumps, it sat up to be smacked, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and pulls it over mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} was on the charge for a moment but saw the length early. It was a bit shortish outside off and {{BATSMAN}} fetched the pull from there, hit it all along the ground to the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, this was dropped short and well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and then dabs it past MS's gloves, RJ has his hands on his head, but that was supremely well played\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another boundary for {{BATSMAN}}. In no time, he has moved to 41. It was short and was on the body, {{BATSMAN}} somehow manages to pull it fine of fine-leg for a boundary. It looked extremely clumsy but got four runs for it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's an antidote to everything that {{BOWLER}} can be tonight. Backs away and lofts one at the stumps, splitting the air-gap between mid-off and extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, skates down the pitch, stays leg-side of the delivery and carves Varun {{BOWLER}} over extra cover. The batsman in {{BATSMAN}} speaks...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is excellent batting from {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} dropped this one short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room, lets the ball go past him and then cuts it square behind point for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, help-yourself-with-a-boundary ball, although {{BATSMAN}} didn't get any bat on it, still it's a boundary for {{TEAM}}. Did he try the slower ball? Could be.. however the line was poor. Slanted it down leg, {{BATSMAN}} misses the glance and it goes off the pads, beats Samson and runs away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes straight. From the back of the hand goes {{BOWLER}}, flighting it full and {{BATSMAN}} is quickly down slamming it down, with all the anger\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot again. Makes room as he charges out and clouts it inside-out over extra cover. He'll keep doing that all day\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that ball went searching for the middle of the blade. {{BATSMAN}} was in such a good position, everything right about it; reads the length early, punches crisply in the gap behind point with a still head. Take four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Samson dives at deep point, but this kept curving away from him. Was a short ball again and {{BATSMAN}}'s square-cut fetched him four runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that was not needed. Dhoni wouldn't be happy with that. {{BATSMAN}} had eased this one back to the bowler and {{BOWLER}} has a needless overthrow to give them four bonus runs. Would have been a dot ball, but he threw it down leg and Dhoni had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's an awful ball from {{BOWLER}}. Offers width, by bowling it well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in his crease and carves it over point. 50-run stand comes up between the two\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss and {{BATSMAN}} has flicked it away through backward square leg. {{TEAM}} nearing 200!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full at the pads, {{BATSMAN}} gets his bat down from the big back-lift and flicks it stylishly behind square. Beats the fielder's dive in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, almost an action replay of the previous shot, gets down low to a well flighted delivery and sweeps it in front of square on the on-side, the fielder at square dives to his left and can't stop it, ends the powerplay in style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh gosh! That was vintage {{BATSMAN}}. Full delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} does not bother to get his front leg behind the line, short-arm jabs the loft over the bowler's head, one bounce and over the ad hoardings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely batting from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} gets slightly short, and he pounces on it. Right back in the crease, waits for the ball and dabs it past slip. {{BOWLER}} livid with himself, swings his hand wildly in frustration\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's well done. {{BATSMAN}} walked across, expecting {{BOWLER}} to keep it straight and quick. He got inside the line of the ball and then swept it powerfully past short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ho ho ho!! That was creamed away. Length ball, dangling away and the batsman eases the cover drive away into the gap. The ball speeds away into the fence. Again the ball curved away but the neat footwork towards the line of the ball ensured the batsman had it covered. Action-packed start\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, street-smart cricket. Saw third man was inside the ring, just opens the bat face and runs it fine of him. Lovely\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shuffles across, bends on one knee and gets the sweep away fine. Races away once it beats the man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh that's another stunner from {{BATSMAN}}. Shuffled across and timed his pick-up scoop just right. Not easy if that's almost a yorker from {{BOWLER}}. Perhaps an inch short but how good was {{BATSMAN}}, laying into it like it's a right he's earned\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and effective! {{BATSMAN}} anticipated where {{BOWLER}} would bowl and moved across the crease well before the ball was released. Uses the pace on this delivery and laps it over short fine leg. A couple of bounces into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is away and how! He is fearless and he flaunted that there. It was on a length and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, makes room and thumps it wide of cover for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} skips down and does well with the loft. Did not appear to have given it everything. The focus was on the timing after he met the pitch of the ball. Lifted it pretty straight and fetched a four to the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a shot. Lets the ball shape away and then goes back to punch through cover. Found the gap with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! Short and turning in, {{BATSMAN}} goes with all his might on the cut, the ball takes the top-edge and flies away fine. No chance for Yusuf to haul that in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's the ruin. All the width put out for {{BATSMAN}} to get .. and he chases, carving it over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ah, stunning. {{BOWLER}} looks to bang it in short, but {{BATSMAN}}'s standing taller, with a lofted pull, over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too much width and {{BATSMAN}} punishes him. The back-spinner, {{BATSMAN}} crouches and lifts it inside out over cover for a boundary. That's Raina-esque\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, insi{{BATSMAN}} edge past the sticks. It's always dangerous playing a horizontal shot to an inswinging {{BATSMAN}}livery, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to cut, luckily it missed the poles and beat fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant placement! There is a long-on in place but {{BATSMAN}} had got this well wide of that fielder who had no chance to cut it off. Bad ball from {{BOWLER}} though, too short and allowed {{BATSMAN}} to sit back on the pull. He cleverly picked his spot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, on the charge, converts the length into his arc and on-tonks. Not the legs, but nobody's cutting this off with nobody in the vicinity of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a response. Flays this through backward point. And it's not all that short either. But the width is there from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} jumps all over it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} seems like he's picking him. Or maybe it's just premeditated. Backs away to a length ball, it turns away from him and he cuts through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gee, this man. It's not short, it's just wide. And seams in a touch to cut the room, but the hands that {{BATSMAN}} has. Cuts it up and over covers. No feet, all hands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stand and deliver. {{BOWLER}} helped him with the perfect length, {{BATSMAN}} cleared his front leg and thumped it straight back over {{BOWLER}}. He didn't even bother to run\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} hitting through the off-side tells you he is in form. Short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} makes his own room and slaps it through the crowded off-side field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, lovely shot from {{BATSMAN}}, he's looking in good touch already. A no-ball as well as {{BOWLER}} flicked the bails during his delivery stride. Turns out to be a low full-toss, {{BATSMAN}} presents a straight bat and punches it back past the non-striker\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a mistimed pull, but four. Over square leg. The length wasn't there for the shot, but {{BATSMAN}} muscled that, got it off the splice of the bat but managed to clear the square leg umpire\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky and four, fuller length {{BATSMAN}}livery and well wi{{BATSMAN}} of off, AB saw the width and threw his hands at that, gets a thick insi{{BATSMAN}} edge that races past the off-stump\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss, trying for a yorker but gets it wrong. That was 120kph! The batsman though stays calm, maintains his shape and open-faces the ball over cover for a four. The deep cover was too straight. Three men were around the point region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clubbed, made a great noise as the bat connected with the ball. Length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and heaves it over wide mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short, nothing in terms of pace, everything in terms of width. And {{BATSMAN}} makes it worse with him backing away, throws his hands out, gets a fat edge. And a vacant cordon is enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and he's away in a flash. Shortish and just outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and cuts fiercely through cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drifts it in on leg, it's half-edged, half-deliberate. {{BATSMAN}} played slightly outside the line expecting the ball to turn a bit too more but it skids on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, makes room, creates the room for himself and smashes it wide of mid-off for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hard pull, straight to deep mid-wicket. Yea, simple, single. But no, Gill messes up, bending low a little too casually and letting the ball slip through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and powers it fine of fine leg for a boundary. Good connection!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}, he's looking in good form tonight. Short and on the stumps, he gets inside the line and helps it on its way, one bounce and over the fence at backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off the mark with a boundary! Scored a fifty in the last match too. Plants his front foot forward and creams the legbreak through the gap at covers. The outfield is quick enough to get him off the mark with four runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, errs on the other side now. Too much width outside off, {{BATSMAN}} adjusts his bat angle to smack it in the gap between backward point and short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets a boundary but the bowler won the mini battle there, the batsman stepped out, was the googly, {{BATSMAN}} went through with the swing, mistimed it but managed to place it to the right of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, down on one knee and he goes boom on the sweep. Gets inside the line and picks his gap through backward square, timed well too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, that's a horror delivery. Did that slip out of his hand? That should have been the case. A very high full toss on leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and swings his bat hard. Gets it fine of the fine leg fielder. No ball signalled\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary for Steve {{BATSMAN}} this IPL. He will be a relieved man. Gets across and hammers the length ball over mid-wicket with sheer power\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a shot that should make him feel better. {{BOWLER}} errs in his length slight and that is enough for {{BATSMAN}} to punish him, driven beautifully wide of mid-off and the ball raced away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, leg-break, but down the wrong line, and a tad short, {{BATSMAN}} gets back and helps it on its way with a pull to backward square leg for four. Easy picking for a man in form.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 21st IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}, and his first against RR. A pacy low full toss, {{BATSMAN}} uses the bowler's pace to drive it through the gap between backward point and short third man. The placement was spot on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ah, ugly. Really, really bad-looking. {{BATSMAN}} - desperate to breach this pressure he's put on himself - runs down the pitch, hoicks big, hoping to go somewhere over cow corner, but only ends up with a thick leading edge, just past Watson leaping up at slip and managing to trickle under Bravo's diving attempts in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower delivery combined with width, {{BATSMAN}} flays it behind point and bisected the fielders expertly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark and so is {{TEAM}}, that too in style. Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} punches it hard towards cover and a misfield by Samson results in a boundary. He has scored 91* but can't take fielding lightly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ala laser beam. Ues his feet and drills that straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superbly played! Trifle short and {{BATSMAN}} was quick to go on the back foot and pounce on it. Waited for the ball and scythed it through backward point. The man in the deep gives a chase, but to no avail\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rather than using a horizontal bat this time, he just steers this past short third man and into the boundary. It was a slower ball from {{BOWLER}} so wasn't a lot of pace to work with. But the timing is exquisite from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is finally getting a move on. He must have faced million balls of {{BOWLER}} in the nets and that experience comes to his advantage. He comes on the front foot and drives it wide of mid-off, it races along the carpet for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is superb batting! He's toying with the field, {{BATSMAN}}. Makes a bit of room to the loopy off break and goes with the turn on this chip over extra cover. Another clean connection and the boundaries continue to rain here in Hyderabad\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's timed that well. Gets on top of the bounce, opens the bat face nicely and steers it past point. No chance for the third man fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is underway! {{BOWLER}} fires it in full on middle, {{BATSMAN}} drills it down the ground. The umpire has to duck under it to evade that. The ball races away into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Ayappa has misjudged it horribly. Short of length and {{BATSMAN}} pulls it to deep mid-wicket, Ayappa is late to charge in and then has to run back because the ball bounced in front of him, can only parry it over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, tad too short from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, rolls his wrists and finds the gap between the two men in the deep, much needed boundary for the Mumbai Indians\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, poor delivery to start with. {{BATSMAN}} might not have got any bat on this length delivery down leg, but there is a big deflection off the pad to beat a diving Philippe\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes funky. And gets edgy. Another usual walk across and then a sit to sweep, but the inside half of the bat gets it fine, really fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another costly death over for RCB, 18 off it. The off-pace short of length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} spotted it early, shuffled across to get inside the line and pulled it over short fine, once it cleared the fielder there was no stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully timed! {{BATSMAN}} is away with a sublime stroke. Half volley on the pads, he latches onto it with a wristy flick that's placed quite wide of the fine leg fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, check for a spark on the bat! Wow that was hit hard! Hard is an understatement of the highest order. It was a yorker on the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} was standing deep in the crease, he gets under it and pumps it straight down the ground. It rockets to the fence!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a gimme on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and helps it away to the fine leg fence, {{BOWLER}}'s pace takes care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, a floaty half-volley from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, closes the face of the bat and drives it back past the non-striker, no chance for the man at mid-off\n",
            "San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, FIFTY for the combo! This man can do anything and everything with the willow. The pied piper of {{TEAM}} treated the bowler as if he hails from Hamelin. That was full outsi{{BATSMAN}} off and the batsman just steered the ball over the man at point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, might have been the slower one and {{BATSMAN}} picked the bones out of that one. He cleared his front leg to give him more options and then slots the loft over mid-on, one bounce and over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, more of the AB we know and love of the past - back of a length and just outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, not a bad ball by any means, AB comes down the track, makes room and cracks it square past cover-point - Two men dived, but the ball split them expertly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a low full toss. {{BOWLER}} well and truly on his way to some unwanted bowling figures tonight. {{BATSMAN}} meanwhile just about clears his front leg and slices it past a tired extra cover at the fence. Spare a thought\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} proving to be expensive in his first game of the season. Goes full on off and {{BATSMAN}} makes the most out of it, smashes it right over the bowler's head for four runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is greeted to the crease with a boundary. Deft from {{BATSMAN}}, waits to the last moment and late cuts it to the third man fence. Almost fetched it from the keeper's gloves\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this boundary brings the 150-run stand between the duo. Harmless length delivery outside off, no mercy whatsoever. {{BATSMAN}} leans across and bashes it over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! Slightly slower - 129.9kph, doesn't bounce much and {{BATSMAN}} is early into his pull shot as he fetches from outside off. Gets a fat inside edge that eludes the leg-stump and runs away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, walks down the track, gets hold of the slower length {{BATSMAN}}livery and pierces the gap between cover and extra cover for a four with a drive on the up. Back-to-back fours\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets inside this short of length delivery and helps the pull over short fine leg. It was really well done because this was a slower ball and there really wasn't a lot of pace to work with\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length, sits up for {{BATSMAN}} who whacks it away through mid-wicket. Dismissive pull shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} drops it short and {{BATSMAN}} stays in his crease and cuts it over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary for the opener has come in the 12th over! {{BATSMAN}} makes room for himself, shimmies down the wicket and lifts the shortish delivery over mid-off. The fielder was inside the circle and all he needed was to clear him, which he does. A sigh of relief for KL\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gift of a delivery for the batsman. Short in length on leg and {{BATSMAN}} pulls it with nonchalance. Beats the fielder at deep backward square leg and adds four more to his tally\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, why should QdK have all the fun? The Mumbai skipper joins in the party now. Waits for the slower delivery deep back in his crease and flicks it over short fine leg. Two fielders converge but none can stop it from reaching the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a rare rank half-tracker, and that's pulled away with all his might to wide long-on for four!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped by Unadkat. He has made a habit of hurting his head this lad. A complete mistimed cross bat swing from Robbie, swirls high and looks to be setting safe into the hands of deep mid-wicket. Unadkat keeps swirling with the ball, lands awkwardly on his back as he bumps his head onto the ground. To make matters worse, it dribbles away to the boundary triangles\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more flight on this ball and {{BATSMAN}} eyes the mid-wicket region. Swings hard and gets a fat outside edge that goes over the slip fielder. Runs away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from {{BOWLER}}, it was short as well. {{BATSMAN}} leans into the free-flowing drive and finds the gap past cover-point, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a sound off the blade! Gee, he just nailed that one, did {{BATSMAN}}. Back of a length and plenty of width outside off, {{BATSMAN}} just leant into it and slap-punched on the up. Gets it past a diving mid-off fielder and it speeds away. Considering the form he has been of late and the way he has played today, he is bound to light this IPL up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, has liberty outside off and he frees his arms. Strokes the cut in the air and over backward point, third man can't get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary of the match, short and angling into Karun's hips, he gets inside the line and tucks it behind square on the on-side. Fine leg was inside the ring and the ball rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, elegance personified! On the pads and {{BATSMAN}} clips it with nonchalance over backward square leg. His best looking shot of the innings so far\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged but safe! So unlucky for the bowler. Bowls a pacy short delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard at it with a pull but a thick top edge eludes the keeper to find the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's good anticipation. Knew {{BOWLER}} will be slow and around off, so shuffles across on his knees and swept this through fine leg. Nicely done\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another full toss, it's {{BATSMAN}} this time and he picks his spot into the deep mid-wicket fence. Not great bowling from {{BOWLER}}. He's missing the yorker by quite a bit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}}-special! Treat for the crowd. It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} takes a good stride forward and leans into it, he times the drive superbly well. It beats the cover and races to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is poor from the youngster. Nah, nah, not where you bowl with fine leg inside the ring. Went for the bouncer, but didn't quite hit his target. {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of it and pulls it over short fine leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR. No sighters. Walk in and get a boundary. As simple as that. Slog-sweeps from outside off and boy! The ball flies away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, errs in line after a good start. This is a shortish one on leg and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out on the chance. Swivels and drags it down to the fine leg fence, can't keep a fielder there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, geee, that was hit hard. Fuller ball just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and slugs that over mid-on to the long-on fence for four. Lands just short of the rope. Odd how the top-edge carried and this didn't :O\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fraction short and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to make {{BOWLER}} pay, he goes back and punches it square on the off-side, he used the pace of {{BOWLER}} to beat the fielder at point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and now gets inside the line of this and helps the pull wide of short fine. Back to back boundaries and what was looking like a good over has been spoiled\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} tries the slower ball bouncer, {{BATSMAN}} does well to roll his wrists and control the hook shot, sends it past short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the runs keep flowing. The 100 is up for {{TEAM}}. The equation is down to a run-a-ball. This should be a cake walk. Banged in halfway down the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} swats the pull over mid-wicket. He had to really reach out and did well to avoid the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh that is laced! Backs away into the on-side, picks up the length ball on off-stump, and absolutely flays that over the in-field to the deep extra cover fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first runs off the bat from {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}}. It was on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets in the position quickly and whips it wide of the fine leg fielder for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finds the gap again. He has taken a liking to Bhajji. It was full and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} plunges forward and creams it wide of cover. The placement was good as it beats the deep cover fielder into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four. {{BATSMAN}} won't mind that. Quicker and the ball straightens a touch, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard on the drive and the outside edge runs away fine. A welcome boundary for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bad misjudgement from Rajpoot in the deep. He lets this bounce in front of him and then weakly stretches out his hand, only to parry it over the ropes. Carrom ball on leg-stump from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} stood still and swiped it through square leg. Good contact\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 19 off the over.. That's the big one Mumbai wanted. {{BOWLER}} goes for the slower back of a length stuff, {{BATSMAN}} walks across, gets inside the line and laps it over short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Harbhajan Singh misfields! This is contagious. First Jadeja, now Bhajji. MS Dhoni would be livid with this. Was a full length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went for a drive and got an outside edge towards third man where a misfield helped him with a boundary. {{BATSMAN}} will be thanking CSK fielders for their generosity tonight\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this shot will get the Delhi crowd going! It was on a back of a length and was attacking the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} moves to the off-side a touch, clears leg-side for himself and tonks it over short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stylish from Mayank {{BATSMAN}}, whipping a length ball round his front pad. Nice bent front knee there, as he picked it away from off stump to the long leg boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pitched up this time with a bit of away swing. {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, and stays just as elegant -- drilling this cover drive with a louder crunch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50 up for Delhi and it has come at the rate of knots. {{BOWLER}} serves another overcooked delivery and the Delhi skipper plays an exquisite on-drive. Mid-on is no where close to cut this down, beautiful shot!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now conventional. But keeps thudding the fence. Forces it full, forces it wide and amplified further with {{BATSMAN}} backing away and smacking the drice off a knee. Sliced over a leaping Ishant at short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the dart again. But this time {{BATSMAN}} takes matters all along the turf. Making it look all the more elegant. Clears his front leg and whips it powerfully through mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, right where {{BATSMAN}} likes it. Wide of off-stump, he uses his wrist power to smash a drive wide of extra cover. High elbow and all that...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, genuinely squared up outside edge -- but {{BATSMAN}} manages to keep some control and drop his wrists to guide it past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball at the sticks and the batsman slashes the ball away across the line and threads it between long-on and deep mid-wicket. Fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! Another valuable knock from the run-machine from Punjab\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 10 off first two. fabulous shot. Sets up a solid base, extends his arms and lifts it over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good batting from {{BATSMAN}}. A no risk shot this. Waited for the ball to arrive, used whatever pace was available and steered it fine, Badree had no chance at short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide, it's met with a punishing slap over extra cover. Deserved the treatment it got, really poor delivery\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length delivery just outside off, straightening a little, and taking the leading edge of the closed bat-face to deep backward point. It was in the air for a while, but through the vacant region for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 149.8km/h, but it's a half-volley on the pads - wasted pace. Just an effortless whip to the backward square leg fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a slog. But he has managed to elude mid-wicket leaping. Dragged the flighted delivery from outside off and even though it came off the thickish inside half, it was enough to beat Rohit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets off the mark in style! A 132.7kph length ball, {{BATSMAN}} walks forward and across, closes his bat-face and clips it through the mid-wicket region. The fielder on the on-side got a hand to it, but the outfield is swift here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, takes on the tease, takes on the invite and gets himself a pressure releiving boundary. Clears his front leg, steps aside as well in the process and goes inside-out with his lofted drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too predictable. The slower ones, I meant. This was on shortish length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} deals it with alacrity, fetches the pull from outside off and nails it in front of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ah, you don't nail yorkers better -- 144kph on the base of off. {{BATSMAN}} desperately jams his bat down, somehow getting an inside tickle past his stumps, and there's nothing fine leg's running dive can do to stop it either\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, \"catch it\" shouted Bairstow but it was nowhere close to the fielder. The wrong 'un is leg-lined, {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knee and nails the sweep over the square leg umpire, no chance for the long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no... he doesn't! How often have we seen the last delivery of the over to be the spoiler! Darts it on leg and {{BATSMAN}} gets down on his knee to paddle it away and a chase by the fielder is not enough to stop this as the ball races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slightly straighter from {{BOWLER}} and the batsman clips the ball away between mid-wicket and mid-on for a four. Hardly touched it and the ball sped away after he shuffled a tad across his sticks\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picked away into the leg-side again. {{BOWLER}} searching for swing, pitching it right up, but the ball goes on with the angle and ends up on the pads. He has to adjust his line. Too many freebies\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slapped! In trying to shorten the length Krishna offers width outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and cracks the cut square on the off-side, raced away quickly beating sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the edges too come in. Ah, unfair. {{BOWLER}} bumps it in, gets it at the perfect nagging height and {{BATSMAN}}'s compulsive pull gets the top edge flying over the keeper. You cannot stop these\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this won't help. This won't help Punjab at all. Swept straight to Shami at short fine leg, but he doesn't even get a hand on it. Right through the legs.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, \"that's terrible, I am sorry,\" says Bishop on air. Another full slower delivery from {{BOWLER}}. He's not giving up on the plan. And {{BATSMAN}}, not for the first time this over, creams the drive past the diving mid-off fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower one, off-cutter on a good length, not much deviation, and {{BATSMAN}} bottom-hand-lofts it through the line to long-off for a one-drop four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} delayed the cut shot as the ball came slowly, hit that really hard through cover-point. He wants to make the most of the new ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first one of the innings for {{BATSMAN}}. He has joined the skipper now. Flatter in trajectory and outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out on it and slaps it through the gap at covers, he needs to play along with Kohli if {{TEAM}} want to make a match out of it. Can't be chased alone this target\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's in the slot, it's in {{BATSMAN}}'s arc, and he makes sure he plonks in front and smokes this downtown, and makes sure he makes it look seriously brutal\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, tossed up well outside off, Mayank bent down low, used the pace on the ball and lapped it fine, fine leg is very square and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, round the wicket and dishes in a full toss, the idea was to nail the yorker, missed and {{BATSMAN}} slices it over the infield on the off-side. The fielder was at deep cover and even though the ball plugged in the outfield, he couldn't get there\n",
            "{{BATSMAN}} {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clean strike! Width on offer on this length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} chips it over wide mid-off. Clears the infield comfortably and gets his second boundary of the match\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is class from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} corrects his line but still goes for four as {{BATSMAN}} waits for it longer and steers it past point. Third man had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tossed up outside leg, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to play the sweep, gets a fat top-edge, fine leg was inside the ring and the ball lobs him, into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, outside edgeeee but safe! {{BATSMAN}} really throws his hands at this length delivery wide outside off stump, wanted a drive through cover, got a thick edge that went wide of slip and beat third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is struggling with his line. Left-right combination is making it much difficult for him to stick to one line. Now he slips onw down the legs of {{BATSMAN}}, who helps it down to fine leg with a flick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now these two boundaries have made a mess of {{BOWLER}}'s figures. The length was shortened by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} danced out of his crease and slapped it through covers. In the gap and 13 came off that over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, plenty of flight on that one and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it. Watches it closely and nails the drive wide of extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh my word! He's hammered it past mid-off. What a hit. {{BOWLER}} went quicker and fired it outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and drills it with ferocity down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh that's a timely hit! Slower ball on the shorter side, {{BATSMAN}} made room, lost balance but managed to cut that nicely over cover-point and there's no protection in the deep. 12 off the over, 55 more needed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full in length by Narina and {{BATSMAN}} hacks it into the gap at deep mid-wicket. The ball is just sailing all over the park, the fielders are going to have a neck-ache by the end of this innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, uff! How did {{BATSMAN}} manage to get some bat on this? A fast low full toss, {{BATSMAN}} gives everything at it and it brushes the inside edge, beats the man at short fine leg. Had he missed it, he would've caught plumb in front. KXIP knew how close it was.. sigh!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slashed through the covers .. and Chahar, chasing it from sweeper just doesn't put in the dive, merely sticking his foot out. Oh dear ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now Rohit is angry. Must be at {{BOWLER}}. He brought the third man up and {{BOWLER}} hasn't bowled to his field. A slower {{BATSMAN}}livery outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} plays it late and directs it in the gap between backward point and short third. That's three fours in the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's delicious. More air on this ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out with a stride and gets to the pitch of the ball. Follows it up with a superb drive through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky and four, on a good length and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} heaves across the line, gets a thick inside edge past square leg. The pace of this outfield is so good that it rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, inside-out over covers. Perhaps only Raina matches him there. Reads the flight early, drags himself inside the line and then goes over covers. Boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a bit of flight and {{BATSMAN}} goes through the line. Weight on front foot and boom, it's flying over straightitsh long-on already\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 19 runs off the over. An expensive one for KKR. A short ball that sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}}, he spindles across and pulls it behind square. Goes all the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, up and over! Might have been the slower ball from {{BOWLER}} but it's was quite wide and that allowed {{BATSMAN}} to extend his arms. Didn't connect the loft perfectly but had enough to clear the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is so unlike {{BOWLER}}. He hasn't looked himself tonight. Another drag-down, {{BATSMAN}} controls the pull and beats Mavi to his left at deep mid. 10 off that over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just clears mid-on! Was a miscued lofted flick from {{BATSMAN}} who saw the length full and tried his luck. Wasn't off the middle of the blade, yet managed to get it past the leaping fielder in the circle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's some way to welcome {{BOWLER}} to the crease, length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and drills it through the line, one bounce and over the ropes at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, across his stumps and way she goes into the fine leg fence. Sweetly timed, {{BOWLER}} has no clue. {{BATSMAN}} walked a long way across and helped the full delivery with a real tap of the bat. Flew!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, last over of the powerplay and {{BATSMAN}} has decided to cash in. Advances and gets cramped for room, swings with all his might and drags it off the inner part of the bat to the left of short fine, Dinda can only escort the ball to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 16 runs off the opening over. Couldn't have asked for a better start. On the pads again and all {{BATSMAN}} does is clips it past the fielder at short fine leg, he dives there but the ball is too quick for him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} dropped this one short and on the leg-stump line, pulled away hard and past square leg, beats the fielder getting across from the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's the french cut. Short of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes at it with hard hands, pulls and ends up getting an inside edge. Past the off-stump and runs down to the fine leg boundary. Was very close to knocking down the off-pole\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full, down leg. Nothing right with that. Certainly not if fine leg is inside. Certainly not if that man is Chris Gayle. All {{BATSMAN}} has to do is get the bat down in giving it some tickle. And places it wide and into the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, class! Returning to the IPL after a couple of years but it seems he never left. Premeditates and puts this one away to the third man fence with a fine reverse sweep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, welcome into the attack Mr. {{BOWLER}}! A short legbreak with width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} eyes lit up on seeing that and he chops it through the gap at point and short third man, sublime\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a brilliant stroke! {{BOWLER}} can't believe that. He didn't do much wrong there. It was bowled in the blockhole wide of off and {{BATSMAN}} opens his bat face and drills the squeeze wide of point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 120.7kph, goes airy. {{BOWLER}} feeds length, and {{BATSMAN}} goes full-hearted, committing to slicing this easily over mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, fraction short and just outside off, the leg-break from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and dabs it past KW at first slip, rolls away to the fence in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good way to start the over. Shade too straight from {{BOWLER}}, on off and middle, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and whips it backward of square leg. He ensured that he got it past the man at short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes with the spin and gives it a full whack. Quick to rock back, pulls as hard as he can, Mandeep Singh from long-on does well to make a diving stop, but he seems to have made contact with the boundary triangles, the boot to be precise\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more runs! A wild slog this time from {{BATSMAN}} who picked the googly but got it off the inside half of the blade. Still had enough on it to find the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 142.9km/h, back of a length delivery angling into the hips, tucked away with fabulous timing towards the cow corner fence for four. Harshal Patel's valiant effort at the boundary in vain...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, elegant shot! The flourish of the bat was a sight to behold. Knuckle ball from {{BOWLER}} but too full and also too straight as well, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles a touch to flick it away sweetly. Bisected mid-on and mid-wicket with ease. Yusuf gave a chase but was never going to stop it even with the slide\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sits on one knee and chips the slog-sweep over mid-wicket, excellent batting this from GG\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped by Rohit! Sharp chance but he didn't time the leap well, ended up getting a hand and it dribbled away down to the long-off fence. Was in the slot as {{BATSMAN}} went for the loft down the ground. Didn't get it off the middle and if not for Rohit's lapse in fielding, the {{TEAM}} skipper might have been on his way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more. This is brilliant batting. Without any risk too. That's 16 runs off the over. The last two balls have been short, even though this bounced from a back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} was back and across, cuts again and does so well, to find the gap between point and cover-point. An injection of momentum, so badly needed by {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sprays it down leg. {{BATSMAN}}'s quick to latch on, swivelling, swiping flat and hammering it fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, again {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker and {{BATSMAN}} shows his wizardry. Gets {{BATSMAN}}ep, opens the bat face and pile drives the ball past cover for a four. Superb from Mr. 360\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much needed for Delhi. The crowd find their voice with this boundary. {{BOWLER}} bangs it in short and at his pace on this surface it sat up, {{BATSMAN}} thumps the pull over mid-wicket and the ball raced away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another edge, another boundary! Was a full length delivery angled away from the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} went hard at it, swung at it and got a thick outside edge that flew over gully this time. Hit out or get out, this is the only one way {{BATSMAN}} knows\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, width to {{BATSMAN}}? Really? Is that a deathwish? It was short, plenty of width outside off. {{BATSMAN}} reaches for it and slaps it up and over point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, leg-stump half-volley from Shardul, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, leans into the on-drive and finds the gap wide of mid-wicket - should get plenty of confidence with that blow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 24th IPL fifty for Robin {{BATSMAN}}! Gets there with a boundary, perhaps the easiest ball faced in his entire IPL career. A full ball slanting down leg, {{BATSMAN}} just needed to meet that and meet that he did. Clean and quick into the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off-break. {{BATSMAN}} too continues staying on the back foot, whipping it with a lot more intent, under short mid-wicket's dive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smacks the ball and flexes his muscles. Doesn't move. Whoa, how's that for a confidence! Slightly fuller and wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} cracks it straight past mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the boundary that they will need in every over from now has come. Was a bit short, {{BATSMAN}} went back and thrashed past the man at cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a gift and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it. What was that from {{BOWLER}}? Darts a full toss on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} won't miss out on those. Bends his back leg and clouts it behind square leg. There's none to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back fours. {{BOWLER}} doles out a full toss. There's the customary shuffle from {{BATSMAN}} and then he glances it neatly through square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 142.9km/h, short and marginally wide, {{BATSMAN}} can just hang back and carves that away to the deep backward point fence for four!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, KXIP - 2, {{TEAM}} - 0 this season! A comfortable victory for the home team, win by 12 runs. {{BATSMAN}} sliced the full ball one-handed and managed to get it over extra cover, Mayank Agarwal chases the ball to his left but he couldn't arrest him momentum and ended up sliding over the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pulled away! Shortish on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} goes back in the crease to pull it past deep square leg. Striking at a rate of over 200 at the moment\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misses the yorker and it is a juicy full toss just below waist, {{BATSMAN}} picked his spot and it is deep mid-wicket. Not the best of connections and hence he picks up only a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, awful start from {{BOWLER}}, fine leg was inside the ring and he looks to bounce out {{BATSMAN}}. There's not much bounce on this one, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across and helps it over short fine-leg, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundary to end the over. It didn't come off the middle of the bat, but {{BATSMAN}} won't mind. It was a short ball from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} is slightly late on his pull and gets it off the top part of the bat. Finds the gap in the deep mid-wicket area\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, a gentle loosener from {{BOWLER}}, half-volley on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he gets inside the line, brings his wrists into play and flicks it past square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not where he intended but it's a welcome boundary for Kings XI. Just been a bit of a lull after Gayle's dismissal. Length ball angling away outside off, throws his bat at it and carves it off a thick outside edge between short third and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} had some extra time to adjust as it was around the 130ks, he arches back and ramps it over non-existent short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air and just short of Hardik at mid-off. {{BOWLER}} stays round the wicket, the cross-seamer outside off, {{BATSMAN}} checks his drive and the ball lobs towards mid-off, dips in front of Hardik and runs away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drifts into the pads, and with fine leg up, that's asking for punishment. {{BATSMAN}} duly puts him away to the boundary. Good wristwork\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, feeds the pads. {{BATSMAN}} gets on his toes, shuffling inside the line and whippy hands in flicking it in front of square. The class .. sheer tons of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor poor effort from Uthappa. What an error from the vice captain of KKR. Flat and quick outside off, {{BATSMAN}} punches it from the crease towards Uthappa at cover-point, who clumsily lets it through. {{BOWLER}} is not happy with the effort\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 144.5kph. Slight width, wth Faf backing away to snatch a lot more to slap this with lots of bottom-hand, past Rohit's dive at short cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off the mark with a boundary. That's not enough though. Needs a few more of them and get going. Picks the length early on this short one and pulls it in front of deep square leg who's too square in order to cut it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hoho, fierce! Absolutely fierce from {{BATSMAN}}. He's just showed {{BOWLER}} who's the boss. He gives charge, and accordingly {{BOWLER}} bangs it in short. But {{BATSMAN}} isn't backing down. He thumps the ball wide of long-on into the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, impeccable timing behind this cover drive, and even Faf du Plessis can do nothing about it. Touch fuller outside off and it has been absolutely creamed through the huge gap on the off side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunched away! Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands at it and crunches it through the gap at cover-point, races away to the fence in a jiffy. How good has he looked in his maiden IPL season!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, don't worry about that! Healthy width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink and gets his christmas gift\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, high quality shot! Why move around the in the crease and swipe when you can play shots like this. This was full and quite wide as well, {{BATSMAN}} played the square drive late to bisect short third man and backward point with precision. Top stuff!!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, fraction short and just outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, AB arches back and then ramps over third man, couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, with mid-off up, you don't bowl full. That's exactly what {{BOWLER}} did and got punished. {{BATSMAN}} drills the drive wide of a diving mid-off fielder. 21 off the over and DD need just 23 with three overs to go\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky from ABD! The reverse paddle and it's actually risky with a slip in place but the South African connects fairly well. Well wi{{BATSMAN}} of backward point to get a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}! This was speared down the leg side by {{BOWLER}} and the skipper flicks it past the man at short fine leg with nonchalance. 9000 runs in T20 cricket for {{BATSMAN}}, informs Sunny G on air..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sliced with one hand, full and outside off stump, pace off, so {{BATSMAN}} was deceived but he went through with the loft, clears short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} likes the short stuff, he likes pace too. No wonder he's from Brisbane. Rocks a touch back and then smashes the pull through mid-wicket, raced away...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's carrying on from where he right off in Hyderabad. DC are helping him by offering pace too. {{BOWLER}} bangs this short and that's right down {{BATSMAN}}'s ally. Forehand pull pumped away to the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft touch! If the previous shot showcased his power, this is all about finesse. Slower and around off, not all that short but {{BATSMAN}} waits for it on the back foot before essaying the late cut. Gets it very fine and just past the keeper as it races to the fence. He is in the zone, is {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} missed his length by a couple of yards and that's all waht {{BATSMAN}} needed to get going. Back of a length and well outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} cuts, beats backward point and look at him, he's fired up. Cheers himself up with a soft of fist pump, he didn't like being dominated/threatened by {{BOWLER}} for those three deliveries\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Delhi have decided to go after RCB's best bowler. Leg-stump line, {{BATSMAN}} crouches and slog-sweeps it over backward square leg for a one-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, both of them have just played themselves in such good form here. Full ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and crashes it inside-out to send it to the wide long-off fence. Superb hand-eye co-ordination\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and put away behind square with disdain. Nothing delivery from {{BOWLER}}, can't drop at this length, especially at his pace. Sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}}, who takes full toll of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lots of width from Sran and {{BATSMAN}} lashes him over cover-point. He had no intentions of keeping it along the ground, which is the way to go when you're going hard at it. Even if an edge is found, it will fly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, sprays it down leg, {{BATSMAN}} can't meet with the tickle, but the ball brushes the pad to beat Pant to his left. Poor ball that from {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shoddy from Piyush Chawla, running around from fine leg. He's too stiff while bending and the ball slips underneath him. Swinging in on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} clips it behind square leg and it shouldn't have been more than a couple\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half-volley outside off, {{BATSMAN}}'s back lift is so high that it allows him to cream those drives through extra cover. Advantage {{BATSMAN}} when you bowl full. Timed and placed to perfection...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another loosener down the leg side and it's been hacked through square leg by {{BATSMAN}}. Clears the infield convincingly for four more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this one does not swing. And hence there is no exaggerated shuffle from {{BATSMAN}}. Stands his ground and flays the drive through cover. Races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slightly overpitched and {{BATSMAN}} puts it away! He gets low and slog sweeps it behind square leg. What an excellent shot to get off the mark\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that was in the air, but in the gap too. Ends the powerplay with a boundary, does {{BATSMAN}}. Was short and wide outside off and {{BATSMAN}} placed his square cut right into the gap between point and cover-point. End of a fruitful powerplay for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the width is back. And so is the allied length that starts off from half way down. A wristy chop quite off the outside half of the bat. Hurries away through third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finds the gap this time. Not a lot wrong with this delivery, it was a slower one and was on the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} picks it up early, swivels and pulls it wide of fine leg for a boundray. Sweet connection! First boundary for MS in this innings, this might get him going!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's welcomed into the attack with a boundary. Went fuller just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard and sort of squirted it off the inner half, miscued it airly and it flies past Rabada's dive at mid-on. No point chasing it as it scurries away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short googly outside off, really ordinary stuff, and {{BATSMAN}} isn't in the mood to let them get away. Smashes the pull wide of deep midwicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, into his 90s is {{BATSMAN}}! Full in length outside off and {{BATSMAN}} chips it over covers for four more. Amazing display of batting by {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, Mumbai are alive! They live on to fight another day this season. An anti-climax of a finish, slow yorker and {{BATSMAN}} missed the slog to be hit on the back leg. KXIP were busy appealing for LBW and the ball raced away to the fence. They didn't have any review to challenge the call anyway and so it meant that the game was settled\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very, very poor effort from Tye. Too lazy to bend down and {{BOWLER}} is not happy at all. Slashed wide of long-off, Tye moves across to his left, went with one-hand pretty late and ends up letting it roll away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, they're racing through. Brings up the half-ton stand as well. Watto decides to get defensive with a wide dart. Not quite the case with {{BATSMAN}} already stooping low and reaching out in drilling it behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes through KW's hands at first slip! Is this the game for SRH? Massive moment in the game. {{BATSMAN}} plays this leg break off the back foot and ends up edging it straight to his opposition counterpart. Williamson didn't expect it to come so quickly perhaps and it went through him to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, quicker slider in the slot, and {{BATSMAN}}'s already taken his front leg out of the way to drill it uppishly down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, takes his eyes off and pulls a short ball. Top-edge flies over the keeper's head, all these runs count\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one bounce and over the ropes! {{BATSMAN}} picks the length early, swivels and bullies the pull shot over square leg umpire, fine leg had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, I have no idea how {{BATSMAN}} has cut this all the way towards widish third man. Short ball yes, but looked like {{BATSMAN}} was slightly late on the shot, but he actually middled it, just fell an inch inside the rope, poor start to the over for RCB\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is excellent from {{BATSMAN}}. He is giving the treatment to the young man. There was just a little bit of width on this delivery, {{BATSMAN}} opens the face of the bat at the very last moment, made brilliant use of his wrists and guides it wide of backward point for another four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor bowling by {{BOWLER}}! Bowls this one on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} sweeps it through fine leg, ends the over with 10 runs of two deliveries\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clobbered away! This time, {{BATSMAN}} connected the pull perfectly and it raced away. Short of a length around middle, not high enough to threaten the batsman and an in-form batsman like {{BATSMAN}} isn't going to miss out. Sends this to the deep square leg fence. {{BOWLER}} needs to recover quickly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss. {{BATSMAN}}'s cleared out his front leg, laying into it with a fierce cover drive. Bravo - at mid-off - is right there, but he charges at it and his old back is really slow in bending down in time, misfields\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, PHHUUUUFFFFF! Such power. He bulldozes that one through the off-side and the man at cover had no chance as there was a lot of room on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, width available that time, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it to spin and steers it wide of backward point for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and that's a fine start for {{TEAM}}! Fuller delivery and has been on-driven down the ground. The full face of the bat showcased and the ball sped away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50-up for {{TEAM}} with this boundary. {{BATSMAN}} takes on {{BOWLER}}, uses his feet and reaches the pitch. Lets his bottom hand do the talking. Lofting him over {{BOWLER}}'s head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is riding his luck. Slightly up outside off, this one seams away from the batsman who flays at it and gets an outside edge that flies over short third man. Fleming's reaction in the balcony depicts how desperate CSK are for a win..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not a kind of shot that you would associate with {{BATSMAN}}. Gets a length ball and just clears his legs to club this over mid-wicket. An agricultural hoick of sorts and it's come off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is a thick edge but it will do for {{BATSMAN}}. Backs away and slashes the short of length {{BATSMAN}}livery, gets enough bat on that to clear backward point and short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is underway! Typical {{BATSMAN}}. Shortish ball with width on offer, he'll punish you everytime. Stands tall and slashes it over point. Raced away and there's pin drop silence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} shows off his cheekiness. Manufactured room out of nowhere. Pushed through quicker outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went deep and sliced it in the gap between short third man and backward point. Threaded the gap beautifully\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good effort by Morris, but in vain. {{BATSMAN}} was down the wicket to chip this widish delivery to long-off. Morris sprints across, gets his hands to it but his knee gets stuck in the turf, hence he fails to stop it cleanly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's been playing so well since he has been promoted. This was played very late by {{BATSMAN}}. Was a quicker delivery outside off, he went back in his crease and guided it sweetly past the man at short third man. No chance of stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, inside edged! Short of a length delivery outside off, seams into the batsman and {{BATSMAN}} gets an inside edge as he flashes hard. Rockets past his stumps and races away to the fine leg fence in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a juicy full toss, with generous width dished out as well. Smoked off the middle of the bat sinking onto the front knee as well making it one for the cameras. Pune need a lot more of these\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overpitched delivery at 124.6kph, {{BATSMAN}} hammers it straight down the ground after walking down the tarck. It went between the umpire and Warner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short, too leg-sided. {{BATSMAN}} swivels inside it and then doesn't hold back on his pull, uppishly, into fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower balls lose their venom when banged in short. Like this time. {{BATSMAN}} has all the time in the world, waits and pulls to the left of the man at deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is underway! That's bread and butter for Gabbar. Too wide and he'll punish you all day. The length was on the shorter side as well - the recipe to get hit. {{BATSMAN}} flashes his bat at it and slaps it through extra cover. Off the mark with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh, it's a harsh game, cricket. An inch-perfect yorker length delivery outside off, angling in, {{BATSMAN}} did try to open the face and run it down, but gets a thin outside edge that just about beats the diving Pooran and runs away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is not a happy man. Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} cuts it over backward point, where the fielder did not make any effort to catch the ball. He might have lost it in the background. Jadeja was the fielder and he simply stood his ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off-cutter, but short, wide (aka long hop). {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands out and carves it behind point. The fielder in the deep tries a sliding tackle, but no, UAE is no football fan\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} overpitches outside off and {{BATSMAN}} drills him through extra cover. That was fiercely struck, went to the boundary in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back fours. It's been raining boundaries in the last few overs. {{BOWLER}} digs it short, sits up emphatically for {{BATSMAN}} as he nails the pull in front of square on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, got to feel for the bowler. Bamboozled {{BATSMAN}} with another googly and {{BATSMAN}} was caught in his crease looking to block. Takes the outside edge and races away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's the second 50-run partnership of the match. Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} beautifully cuts it over point and adds four to his tally\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary conceded by {{BOWLER}}. 121.4kph back of a length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} had the width to work with and he times the pants off this backfoot punch, sweeper was not on the boundary line and he is not able to cut the angle as the ball races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, audacious is the word for this shot. The bowler runs in and bowls a pacy length ball, this lad doesn't move and just opens the face of the bat at the very last moment to beat the diving short third man fielder. He's playing around with the bowlers and the fielders\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is dealing in boundaries at the moment. All his runs have come in fours. Swinging down leg, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it backward of square and beats the fielder in the deep comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misses his length and misses his line too. It ends up being a half-volley on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it wide of fine leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done. Did not try to overhit it. Let the short ball come to him and swiveled well to beat short fine leg's dive to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}}'s so good at playing smart cricket shots and this is one of them. Sees the ball slide down leg and paddles it in a flash past the keeper, played it late but found the middle which is what matters the most\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh my word! What a shot, definitely not a bad ball at all. The end result of this back foot punch was great, but that's not how you should actually be playing. Worked on that occasion, could have been a drag on another day. Inswinger from Bhuvi, {{BATSMAN}} has this strange ability to play off the back foot to ones that aren't actually short, the ball escapes through the gap at cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's raining boundaries! Hint of width on offer outside off and that's sufficient for {{BATSMAN}}, who stays in his crease and carves it over point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball and punished. {{BATSMAN}} picks it up early and nails the pull in front of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, confidence, I tell you is a very big thing in sport. First ball and {{BATSMAN}} has put it away for a boundary. Not a bad delivery - short of length angled at the body, {{BATSMAN}} elevated himself and pulled it past the diving mid-wicket fielder. The timing was spot on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and he drills it better. It's fuller, it's wider, but {{BATSMAN}}'s back on his knee, slapping it much straighter. Yea, there's nobody at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bludgeoned away! Typical brute force from {{BATSMAN}}. He had been trying to break free for a while now and finally, gets one away. Not much room, but he makes some by backing away and smacks it away through the gap at cover. Nobody moved\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, magnificent shot. What a way to get off the mark. Wasn't a bad ball at all. On a back of a length and outside off, with extra bounce too, {{BATSMAN}} plays a top square cut, getting on top of the bounce and hitting the gap wide of cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball, heaved away, no timing but it escapes for four. Another great start from this lovely {{TEAM}} opening pair. Fifty comes up in 5.1 overs. This one was in the air, but wide of the man at mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's tickled that off middle and leg stump. {{BATSMAN}} walks right across, gets a full ball on the pads and just about gets his bat down in time. Would have been plumb had he missed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} opens his account with an elegant flick. {{BOWLER}} goes round the wicket and fires in a full delivery, angled into the left-hander and {{BATSMAN}} whips it past the man at short square leg. Raced away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another quick skidder outside off, sliced away to the third man boundary for four, bringing up another fifty for {{BATSMAN}} as an opener - further accentuating the fact that bringing him in down low was always a bad idea\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crisply struck by {{BATSMAN}}, got forward to this half volley and creamed the drive through extra cover. Pollard in the deep made an attempt but couldn't quite succeed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 93.7kph, quick, short and wide. {{BATSMAN}} takes heavy toll of it. Treks back in his crease and uses the bowler's pace and width to his advantage, Cut fiercely square of the wicket on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, errs in line and {{BATSMAN}} is too good a player to miss out. Drifts onto the pads, {{BATSMAN}} stays on leg-stump and glances it fine. PK at short fine dives just to please the captain, the ball had gone past him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another slower one @112.9km/h, {{BATSMAN}} backs away into the on-side, gives himself some space, and slaps it over the in-field towards the sweeper cover boundary for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, really lucky for {{BATSMAN}}. Pressure was building on him, he makes some room and slices this up off a thick edge over short third man. The idea was to go over backward point, but it spooned up over Bhajji off the edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room for himself and spears the cut between short third man and backward point. Smashing finish for the Kings XI\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and flies over the slips. Doesn't matter how they come but {{BATSMAN}} will take it. Fuller length and seaming away just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard on the downtown swing and gets a thick outside edge which balloons over to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he is picking the gaps to perfection tonight. Covers for the line and lofts gorgeously over extra cover. He is turning it on...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's edged and four! All of a sudden, this has become a different match. We are playing on the same wicket, mind you! It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it to arrive and opens the face of the bat at the very last moment to guide it past third man. No stopping that!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sweet sound on that cracking shot by {{BATSMAN}}. This was pushed through outside off by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} was quick to camp back and slam it to the right of long-off. Beats the man chasing it with utter ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short again. {{BATSMAN}} goes 180-degrees the other way now .. makes room and upper-cuts, over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lucky runs but {{TEAM}} will take them any way they come. Low full toss that {{BATSMAN}} wanted to slug away on the leg-side. Gets an inside edge that just whizzes past leg stump. Too fine and short fine leg had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, two in a row for {{BATSMAN}}. This was streaky but the {{TEAM}} captain won't mind. Pitched up full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went hard on the drive, gets an outside edge that races away to the third man fence. The fielder was squarer and had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, all too easy. {{BOWLER}} doles out a short ball down leg and {{BATSMAN}} just helps it on its way. Pulled away to fine leg for another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully struck! Hint of width from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} lays into the back foot punch, square through the off-side. Finds the gap at point and it scooted away to the fence. Elegant shot!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overpitches and {{BATSMAN}} puts him away. It's a juicy delivery on middle, with {{BOWLER}} perhaps missing a yorker. Nice roll of the wrists from {{BATSMAN}} to flick it through mid-wicket. The man in the deep is too square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sensational stroke! It was fed on the pads, yes, but the execution of the stroke was superb from {{BATSMAN}}. Drop kicks it through backward square leg and a sliding Bumrah from fine leg can't cut it off. Perfect start for {{TEAM}} in this over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, back of a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall, plays with a straight bat and punches, beats point and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and gets this one fine. Shuffled across to a short ball and tucked in the air, but fine leg was not in the ring. Managed to fetch a four in the end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another wild swing and another edge. Looped up and kept third man interested for a while, Yuvi with the dive to his left, but he fails to flick the ball back into play\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drifts on the pads of {{BATSMAN}}, who does not have to do much. Gets on his toes and tickles it into the fine leg fence to get things going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh superb shot. Drifting in on leg stump, and {{BATSMAN}} just whips it over midwicket. It was too full from {{BOWLER}}, and so he was right to the pitch of it. Didn't have to worry about playing against the turn\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} cooking up some great momentum now. Flurry of boundaries. Low full toss from {{BOWLER}} as he misses the wide yorker. {{BATSMAN}} uses the pace and steers it to split short third man and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky and {{BATSMAN}} won't mind. {{BOWLER}} looks down in frustration. Deceived {{BATSMAN}} with a slower delivery and the opener just threw his hands at that, the outside edge evades the outstretched left hand of Pant\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that short-wide combo. And {{BATSMAN}} has no shortage of time on anything. Gets in line, angry bat, angry hands on the revenge from the run-out he's caused. And into deep point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dished wide of off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} frees his arms and clobbers it past backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gee, what placement! Deliberately swung hard at it with an open bat face to send it through point. This was the googly from {{BOWLER}}, making it a risky shot against the incoming ball, but the fact that it was too full made his life easy.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's timed to perfection! Save your legs. It rose just enough from a fullish length, {{BATSMAN}} shows the full face of the bat as he spanks it through cover. No chance for the man in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, \"Catch\" was the cry from {{BOWLER}} but {{BATSMAN}} has placed it just wide of Bumrah at short third man. Shorter outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went for the cut and flashed hard at it. Outside edge flies quickly and rolls through to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh Jonny, you are clearing the fields with mishits too. It was a slower one, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to loft it down the ground, his timing was in a mess. But he gets just about enough bat on it to clear mid-off and it races to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh glorious. In the midst of the madness of wickets tumbling, we have another spanking drive unleashed. Full, wide and carves it away with a square slap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, drives it on the up and beats the diving fielder at cover, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Vijay Shankar isn't donning a helmet. I reckon, he should. Overpitched outside off, {{BATSMAN}} smacks it down the ground. Shankar did well to evade that by ducking under. That went like a bullet\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, too straight from {{BOWLER}}, he hasn't hit his stride as yet - {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and clips it neatly through mid-wicket, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first-ball four for {{BATSMAN}}. Shuffles in the crease, moves miles across the crease and drags the short ball from outside off and manages to get it past the man at short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's no stopping these two. Tossed up {{BATSMAN}}livery around off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches for it with a shimmy and times his chip over long-off, quality shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 143kph sharp bouncer that hurries onto the batsman. {{BATSMAN}} persists with his pull shot and gets a top edge that goes over the short fine leg fielder's head. Unfair for the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 135.7kph. Strays. Feeds the pads, trying out the surprise inswinger after the set up with a couple of away ones, gets it wrong and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to whip, neatly behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot! Dropped short and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to latch onto it, transfered his weight back and pulled it over the mid-wicket fielder, placement was perfect from the skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}} - this is a no-ball for height as well - high full-toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and lifts it over backward point for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, opens the face of the blade on impact and runs it down to third man for a four. Cheeky from {{BATSMAN}} as used the pace of the bowler and knew his angles to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, short of a length and well outside off, the slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, punched off the back-foot and to the right of Shaw at cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} needs a hand on his shoulder. And yes, Bumrah is there. He is your mate, {{BOWLER}}. This is serious hitting from {{BATSMAN}}, it was wide of off and {{BATSMAN}} carves it wide of long-on for another four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! Not where he intended but he won't mind it. Runs down the wicket and swings through the line, the outswinger takes the outside edge and flies over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and another! This is {{BATSMAN}} at his riveting best. Makes a hint of room, gets the shorter length that he expects and slaps it over the infield at backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, throws his bat at a length delivery and gets it past the man at point for a four. {{TEAM}} are running away with the show here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is cutting loose here. Gets under this full ball outside off and thumps it over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brute force from {{BATSMAN}}. Such quicksilver hands. Was a decent delivery as Sran saw {{BATSMAN}} back away to leg and fired it wider of off. But the Australian threw the kitchen sink and managed to stroke it over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, touch short and {{BATSMAN}} makes full use of it. He goes deep in the crease and pulls it to the deep mid-wicket fence for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pumped over mid-off for first IPL runs. It wasn't as close as you want to hear it was. Chipped the loft over Ashwin, who's tall enough. Good use of the length ball and the slight width that {{BATSMAN}} used to use his arms into effect\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too close to cut, but {{BATSMAN}} has played it well! Picked the length early, rocked back and slapped it from around off-stump backwards of point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, is welcomed to the crease with a boundary. Kiwi to Kiwi and {{BATSMAN}} greets him with a flick of his wrists to the fence and brings up his fifty as well. Superbly constructed knock from the {{TEAM}} skipper, waves his bat to the dug-out. His 6th half-century of the season. It was too leg-sidish from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} moved across and wristed it nonchalantly through square leg. In the gap!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, here comes the streak. {{BATSMAN}} gives it his all, just throws his bat out at a short, wide pepper. Only manages a top-edge. More than enough to fly through the cordon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped! Narine got fingertips to it. Floated up around off, {{BATSMAN}} stayed leg-side to play the inside out loft, didn't get the elevation he was looking for and Narine parried it over him. A more agile fielder might have taken it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is riding his luck. Banged in short on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} swivels to pull and ends up gloving it over the keeper. Fine leg is squarer and had no chance there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! {{BOWLER}} bowls length at 140kph, {{BATSMAN}} stays in his crease, slightly clears his front leg and batters it between mid-off and extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a full toss now. {{BATSMAN}} rides his luck with a dish out of some elegant timing. Executes a short arm jab to whip it in the air through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, audacious from {{BATSMAN}}. Changes his stance and employs the reverse-hit. Directs it behind square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} shortens his length seeing {{BATSMAN}} come down. He looks to cut and gets it off the toe end. The ball evades the keeper and runs away into the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, {{BATSMAN}} is playing a fine hand here, short and wide from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, uses the pace on the ball and cuts it behind square on the off-side, beats backward point and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and wide, and the long-limbed {{BATSMAN}} is not going to miss out. Reaches out, with footwork into a snooze, but who cares. It's all hands. Creams the drive through covers. Bullets it. Surgeons it. Whatever. It's {{BATSMAN}}, okay? We're allowed to drool this season\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 134.6kph. Warms up with a rather innocuous back of a length sitter. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't need any further warming up though. He stays up tall, rocking back and flat-bats. Hard. Crunched through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} says thank you and brooms him away into the deep backward square fence. 13 off the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a typical {{BATSMAN}} shot - made room to a good length delivery and then sliced the drive over backward point - didn't get hold of the shot, but has enough to clear the fielders inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't need sighters against his fellow countryman! Fifty for {{BATSMAN}} and he brings it up in style. Tossed up ball, {{BATSMAN}} skips down the pitch and batters it straight down the ground. No chance for the long-off fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery from {{BOWLER}} and gets the punishment. Swinging into the pads of {{BATSMAN}}, who shuffles across and flicks it with supreme timing behind square on the leg-side. There was a fielder in the deep but had no chance of stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, greeted with a dance down the wicket, gets right to the pitch of the flighted delivery and lofts it with the turn over mid-wicket, one bounce and into the fence. He's one of the best players of spin\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misfield by Unadkat and {{BOWLER}} isn't pleased by that. Was a back of a length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went for it with hard hands, threw his bat at it and got an outside edge. Unadkat slips at square third man and misfields as the ball goes through him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short, wide and four, the attempted slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, but it all went wrong - sat up to be smacked, {{BATSMAN}} backed away and then thrashed it over cover for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how good is he! Susses out the plan from {{BOWLER}} based on the line he's been bowling in this over so far, waits on the ball and just slices it past short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another reverse slap. Over short third man this time. Sweetly timed or not, it goes over the fielder and trickles into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} don't look at Maxi. Short and slow outside off. {{BATSMAN}} cuts past backward point and releases the pressure\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball. Short and down leg, too easy for {{BATSMAN}}. Swivels across and helps it on its way past the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! This man, whatta talent. Nothing wrong with the delivery, it was on a length and around off, {{BATSMAN}} jumps in the crease a touch, waits for it to arrive and punches it in the most amazing fashion for a boundary through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, is quick to jummp onto the back foot, gets inside the line of the flatter delivery and thumps it with a clean swing of the willow. A boundary behind square on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky, delicate and effective. Uses the slightest of width on this short ball outside off and sends it wide of the keeper by opening his bat face. It was an off-pace delivery as well. He waited for the ball till the last moment before making contact\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 139.8kph, corrects his overdose of wides with a shorter, but wide one nevertheless. {{BATSMAN}} carves, uppishly, over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Shortish ball that sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} to thwack the pull from outside off. Found the gap between mid-on and mid-wicket and the result was a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shortish ball. Bad ball to start off the over. Might have been warming up. {{BATSMAN}} makes full use of it, cuts past the man at backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just over the fielder. {{BOWLER}} proving to be expensive today, already gone for 29 in 11 balls. He goes for the wide yorker, {{BATSMAN}} lines up by going down on his knee, slices it over backward point and just over the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50-run stand up with that blow. Was the googly around off, {{BATSMAN}} walked down the wicket and slammed it right past the bowler and the umpire who had to take evasive action\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, didn't I tell you that this is his day? {{BATSMAN}} survives once more. Fuller ball and he goes for the lofted stroke over cover. For a moment, the man at sweeper cover thought he had a chance but was late I guess. Put in a late dive and it bounced before him, then sped through to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, up and over! Shortish delivery, bowled at express speed. {{BATSMAN}} goes after it with a swing and gets an outside edge. Beats short third man and finds the fence on one bounce\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, yes, he was right. It's indeed the googly but {{BOWLER}} errs in length, getting it too short and following the batsman. {{BATSMAN}} backed away too far but manages to hack it past square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full, swinging in, clipped away, four..That sped away off the bat in a jiffy. Little bit of erring in line and put away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, seam-up delivery swinging away, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and punches it beautifully through covers, beating a diving Faf. First boundary for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rub in the luck too. Neat bouncer, at the nose, but {{BATSMAN}}'s already moving away, putting everything in his hooky-swing. Gets a fat edge that proves just enough to clear the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} gives it his all, shuffled across to get inside the line and powered it away along the ground to deep mid-wicket, no chance for Gill to get around\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, appeal for LBW, but I reckon it might have pitched outside leg. {{BATSMAN}} was setting himself up for a reverse sweep, lost his poise in doing so, ended up with a reverse hack, the ball clipped the pads and beat the slip fielder to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark with a boundary. Poor delivery from {{BOWLER}}, maybe he was trying to bowl the inswinger from just outside off stump but lost control and delivered a ball that was short and wide, easy cut shot through cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, horrendous start. He oversteps and dishes out a full delivery, {{BATSMAN}}'s hands take over, he drives it past extra cover and the ball raced away to the fence. No chance for the sweeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half-tracker and punished. {{BATSMAN}} camped back, twirls his wrists and hammers it to the cow corner fence. Shikhar had no chance cutting that off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, slower in on the pads. {{BATSMAN}} can't connect, flicking well before it gets there, rebounds and runs very fine, under Pant's late dive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full on the sticks, the batsman winds up for the heave and picks the delivery away into the on-side for a four. There was no one square on the on-side and a four to start the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower delivery and that's been put away to the fence again. Just outside off and on a length, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and pumps it right over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the Mumbai boy decides to take matters into his own hands and lays down the old traditional mow to send it away into the deep mid fence. One bounce and away she went\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that was a half-chance, but {{BOWLER}} was way too late to react - dropped short and at the stumps - {{BATSMAN}} backed away on the punch, was done in by the wrong 'un and looped it back at the bowler - huit it hard enough to bisect both men in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets it away very fine. Not exactly where he intended but {{BATSMAN}} will take this. Short of a length outside off, he went hard on the cut and got a big slice that flew away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not {{BOWLER}}'s night at all. Another drag-on, leg-stumpish and these are easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}. Sits back and swivels across to clatter the pull to the deep mid-wicket fence. The offie has been unusually erratic so far\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh that's vintage {{BATSMAN}}. Reaches fifty by planting his foot down to a length ball and crashing it through extra cover. Comforting sight for the dugout\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not great cricket overall, except from {{BOWLER}}. Bowled the slower one that spins away, {{BATSMAN}} looked ungainly while chipping this, because he was aiming cow corner. Just manages to clear mid-off, and there's Unadkat in the deep, sliding with the ball into the ropes..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just short and wide of mid-on, {{BATSMAN}} came charging down the track, doesn't get hold of the slog - off the toe-end and the ball lobbed in the air, to the left of mid-on who puts in a valiant dive, but can't reach it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very quick, almost yorker length on leg, misses by half an inch perhaps, and {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across to tickle it away to fine leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, you cannot bowl short to {{BATSMAN}}, you just cannot. {{BOWLER}} does the mistake and gets belted for a boundary. He picked up the length early crouched low and powers the pull shot wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first one of the innings for {{BATSMAN}}. Finally gets one right. Wasn't middled though! Short of a length delivery that kept a touch low, KP swung hard at it and got an inside edge that rolled past the man at short fine leg. The fielder in the deep was very square too, hence he couldn't quite get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gift of a delivery. A full toss. And {{BATSMAN}} laces that by backing away. Crunched it past cover for a four. Important four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary for {{TEAM}}. It was marginally short and {{BATSMAN}} is on it in a flash. Quickly transfers his weight and pulls it to deep mid-wicket. The fielder there had no chance of cutting that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off and running. No sighters needed. Short of length around off, {{BATSMAN}} hops a bit and directs the cut square on the off-side. There was a man at sweeper but he couldn't get there, such was the timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, plants his back knee across off stump and swipes this slower ball over short fine leg. Almost went for six, just the one bounce\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no frickin' way! Lady luck can't possibly be so mean! Back of a length outside off, jumps up and catches {{BATSMAN}} by surprise, who gets a leading edge which, believe me, goes through the gap at deep backward point for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor start from the young leggie. Real loosener - a rank long hop, offering a freebie for {{BATSMAN}} first up. The batsman rocks back and murders it over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, does not matter how they come as long as the runs keep coming for DD. The back of a length delivery on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} swivels to play the pull, misses and the ball lobs off thigh pad over de Kock\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picks the bones out of this disguise. The literacy means that he reads the slower one, waits on it and mows it through mid-wicket. A serious move on this\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} goes for the yorker, misses his length by an inch or two and {{BATSMAN}} takes heavy toll of it. The skipper gets under it and lofts it over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, errs in line this time and {{BATSMAN}} won't spare him. He gets in a good position and times his nudge to perfection. The outfield at Eden is a highway and it will run away for a boundary through fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow. Just mur{{BATSMAN}}r. Just AB things. Plonks in front, gives his arms the room to swing and then tonks this straight down, nearly all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh that seemed effortless. Short and angling in, {{BATSMAN}} was cramped on the pull, but lofted that over infield, the timing was good enough to clear long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flat one on the stumps, whip-driven straight down the ground for four. Finally, some runs in boundaries...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nothing wrong about this shot. Picked the short ball got early, gets into a strong position shuffling across and elevates it over backward square leg with his front foot off air. Pulled away!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, too short from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it past square leg, no one in the deep and it's a boundary - {{BATSMAN}}'s second of the night\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there was a man at deep square leg but {{BATSMAN}} still went for it and timed it properly. Got a hunch that a short ball was coming, quickly hung back and got on top of the bounce. Then employed some power and pulled it exactly where he wanted. To the right of deep square leg and it travels rapidly to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery from {{BOWLER}}, can't afford to release the pressure this way. MI don't have much to play with. Short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} sizes it up early and slaps it through point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a terrific shot! Wristy shot. Fired on leg and {{BATSMAN}} had his back leg off-air while he made contact. Whipped powerfully and finds the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket. Raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, yorker outside off, runs away fine past short third man. Faf reached out to it and got it right off the toe-end. What a miserable return for {{BOWLER}} this is turning to be\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, proper slice. He steps down, steps away and makes the length right into his slot to carve it away with a lot of bottom hand -- into that one-shot distance now ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh shot! Brilliant hit, the shot of the game thus far and will take some doing to beat this. A simple on-drive it looks like, but it's tough to play an on-drive with a straight bat to the right of mid-on, let the short of length delivery come and timed it sweetly, Rayudu gives chase and loses the race\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 10 off 2 balls. {{BOWLER}} continues to be expensive. Strays just a touch in line, bowls it on middle and leg, and {{BATSMAN}} glances it away past short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, {{BATSMAN}} picked this one though, the attempted wrong'un, {{BATSMAN}} gets a big stride forward, gets close to the ball and lifts it over cover, couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and now {{BATSMAN}} rubs it in. He's playing second fiddle mind you, but he's got enough punch lines with himself. Another horrific delivery, down leg, all it needs is a tickle and {{BATSMAN}} gives it a glance instead. Save your legs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower version of {{BOWLER}}'s slower ball but gets the line wrong. Loads of width and {{BATSMAN}} works it in his favour by going deep and cuts it fiercely past point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, almost carried to backward point! Reprieve for {{BATSMAN}}, he went after this flighted delivery on seeing the width but couldn't connect the drive well. Sliced it in the air and it just fell short of the diving fielder. Sneaked past him eventually and sped to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length at the body, {{BATSMAN}} looked like he was expecting it. He thumps the pull well in front of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged but no slip! You don't expect one at this stage of a T20 inning either for most bowlers. Lovely piece of bowling from {{BOWLER}}, floated up nicely to invite the drive from {{BATSMAN}} and forced the edge as well. Too hard for de Kock and it raced past him to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Sees the leg-break early, lunges across, opens the bat face and steers it past point. The fielder in the deep gets across and puts in a dive but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and punished! Width on offer outside off, {{BATSMAN}} opens the bat face and cuts it past the diving fielder at point. Can see a few Punjab flags in the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superb batting. This isn't all that short. But {{BATSMAN}}'s footwork is excellent, enabling him to spear this cut shot through point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, absolutely no mercy from {{BATSMAN}}. Well, a rank long hop doesn't deserve respect anyway. {{BATSMAN}} quickly rocks back and pulls powerfully, splits long-on and deep mid-wicket quite easily\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superb batting! Nothing much wrong with the ball. A wide-ish yorker at 135.1kph, {{BATSMAN}} opens his bat-face at the last moment to squirt it fine of the man at short third man. Just a hint of width and {{BATSMAN}} used the bowler's pace to his advantage\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, he's playing a gem of a cameo here. Fraction short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, waits on the ball and cuts it in front of square on the off-side, beats point to his right this time and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very full delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} set himself inside the crease and cleared his front leg while doing so, just pumped it over extra cover with disdain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, this is exquisite cricket from {{BATSMAN}}, back of a length and well outside off, he waits on it, opens the face of the bat and steers it to the left of wide slip, beats the man getting across from the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} firmly punches it through point. Lovely balance at the crease there. Didn't try to do something fancy. Just a proper cricket shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, too full and too wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets close to the ball, that allows him to play against the turn, beats extra-cover with the drive and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now that makes a lot of sense, third man is in, third man {{BATSMAN}} plays the reverse slog and connects really well. Clears the infield and it's a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's more Watto-like. A big forward plonk, leaning under the length and lofting this punch over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, why do you bowl that? Easy runs on offer for {{BATSMAN}} and he gets off the mark with a delightful stroke. Quicker and overpitched outside off, Yuvi plants his front leg forward and middles the drive. No chance for long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now this is class batting. He's chopped a ball - that was on off stump - and sent it really fine into the third man boundary. What makes it an even better shot is that it was the off-cutter from {{BOWLER}}, so it's not as if he had a lot of pace to work with\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, was that a drop? {{BOWLER}} is not a happy man. The reverse sweep from Maxi and he almost picked out backward point. Aniket is a tall man and he did get a fingertip on it. It was struck fiercely and Aniket did not have much time to react\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length slower delivery and the batsman pulls the ball away. Did not time it but gave it some good air miles. Once it landed, there was no one and it went into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a little bit of air from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} quickly bends his knees and swipes it to the wide long-on boundary. The length was a bit too full from {{BOWLER}} there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, such a sweet, sensible shot from the young man. Sees the short ball, that is slow too. Waits, dabs between short third man and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mowed away over mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} has had enough of plodding around. Sees this arm ball on a good length and clobbers it over mid-wicket. Easily over the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is at his best in the opening slot and he has started well for {{TEAM}}. On a good length and well outside off, he leans forward, plays with an open face and drives it on the up, beats cover and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this boundary means that 32 is required off the last over. {{BATSMAN}} gets into the scoop position again, and ramps this up over short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fourth boundary of the over, third one in a row. The shackles have been broken. Slower ball on middle, {{BATSMAN}} swipes agriculturally and gets enough off the inside half to impart the legs to roll into the square leg boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, spins away from a shorter length, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard and sends a thick edge fine of third man. Streaky, but {{BATSMAN}} won't mind\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, freebie from {{BOWLER}} and it's vanished to the fence in no time. Sprayed full and well down leg, {{BATSMAN}} just had to beat the man at short fine leg and he does so with a hard sweep. All too easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant from {{BATSMAN}}. That shot has been nipped out from Kohli's locker. Stands deep inside the crease and just opens the bat face to send the yorker between backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} bowls short first up to surprise him, but {{BATSMAN}} is quickly into position. He's able to swivel outside the line of the ball which is on leg-stump and helps the pull to the fine leg boundary. It's rocketed through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very sloppy from Dhawan. Attacked the ball in trying to prevent the second and gives away two more. Thrashed to him and in running to his left from sweeper, he lets it go through his hands. A slight bobble before the ball came to him, but still should've been stopped\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is getting disastrous for the young off spinner but he has only himself to blame. Another fuller ball down leg, this time {{BATSMAN}} doesn't fail to connect. Sweeps it very fine down the leg-side and past the fielder who was in the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the fielder at deep backward square leg has misjudged this. {{BATSMAN}} slogged this in the air, the fielder dived but couldn't get there. On the biggest night, {{TEAM}} have negated {{BOWLER}} without a wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that shall release some pressure. {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands at a wide-ish delivery as a thick outside edge is induced. It flies over Warner at slip and races away to the third man boundary. First one of the night for {{TEAM}}!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too much width gestures Raina as soon as he saw the ball flying over backward point. Tad short and {{BATSMAN}} pounced on the width on offer, slices the cut and gets four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half-volley, a rare one from {{BOWLER}}, and {{BATSMAN}} just has to step out as he crunches it through deep extra cover for four! Stunning shot!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide asking to be punished. {{BATSMAN}} crashes the cut wide of backward point who takes some pace off the ball with a dive. The ball has enough legs to dribble away past the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another one. He's timed this even better. Up and over extra-cover, the fielder dives in the deep but the ball sneaks through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, well, the plan was good from {{BOWLER}}, but the execution part went wrong. Swerving in, tried for the yorker but missed by a few inches. Ends up as a low full toss on the pads for {{BATSMAN}}, who gets across and flicks it past Gayle at short fine leg. Cricket can be cruel sometimes, ain't it?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sealed some more. Another poor delivery, slow, short, wide. Faf has all the time he needs, staying up tall and slicing over cover in the ring with nobody behind\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, attempted: big smoke over extra cover. The result: a big fat outside edge over short third man. {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}} couldn't care any less\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no, no. Wrong line {{BOWLER}}, searches for that banana swing. In the process, sprays it on the pads, the fine leg was inside the ring and easy put away for {{BATSMAN}}. Just nurdles it past the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is simple. {{BOWLER}} strays into the legs, and {{BATSMAN}} isn't foxed on this side of the wicket. Whips, with a lot of bottom-hand, splitting mid-wicket and mid-on\n",
            "San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he doesn't want the wi{{BATSMAN}}, he wants more. Sits almost as he connects, back knee on the ground, reaches out to a slower {{BATSMAN}}livery outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, carves it over backward point. That's enough. Had he left that, it was a wi{{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how easy does he make it look. Trademark of a class batsman! It was on a good length and was angling away from {{BATSMAN}} who leans into it and flays into the drive wide of cover like a boss. It beats the cover fielder and canters to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky! {{BOWLER}} bangs one short, {{BATSMAN}} waits for the ball, hops and elevates it over the slip cordon. There is no one to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} keeps marching on. Wickets won't make any difference to him, he'll play like he always does. This was a short delivery aimed at the hips and all {{BATSMAN}} had to do is help it on its way. Manages to do so and beats short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, handy blow from {{BATSMAN}}. He does pack a punch in his shots, as we saw during his batting promotion earlier this season. This is fractionally short and there is a lot of width as well, he waits for it and slaps hard past extra cover. Once it beat the infield, it was always racing to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, loses radar. Well down leg, and {{BATSMAN}} gets a tickle off his pads, under Quinton's rather lazy dive as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, with the point and cover point in, the fuller ball was a bad idea. {{BATSMAN}} got his bat down and slammed it over point for a four. The wrists of steel came into play\n",
            "Na{{BATSMAN}}em to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swept away for four. De {{BATSMAN}} has started off brilliantly. Na{{BATSMAN}}em lands it on a length for him and is dispatched\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for the Mumbai skipper and he gets there with a boundary. 5000 runs earlier in the day, and now a good fifty-plus innings. Premeditates this one and scoops the full toss towards the fine leg fence. Almost cleared the boundary there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's bowled pretty short to {{BATSMAN}} so far, and unlike before, this time he's punished for it. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and thumps his pull over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short. {{BATSMAN}} rocks behind, lining up well to allow the ball to do its bit and then cut it away really late past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor from {{BOWLER}}. Drops it very short, and then turns it into leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} is able to free his arms on the pull as he whacks it to the long leg boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, aims for the blockhole and does well. {{BATSMAN}} inside edges the drive past the keeper into the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged, and gone for four! Fortuitous boundary to third man. Knuckle ball pitching on a length, seaming away, {{BATSMAN}} gets a controlled outside edge with soft hands and it rolls away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, heaved away. That kinda slower delivery that gives away its cards early because it's been pitched on a length. {{BATSMAN}} delays his cross-batted mow and picks a boundary through wide long-on. Uppish and safe\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, continues backing away in the crease, giving his arms the free-up space and slaps, hard, through point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, was that a half-chance? Short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} got on top of the bounce as he cut, didn't bother to keep it down, went to the right and well wide of Uthappa at backward point, the man in the deep has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length {{BATSMAN}}livery on the pads and heaved away off the inner half of the bat. The ball dribbled away towards the {{BATSMAN}}ep mid fence for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and again.. But not as well timed as the previous one. Flighted on a fullish length, {{BATSMAN}} lofts it straight back over {{BOWLER}} and the ball bounces just inside the rope before beating the long-on fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, width available on this delivery, {{BATSMAN}} makes full use of the room and punches it wide of deep backward point for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's bullied down the ground at long-off. My god! What power from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} errs and bowls it in the slot for him. No chance for the fielder there, it just rocketed away to the fence in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is brilliant batting from the Victorian. Sees it in his slot and lifts it handsomely over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, errs in length, which is short, errs in line, which is wide. Enough said. The batsman cashes into the blank cheque of a delivery with the flay of the arms and stroked it beautifully through the heavily manned off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball outside off, there was enough width for {{BATSMAN}} to free his arms and he does so by slapping this through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot of the innings so far. Flamboyance from {{BATSMAN}}. Krishna corrects his length and wafts it full outside off. {{BATSMAN}} bends low, chases it and drives it off the meat through extra cover. It just zoomed away to the fence in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, played! Finesse in that shot. Goes down on his knee and scoops the floater right past the keeper. No fine leg in place and that shall be four runs for YJB\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, excellent batting. He is intimidating the bowlers here. {{BOWLER}} is not tossing them up now, {{BATSMAN}} stays on the back foot and thumps it past the diving extra cover fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too much width and {{BATSMAN}} says thank you. Crouches and pierces the gap between backward point and short third. Amazing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, the slower off-cutter from {{BOWLER}}, did {{BATSMAN}} in for pace - was early into the drive and the thick edge runs past the keeper for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's hit that with a battering ram! Makes some room, {{BOWLER}} darts it into the slot for {{BATSMAN}} who tonks the leather off it by muscling it back over the bowler's head. {{BOWLER}} tried going for the catch, but by then the ball was whistling into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good placement. Just a bit of width outside off and that's enough for {{BATSMAN}}. Jumps, opens his bat-face at the last moment and forces it through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss, drilled hard between the sticks and the non-striker, Dre Russ can't cut it off running from long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rubbish to start off from {{BOWLER}}. Long hop asking to be punished, {{BATSMAN}} obliges, rocks back and pulls it in front of square on the leg-side, one bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes short and {{BATSMAN}} gets off the mark with four. On the body, pulled hard through mid-wicket and {{BATSMAN}} finds the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is excellent batting from {{BATSMAN}}, tad too full from {{BOWLER}}, can't do so with mid-on insi{{BATSMAN}} the ring - {{BATSMAN}} gets a good stri{{BATSMAN}} forward and lifts it over that man, almost went all the way, one bounce and over the ropes - 18 from the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drag-down of a leg-break, {{BATSMAN}} gets on the back foot, clears the front leg, and whip-pulls that to deep square leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the last ball goes for four. Dragged down and {{BATSMAN}} lapped it over short fine's head. Needed to get enough bat to clear the fielder and did so. Poor end to the powerplay for RCB\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finally, he guides this in the gap and that spoils a good over for {{BOWLER}}. Bowled pretty well to be honest. Back of a length and outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} steers it between backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, tossed up nicely by {{BOWLER}}, right in the zone for {{BATSMAN}}, he clears his left leg and drills it back over the bowler's head, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, too full and too wi{{BATSMAN}} of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets well forward and drills it over cover, couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hammered, he's having a ball tonight, length ball at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} clears his left leg and shovels it wide of long-on, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} gaining some momentum and it is the local boy - {{BATSMAN}} who is leading the charge, flighted delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} reverse sweeps it backward of point and starts the over with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, AB shuffles and meets this ball on the full, sits on one knee and swats it in the gap between {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket and {{BATSMAN}}ep square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundary to start the 18th. The slower delivery that drifts onto the batsman's hips, {{BATSMAN}} does not do anything fancy, tickles it round the corner and allows the outfield to do the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's a full toss, the idea was there to give the ball a bit more air, but the execution wasn't great. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't try to over-hit the ball, places the flick between long-on and deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} will use his feet against the spinners. Is quick to get out of the box and gets to the pitch of the flighted delivery, thumps it past the bowler. {{BOWLER}} had no chance to even get a fingertip on that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's joining the party. Very slow from {{BOWLER}}, trying to get {{BATSMAN}} to miscue one, but doesn't on this occasion. Makes room, waits for the dip and lofts it over straight mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} under serious pressure. This is scintillating batting. He goes wide of off again, and is carted over extra-cover again. An unabridged swing of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, his first boundary today and it's come off a thick inside edge past short fine. {{BOWLER}} bowls this in the blockhole just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} jams down on it and squirts it away past leg-stump\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot mahn! {{BATSMAN}} has this unique way of pulling the ball. It was around the hip-height, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and powers the pull shot wide of short fine leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} unfurls his expertise. Hammers it on a short of length, {{BATSMAN}} walks across and scoops it over short fine leg. Cheeky and mighty effective\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, promising start here from {{BATSMAN}}. A couple of boundaries already. This is flat at the stumps, and he's down on one knee to put the slog-sweep away through deep midwicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot! Another 50+ stand for the duo. Continuing from where they had left off in Pune. Loopy leg-break on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} makes just a bit of room and chips it beautifully inside out. The onus was on timing rather than power. Long-off dived in vain to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more. Already 22 off the over. A game-changing over this. Fifty up for {{BOWLER}}. Full and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink at that and the outside edge flies wide of Dhoni\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overcorrects his line and is made to pay. On a length on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} leans into the flick and strikes it square past the umpire, no chance for fine leg to get across and stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR. Right into his plate. Sits up perfectly for {{BATSMAN}}, he lifts it with lovely extension of the arms over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a good shot. But he looks at his bat. Not entirely happy with the connection. Saw the tossed up delivery and charged {{BOWLER}}, to the pitch and lofted wide and over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, doesn't matter what spinner this is - it's a full toss, down leg. {{BATSMAN}}'s on a knee, sweeping, slogging, everything\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, doesn't start well and on this pitch, there is little margin for error. Slightly short and a bit of width as well, {{BATSMAN}} sits back and crunches it through the covers. Found the gap and the outfield did the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a glorious front-foot punch through covers. Gets on his toes and on top of the bounce to pack a punch through diving cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very, very Caribbean. Okay former Caribbean. {{BATSMAN}} transfer back, lets the ball get on par and waits on his drive, opening it to pierce the gap behind point. And that gap is huge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how is that for a start? Gentle half-volley from {{BOWLER}} alright but look at that execution from {{BATSMAN}}. Just leans into the drive and caresses the drive wide of mid-off. Class!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, who'd've thought the world's best Test batsman would out-unorthodox a Maxi? Just paddle-pulls an express-pacer to fine leg, over short fine leg for four! Falls to his knees, avoiding the hit on the head, and gets a deflection on it over the in-field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he does it again. Pierces the gap between the keeper and short third. Again with the outside edge. Crashes a bat throw at a wide delivery, just doesn't reach out fully but meaty enough with the outside carve flying away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, inswinger, {{BATSMAN}} exposes all his stumps and spanks it straight down the ground. Sheer power\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, been a rusty start from {{BOWLER}}, who now doles out a half-volley on the pads of {{BATSMAN}}. Gleefully flicked through midwicket, the timing is superb\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 148.2km/h of wasted energy as he dishes out a half-volley on the pads, and {{BATSMAN}} gets a tasty starter, flicks it off his pads towards the backward square leg fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that'll give him some confidence. Length delivery on middle, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and pummels this one over mid-wicket, that's a fine shot by the southpaw\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very low full toss, marginally outside off. But {{BATSMAN}} after backing away manages to stick his bat out and somehow connect to get it really fine past backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there you go! {{BATSMAN}} breaks the string of dots with a sublime boundary. Makes a hint of room, stays leg-side of the full delivery and clobbers it through extra cover with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets well across, wanting to go over mid-wicket. And typically changes his mind, like only he can. Ruins a wi{{BATSMAN}} yorker, slicing it through extra cover all of a sud{{BATSMAN}}n. Just sublime. And yes, a fifty .. he's killing the contest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is underway straightaway! Poor ball from Shardul {{BOWLER}}. Ample width outside off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't over-hit, reaches out and cuts it through point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this has been pummelled away. Banged in short by {{BOWLER}} and this is the normal pace delivery, sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} who swats the pull through backward square leg. The man from deep square did try hard to get to it but was never going to reach it in time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overpitched outside off and {{BATSMAN}} crashes it through extra-cover. Blistering shot. He's in some good hitting form, carrying on from the last match\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the invitation there from the bowler with the flighted delivery, you can't blame him because he's going for wickets. But just that he's bowled this too full for the batsman to be troubled and {{BATSMAN}} smashes it straight over the non-striker's head to take long-on out of the equation\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, kaboooooom! That's been smashed to pulp and it's {{BATSMAN}} who has done it. Things that an IPL season does. Even the gracious batsmen look for power. Uses his feet and smacks it hard over the bowler's head. {{BOWLER}} may have thought about a return catch but there was no time at all to react, chose to wisely save himself\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he does this so often! Uses the pace of the bowler and just dabs it fine to send the ball racing away to deep third man for a four. Was wide, and {{BATSMAN}} just got enough wood to send the ball away. 12 runs off the over. {{BOWLER}} has gone for 37 already\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the slogs continue. This time off {{BATSMAN}}'s bat. Walks himself into the line, sees the defensive trajectory on the pads and just whips it off an angled blade. A bounce into the fence behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air and over short third. {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down and {{BOWLER}} pushed it wide, the outside edge flies towards Aniket, who misjudged it slightly by moving in and by the time he tracked back, the ball was over him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overpitches outside off, {{BATSMAN}} muscles the drive wide of long-off. Doing it in a canter\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smacked over mid-wicket. Rare loose ball from {{BOWLER}}, a rank long hop and {{BATSMAN}} was so quick to read it. Hangs back and places it supremely in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 16 runs off the over! {{BATSMAN}} is in a hurry to finish this match. Another slower ball, shortish in length, {{BATSMAN}} gets behind the line by shuffling across and pulls it nicely over backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed. Too full and {{BATSMAN}} used his levers to bullet it past the umpire. Who did well to get out of the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, starts round the wicket and gets it to turn a bit around off. {{BATSMAN}} goes back to cut, the ball keeps a bit low and takes the under edge. Goes between the legs of Parthiv. Bumrah, from short fine leg, gives the chase for a while before the ball beats him to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, should I, shouldn't I.. while Harbhajan deliberates on the dive, the ball goes through. Another deft touch from {{BATSMAN}}, dabbing this flat leg-break fine of backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's classy from {{BATSMAN}}. This bouncing ball was cramping him for room, but he arched back and then created his own momentum to cut it over backward point. Wi{{BATSMAN}} of sweeper as well. That's a top top shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery! This is a pressure-releaser. Short and wide outside off stump, really poor delivery, {{BATSMAN}} cuts uppishly to the left of backward point and third man had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 141kph, full on off and middle, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and there's the quick hands from {{BATSMAN}} to flick it through backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, premeditates a paddle-sweep, then has to reach for it as {{BOWLER}} bowls this well wide outside off, but somehow gets a top-edge over the keeper's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, terrific effort from Mandeep. But the ball slips out and rolls into the rope. Flatter and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} had the width and he slapped it to wide long-off, Mandeep ran across and put in a full length dive, got one hand to it but the ball did not stlick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more. Flatter outside off but it's full again, and {{BATSMAN}} smokes a flat-batted drive wide of long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely placement from {{BATSMAN}}! Gives himself a bit of room and sits on one knee to pull this short ball in the gap between deep mid-wicket and deep square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, right off the toe-end of the bat as {{BATSMAN}} chases a very wide ball from {{BOWLER}}, squirts it away past the keeper into the third man boundary. Went very fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stand and dismiss stuff from {{BATSMAN}}. Just admires the shot, knew the moment he connected it was a boundary. {{BOWLER}} serves it full, in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} blasts it with ease to the long-off fence. The fielder was squarer and had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} waits for it, gets on top of the bounce and slaps it over mid-off. The fielder was inside the ring and he just had to clear him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} taking on the {{BOWLER}} brothers. Makes room for himself and lofts the tossed up delivery straight over the bowler's head, four more for the youngster\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh no! Not there! {{BOWLER}} tried to nail the leg stump toe-crusher but bowled a low full toss down leg, {{BATSMAN}} happily helps it away to fine leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, long half-volley on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, that's easy pickings for him, prods across and clips it in front of square on the on-side. The man in the deep is square and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is good batting, knows {{BOWLER}} isn't going to toss the ball up, so has a short backlift to reverse lap this flatter ball past short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} puts it away with ease. Coming in at 116ks and it's right on the pads for {{BATSMAN}} to unleash those whippy wrists and play the aerial flick over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss, come on you have to do better than that. {{BATSMAN}} stands his ground and heaves it over mid-wicket, no one in the deep to stop that. Can he record the fastest fifty this season?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another impressive hit by {{BATSMAN}}. Comes down the wicket, converts the length into a full one and hammers it past {{BOWLER}}. That raced away to the fence in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's so pleasing to watch. Moves aside to open up a bit and then goes inside out over cover. Races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rank length, quite leg-lined too .. and {{BATSMAN}}'s quickly under it, sitting on a knee and sweeping it firmly through square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's muscled that! Look at that ball go so flat and one bounce into the wide long-off fence. Slower delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} steps out and the ball sat up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} to free his arms and smash\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, that's above the waist, and hence a no-ball. {{BATSMAN}} nicely arches away before realizing that he can get some bat on this. Glides it uppishly through third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not where he inten{{BATSMAN}}d, but the final result is what he was looking for. Floated up outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to go over long-off, sliced over backward point and Sundar saw the ball balloon over him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a boundary for {{TEAM}} after 24 balls. {{BATSMAN}} clears the front leg and spears a full ball through extra-cover. Mid-off was up in the ring and he just had to find the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, you don't bowl short to this guy, not unless you're express. Such fast hands as he dispatches a pull through mid-wicket. The man in the deep is too square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss, dipping and the batsman clips the ball away past {{BOWLER}}ep square leg for a four. That was superb from {{BATSMAN}} as he gets it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sloppy from Rajat Bhatia at short fine! He was put off by the appeal for lbw from the keeper and {{BOWLER}}. It was the slider which was very full. {{BATSMAN}} just about brings his bat down and gets a bit of wood on it. Bhatia over-runs to his left and allows the ball to go past him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball, {{BATSMAN}} stays back and pulls it down to deep mid for a four. Was in the gap between deep mid and long-on. {{TEAM}} on a roll post the drop!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower delivery sitting up, and the perils of having DK at the death. Hits the pull flat over the mid-wicket region. It's racing away.. it's a four!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Jas B isn't nailing those yorkers. Low full toss outsi{{BATSMAN}} off stump, {{BATSMAN}} lofts straight down the ground and any batsman need not hit such {{BATSMAN}}liveries hard, just placed over the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's toying around with the bowling, {{BATSMAN}}. Another loose half tracker and he picks it up with a shovel pull over short fine leg. Wrong line and duly punished\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done by Davey! Premeditates and puts this straighter delivery away to the deep point fence with a well timed reverse sweep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, make that three in a row! Too full and {{BATSMAN}} slices the drive behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Pat {{BATSMAN}} would have grown up playing such shots and the length was ideal. Short at 138ks and right in the slot for him, powers the pull and gets it in the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} puts his dancing shoes on and lifts it over the bowler's head. Such clean hitting, holds his shape and earns a boundary. The key was he picked the length and met the pitch at the right time, then his fast hands taking over to execute the shot. It bounces just inside the ad cushions\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a freebie for any batsman. {{BOWLER}} gets a bit greedy tries to swing it away from middle and leg, but the ball keeps going with the angle, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it stylishly backward of square and the new cherry races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back fours for {{BATSMAN}}. This is a well-calculated shot. Just got inside the line of this slower ball and helped it over short fine leg's head disdainfully. Fantastic start to the 19th over for Delhi\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, charges down and even though {{BOWLER}} digs it in short, {{BATSMAN}} pulls with a full pivot of the front leg, split deep mid-wicket and deep square leg to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, whack! Short ball angling into the body, {{BATSMAN}} gets into good position and telegraphs the pull to the left of fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, strays on the pads @139.7km/h, futile pace, {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes light up as he sees it's on his pads, just closes the face on the ball at the last moment to glance it away in front of deep square leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not impressive lines by {{BOWLER}}. Straying on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} clips it through square leg as the impeccable timing sends the ball to the deep square leg boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's textbook stuff from {{BATSMAN}}. Half-volley just outsi{{BOWLER}} off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and middles the straight-drive. That's Instagrammable\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pouncing on the pace. Pouncing on the bounce. 142kays of it and {{BATSMAN}} throws everything at it as he hacks it. And even a mistime is enough on this carpet to race it away into the fence - the mid-wicket one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just past the diving mid-wicket fielder! But this was struck beautifully by {{BATSMAN}}. Sat deep to this extra fullish delivery and jabbed it with those strong wrists of it. Flew off the bat and sped to the fence in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's {{BATSMAN}} at his best. Brings the crowd to life. A shimmy down the wicket and then throws his fast hands on the short of length delivery, scythed over extra-cover. Brutal hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, freebie and {{BATSMAN}} puts it away. Need to make this into a big over now. Long hop and {{BATSMAN}} had ample time to pick his spot, rocked back and pulled it in front of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third man isn't there. {{BATSMAN}} has a measure of it, and holds his cut back. Waits, lets it get close and chops it to pierce slip and short third, to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a shot to get off the mark. {{BATSMAN}} on the walk, trying to get ahead of {{BOWLER}} and prove his superiority over him. Converts a length ball into a half-volley and drives it wide of mid-off, superb shot and all along the ground, lovely way to get going and a statement made by {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, does it again! {{BATSMAN}} is determined not to let his former {{TEAM}} teammate settle. Stays in the crease this time and just gets leg-side of the ball a touch before launching it inside out over extra cover. Delicious strokeplay!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full, too fine from {{BOWLER}} and that would run away. First four of the innings. Bad ball and put away with a cheeky touch through fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, plenty of room on offer and {{BATSMAN}} has nailed the cover-drive to perfection, pierced the gap between cover and extra-cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drilled through extra cover! Pitched on a full length and {{BATSMAN}} creams it past the fielder at wide mid-off. Pressure on the bowler, 14 runs of the over already. Still 3 balls to go!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sits down on one knee, picks the length early and swipes it over square leg with sheer timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top shot! {{BOWLER}} switches to round the wicket, fires in a low full toss around off, {{BATSMAN}} stays low, opens the bat face and threads it behind point, right between short third man and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, too short from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, doesn't bother to keep it down and pulls it over square leg, one bounce and over the ropes - a shot of real authority\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, don't understand this field. Mid-off in at this stage to a player who loves lofting the ball straight. {{BOWLER}} dishes out a full ball and {{BATSMAN}} happily powers it over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, almost got himself in trouble looking to pull a ball that wasn't very short. It skids through off a length, headed towards middle and leg. But {{BATSMAN}} manages to get it off a thick under-edge, which then beats Shami at short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, filthy loose a line. Full, leg-lined and {{BATSMAN}} just waits for it to get close before whipping it really fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the French cut now. {{BATSMAN}} keeping the flag fluttering up there. Gets himself too close for the cut but swishes through. Chops it off the under edge past the keeper. So very French\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow. That was hammered ferociously. {{BATSMAN}} charges down the track and smacks it down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nine off the over! Fuller length delivery attacking the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} stays leg-side of the ball and creams the drive through vacant extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Stupendous shot. {{BOWLER}} starts with an 117kph half-volley outside off, {{BATSMAN}} spots it like a hawk, waits for it and drills it through the covers. There was a man in the deep, all he could do was watch it go past the boundary rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a freebie from {{BOWLER}}. A flat leggie at 89.4kph, on the shorter side too. {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and slaps it through the covers. Authoritative shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a new man, the same old line down leg and the same old response. Doesn't matter that it is only the first ball he's facing. Whips it away with enough chunk of wood on it to take it behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, similar to the previous delivery and this time {{BATSMAN}} uses the pace on the ball smartly, waits and back cuts it behind point, bisected the two fielders there to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! Would've been swallowed by the first slip fielder, if there was ever one. Lovely flight from {{BOWLER}}, drew {{BATSMAN}} forward and takes the outside edge which runs away through the invisible first slip region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four first ball for {{BATSMAN}} who has promoted himself to No. 3. Full on leg-stump, the ball is ducking in sharply and {{BATSMAN}} just about gets some bat on it to help it along while yanking his leg away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh these hands. {{BOWLER}} keeps dishing out full-paced stuff, and overcooks don't help his cause either. {{BATSMAN}} shuffles, leaning to bottom-hand it into extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant effort by Gurkeerat at long-on! Raced across to his left and dived full-length but couldn't do much. Seemed like a mishit from {{BATSMAN}} initially, went hard on the halfvolley from {{BOWLER}} but did well to go dead straight down the ground. One bounce into the ad hoardings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! On the pads to any sub-continent batsman, he won't spare you. He moves slightly across and middles the leg-glance. The quick Delhi outfield does the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, bonus runs! {{BATSMAN}} checks his back a bit as that had struck him above the thigh pad. Back of a length around leg, he missed the flick off the back foot and it sped past a diving Saha to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, they're taking the game away in a rush. Pitched up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands where he is, no movement of the feet and crashes it through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rocks back to this short ball and thumps it through square leg. Rollicking entry into the season from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and the inside edge for four. That's just kept {{TEAM}} in it. Full ball angled in on leg, it was in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} swings hard, only to send it racing off the inside edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is playing a blinder here. {{BOWLER}} goes short and outside off, it was the off-speed delivery and {{BATSMAN}} spotted it early, carves it up and over backward point. No need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's on an absolute roll. Succeeds with the scoop this time, something which he was trying earlier in the over. Walks across, gets a length ball and ramps it over short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, both batsmen have a good time out in the middle. They're making the most out of these powerplay overs. {{BATSMAN}} puts down on his dancing shoes and slices the short ball over cover-point. No fielder in the deep and that's a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finishes his spell with a boundary. But that still doesn't spoil his figures - 4-1-20-2. {{BOWLER}} stopped and caught his hamstring and then went back to rebowl this final ball. A bit of a niggle might have hampered his line and length - short and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slaps the cut square and it races off the turf to beat sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} ends the innings in style. This has been the innings of highest quality from the southpaw. And he has powered his team to a formidable total! It was a full-toss on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles to the off-side and smashes it wide of deep fine leg to end the innings with a four!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, width on offer from {{BOWLER}}, Karun arches back, waits on the ball and cuts it late - gets it into the gap behind point and beats the fielder getting across to his left from deep point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tickled and fifty for captain {{BATSMAN}}. Immediately raises the bat to the dug-out and the crowd. Looks determined as always. Really terrible short of length delivery down the leg-side, just helped on its way with fine leg inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the slower ball doesn't stick on the surface and sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} to thrash that away for four with a pull shot. Hit with some power and the man in the deep had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much-needed boundary for {{BATSMAN}}, spotted the slower ball and then delayed the pull, gets it wide of mid-wicket and runs away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overcooks it now at full pace. {{BATSMAN}} opens his bat face and squeezes this between point and short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a sizzler! He's absolutely scythed that through point. A little bit of width from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} adds to it by making some room and slashes it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, similar delivery but the field is slightly tinkered to {{BATSMAN}}. Sweeper cover was brought in and extra cover was moved back. {{BATSMAN}} knew it, so went deep and flashed it in the pocket between cover and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another fine shot by {{BATSMAN}}! Looks in sublime touch. Reaches out for the overpitched delivery wide ball and chips it over cover-point. There were two fielders inside the circle and this ball cleared them by some distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, fraction too full and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans into the drive and places it into the gap past cover-point, beats the infield and runs away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good shot. Not all that and he latches on to it, rocks back and pulls hard wide of mid-on. Races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, even with a sweeper {{BATSMAN}} collects a boundary. {{BOWLER}} is still searching for swing, pitches it up and {{BATSMAN}} leans forward to caress the drive through cover. de Grandhomme gave up the chase early\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, make that 17 off the over. After the polite timing, {{BATSMAN}} gets out his violent streak now. Crashes the cut ferociously. Square like a tracer\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much needed boundary for {{TEAM}}. A walk down the track from {{BATSMAN}} to on-drive the short of length delivery to the right of {{BOWLER}}. No chance for long-on. High elbow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets it away very fine. Smart batting from {{BATSMAN}} but this is equally poor from {{BOWLER}} who is having a horror night. Too straight in line on this short ball, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across to get inside the line and pulls it away. Fine leg was too square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a wood chopper! Takes on a full half-volley and slices the whacky-drive over a leaping exra cover. Bhajji was the fielder and he may have got a fingertip on that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} puts this away. Much needed release of pressure. Short googly from {{BOWLER}}, the {{TEAM}} captain sits back and pumps it through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bowling against left-handers for a left-arm spinner is never an easy prospect and {{BOWLER}} is finding it really tough at the moment. It was on the shorter side and there was width, {{BATSMAN}} uses the width to good effect and punches it wide of cover for another four. He is looking in fabulous touch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not a great line by {{BOWLER}}! Short ball at the hips and {{BATSMAN}} glances it past the fielder at short fine leg with nonchalance. All he had to is get some bat on it, which he does. The pace at which {{BOWLER}} is bowling makes it easy to take it away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much more like it. That is his strength. Anything slightly full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} just frees his arms and lofts it straight back over the bowler, one bounce and over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time he goes much wider of long-on for a boundary. Nice use of the feet which takes him close enough to the ball that he can confidently whip his wrists against the turn. Good start from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nothing wrong with that, a back of a length delivery @137.1km/h, {{BATSMAN}} stays stable on the backfoot and opens the face, surgically bisects the field behind point for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, strays into the pad line, 147.8km/h of wasted gas, and that's tickled away with all the pace working against the bowler, for a boundary to fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, leg-cutter. Seams away. {{BATSMAN}} gets squared, and edges it straight to first slip. Well, well. There's no first slip, and third man can't come around either\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 120.2kph, whacks it alright. Kumar once again loses his line on the change of pace, keeping it short and wide outside off. {{BATSMAN}} - for a change - doesn't commit early, waiting on it to slap it through sweeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too many deliveries on the shorter side in this over and {{BATSMAN}} finally gets hold of one. He rocks back and pulls it away wide of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off and running. That is a super shot. Not much wrong with the delivery. Good length just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drives with minimal footwork and pierces the gap wide of cover. The timing was exquisite\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is rubbish bowling! With third man up, the only thing you shouldn't do is provide width. {{BOWLER}} does just that and it's a full toss too to compound the miseries for DC. {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat at it and gets a slice that beats the fielder to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just too easy. Strays down leg, and then refuses to turn back in. But {{BATSMAN}} turns on his heel, swivelling big to heave it away fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries - {{BATSMAN}} is batting beautifully, men inside the ring in the off-side and he's opening up that gap with subtle feet movements - backs away to a length ball and then cuts it behind square on the off-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pulled away and Faf is looking to mae the most of the final over of the powerplay, back of a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} waits and pulls behind square, the man in the deep is very square and it goes to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is a sonorous sound off the bat, not for the bowler of course. Is not that full around off, but {{BATSMAN}} trusts the pace and drives on the up, past cover and into the fence in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball with a slip in place! A short of length delivery on the pads. {{BATSMAN}} shuffles and glances. Off the inside edge and the ball races away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from Sran and {{BATSMAN}} was all over it. Reaches out on the drive and flat-bats it past cover, beat the infield and rolled away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's past backward point's dive. Got the ball to straighten on off-stump, which makes {{BATSMAN}}'s shot a good one. Didn't have much room to work, so uses his cocked wrists and thrusts the ball away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he has done it! Make way for the men in yellow, for there are plenty of them who are storming to the middle to jump over {{BATSMAN}}. Careful of that hamstring though. Oh forget about it, no one cares anymore. Full ball from {{BOWLER}}, drilled through the covers. What a finish. Unbelievable\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's an impressive drive. Only the second delivery he's facing, superb stuff. Fullish delivery, slower in pace too, {{BATSMAN}} reads it well and creams his drive and gets it past wide mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50-stand comes up between the duo. Short and width are like oxygen to {{BATSMAN}}. Gets on top of the bounce and caresses it through cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sliding on off-stump from round the wicket, and {{BATSMAN}}'s greeted him with a reverse-sweep that he deftly places wide of the lone slipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} struggling against the left hander! {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knee and lifts the tossed up delivery over square leg for four runs this time around\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Rashid lost in the lights there. And he has allowed it to go for a boundary. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and thumps it straight to sweeper cover. Rashid should have stopped it on the bounce but instead he lets it go and gifts a boundary to Kings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, when it is pitched up, {{BATSMAN}} looks to go over the top. Has come out with an aggressive intent. This was full outside off, he lofted it cleanly and wide of mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done! Didn't over-hit and relied on timing. Scrambled seam short of length delivery, on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} hops across and tucks it through square leg. No chance for the long leg fielder to cut it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries to end the first over. Again, {{BOWLER}} is a tad short in his length, {{BATSMAN}} had the width to cut and he didn't try to hit it hard, just placed it behind point and Bhuvi at third man gave up the chase pretty quickly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's not a bad delivery but a fine shot. {{BOWLER}} spears in the wide yorker outside off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and opens the bat face to slice the drive behind square on the off-side, no chance for the sweeper to get across\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a pie for {{BATSMAN}}. Short, width and studded with pace on it outside off. {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat and crunches it through the packed off-side field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, CSK have not done their homework. That was short again and the batsman stays back to pull the ball away with a lot of control. The man at deep fine had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that was an explosive drive from {{BATSMAN}}. Full and wide, the batsman threw the kitchen sink piled with utensils to spear that between cover and mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} is getting a move-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's what players like {{BATSMAN}} do. Let the bowler bowl to his strengths that is. It was full, but the line's wide of off-stump, KW leans forward and creams the drive wide of mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, intent from {{BATSMAN}} straightaway, much better from the Karnataka lad. It was a flighted delivery and was spinning back into {{BATSMAN}}, he plunges forward and lofts it straight down the ground for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bulldozed away! Came down the track and {{BOWLER}} adjusted with a shorter one wi{{BATSMAN}}r outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, flat-batted powerfully straight down the ground. Long-on was wi{{BATSMAN}}r and had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, proper half volley. That's no hard work for {{BATSMAN}}, just cruising through the line and drilling it through deep extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} sought to fox {{BATSMAN}} once again but {{BATSMAN}} outfoxes him. Slipped it wider of off on seeing the batsman back away. {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat, reaches out and slaps it with ferocity, beating the packed off-side field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, fraction too short from {{BOWLER}} , {{BATSMAN}} is quick to rock back and pulls it through mid-wicket, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's an audacious pull shot from {{BATSMAN}} to his countrymen. KG tried the slower delivery but dropped it short, Faf played the, aah let it come pull shot over the infield over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged away! Full length delivery around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} takes on the bowler, swings hard and gets an outside edge that flies over the slip cordon to find the fence. Every boundary {{BATSMAN}} hits from here on will hurt Jadeja\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. That's his second of the season and it has been a brutal innings. Apart from the first ball, it was a decent over from {{BOWLER}}. He went full and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and whips it in front of square. The shot was on as fine leg and square leg were inside the ring. He raises his bat and soaks in the applause of his team mates\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! A short of a good length ball at 133.4kph, {{BATSMAN}} stays back in his crease and punches it superbly through the gap between cover and cover-point. Once he found the gap, the outfield did the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a poor delivery to start off. Gifts a juicy full toss on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets down on his knee and sweeps it over square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, a hat-trick of boundaries ruins the over, lovely ball from {{BOWLER}}, cut back in sharply from a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was caught on the back-foot as he wafted, got beaten on the inside edge and the ball further swung away, leaving Ishan Kishan stranded\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, woah! Back-to-back fours. Wonderful start for the Royals. This was all timing from {{BATSMAN}}. Very full and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and checks his drive, flawless timing and it beats mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's reached that stage where it just doesn't matter what you bowl. So this is on a back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} goes up tall to it and with a very straight bat-flow, tonks it over the bowler's head. Outrageous\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} looks in his elements today. It was a slower one on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} picks it up early, delays his bat swing and smashes it over cover for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, leggie on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} clears his leg and flicks it nonchalantly, he finds the gap wi{{BATSMAN}} of long-on and it thuds into the fence. Welcome boundary for {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short fine leg is motionless as {{BATSMAN}} helps this pull shot past him. Poor ball really. Angled into the body from round the wicket, all {{BATSMAN}} has to do is to miss the lone fielder after swivelling across and that's what he does as he leaves Surya a mere statue\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now then, now then, how about that for placement? What confidence to play such a shot when he has not even scored a run. Third man was inside the ring, {{BATSMAN}} spotted that, as soon as he saw room on the ball, {{BATSMAN}} guided it late and split short third man and backward point to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is turning out to be an expensive over. Length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't go hard on his drive. Gets it wide of extra cover and the long-off fielder can't cut it off either\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice shot! There wasn't room there for {{BATSMAN}} to free his arms. He goes deep in his crease and manufactures his own to cut it through covers. A teasing chase for the cover fielder. Escorts the ball till the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundaries continue to flow. Short and slow on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and pulls it past the fielder at short fine leg, does well to get it past him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length outside off, punched through backward point. With this field - no protection deep on the off-side - there's no room to offer any width which {{BOWLER}} has done a couple of times already\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed away! A trifle too short from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} picked the length early. Swivelled and pulled it hard, bisecting deep mid-wicket and long-on perfectly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, {{BOWLER}} tosses one wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets a big stride forward and drills it through extra-cover, beats the man getting across to his left from long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's such a good shot and so difficult to do against {{BOWLER}}. He's able to gallop down to the pitch of the ball to lift it back over the bowler's head. Really well played\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he does this time. Rocks back and nails the cut square on the off-side. No-one moved\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, strays on the pads @139.7km/h, futile pace, {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes light up as he sees it's on his pads, just closes the face on the ball at the last moment to glance it away in front of deep square leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stylish shot! Not that bad a ball, almost the perfect yorker but {{BATSMAN}} was making room and with third man in the ring, it was only about beating that fielder. The {{TEAM}} captain does so by opening the bat face ever so late to find the gap. Timed sweetly as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is immaculate placement from {{BATSMAN}}. He waits for the ball to arrive, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and guides it in between short third and backward point for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stand and deliver stuff from {{BATSMAN}}. Just flexes his arms and times the pants off this length ball. Races away through cover and no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, follows the bumper with a yorker and {{BATSMAN}} brings his bat down at the right time. Manages to get some wood off the cue end and the ball goes fine of the man at short third man. {{BOWLER}} is appealing! For what? Bat before the wicket? Was clearly off the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh this is not good from Siddarth Kaul. A good over is spoiled as he lets the ball slip through his hands at the boundary. Back of length, {{BATSMAN}} drags his pull through mid-wicket wide of the deep fielder. Should still have only been two at most. But Kaul couldn't get a hand on it while tumbling to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the airrrr and just wide of cover-point. It went just a yard or two away from Raina's outstretched left arm. Short and wide delivery, poor delivery, {{BATSMAN}} cuts uppishly and gets away with it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} has bowled exactly like he didn't need to. Got it right first ball but not this time. Pacy ball wide of off, and {{BATSMAN}}'s scorched it away through point. Free swing of the arms and poof, the ball disappears\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 134.3kph, short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} spots the length quickly, gets on top of the bounce and cuts through point. Perfectly placed between backward point and cover-point. First boundary of the match\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, perfect length, but it doesn't matter which variation it was, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and sweeps it hard to backward square leg for four. Incredible shot, and four...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, fraction too short from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to pick the length early, rocks back and pulls it over mid-wicket for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hangs back on that slower and wide ball to slam it off the front foot. Didn't preempt and got the gap on the off-side for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, successive fifties for {{BATSMAN}}. Moving up the order is certainly doing wonders for him. Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} camps back and cuts it through the gap at cover point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's poor from the fielder at short fine, too straight from {{BOWLER}}, on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads and he flicked it fine. Beat Ashwin's awkward dive and rolled away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} welcomes {{BOWLER}} with a superb drive. He makes a bit of room to open up the off-side field, {{BOWLER}} helps his cause by dishing it full, pumped through extra cover and wide of long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Does this man have wrists? Even the sub-continent players will be proud of this shot. Full delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} with his slight shuffle brings those wrists into play as he flicks it over mid-wicket. Couple of bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, full and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} needs no second invitation as he threw his hands at that, clears cover-point and races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, on a good length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, drives it on the up and splits the gap between cover and cover-point, rolls away to the fence in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Delhi have just lost a wicket, but that's not going to affect {{BATSMAN}}. He'll keep playing his shots. This was short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in his crease and cuts it past the man at short third man, four more..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, tad too short from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it and then flat-bats it wide of mid-on, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length delivery and has been helped off the hips again. Tucked past deep fine leg for a four. A strike-rate of 500 for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and into his right shoulder, and here's what {{BATSMAN}} does: Swivels and pulls it through fine leg. Life's ridiculously easy at times\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}}'s pacy puts {{BATSMAN}} in tangle once again but there is no one at fine leg. The man is in the ring. {{BATSMAN}} was hurried by the bumper and top edged the pull. And because he throws his bat so hard, these edges fly over the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another cracking shot to end the over. Backs away, makes room and crunches the overpitched delivery through cover-point for his third boundary of the over. The required run is down to 5 now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's what he was looking for all this time. Width on offer. {{BATSMAN}} lashes it away through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bangs the ball short and has been pulled away! There was no one at deep mid and it was a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a cracking shot. Width on offer and {{BATSMAN}} makes the most of it. Short and wide outside off, throws his bat at it and crunches it past the fielder at point, races away to the fence in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there is a thing called luck. But there is nothing called like a bowler's luck. He is always at the receiving end of things. It is a yorker, almost fells {{BATSMAN}} down. Cannot get his bat down in time but manages to put some willow on it. That is enough to deflect this to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot man! He is finding the gaps to perfection, moves across to the off-side and plays a cheeky little paddle over short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball, no room, {{BATSMAN}} opens his arms and carves it away past point. The man at sweeper cover dived to make the tackle but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that shot had class written all over it. He waited and waited for the ball to come and just opens the bat face at the last moment, timing was perfect and so was placement. Ball beats the short third man fielder for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a good lofted drive, but RPS have won by a massive 61 runs. This will lift their net run rate by some margin. Is that it then for {{TEAM}}? Maybe they still have an outside chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overcooks it now at full pace. {{BATSMAN}} opens his bat face and squeezes this between point and short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flighted on middle, there's no one at square leg and {{BATSMAN}} is quickly down on his knees to sweep him to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time {{BATSMAN}} is in position much quicker, the line is different too - more around off and middle - and he's able to muscle the pull away through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air and in the gap. {{BATSMAN}} gets down on one knee and plays against the turn. His slog sweep finds the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket. One bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, can't bowl such freebies to a batsman of this class. It's a juicy full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} brings his bat down in time and angles it past the fielder at point, he's toying with the field here, finding those gaps with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's done it again. He has done it again. Quite brilliant. Slower ball wide of off, and {{BATSMAN}} puts it over short third man's head. He's whisked into the 90s. Some player this lad\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh this is fantastic batting! Did they drop him for his bowling? Oh well well. Looks like we have Narine 2.0. Another half-volley outside off, this time it's lofted over the infield to the deep extra cover fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot! Right out of the coaching manual. Nothing much wrong with the delivery. Fuller and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and creams the drive past mid-off. Thakur can only fetch it from the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, quite an edgy start for the Kings. {{BATSMAN}} goes for an expensive drive against an outswinger and gets a thick outside edge. The ball flies over Guptill at wide slip and races away to the fence. Both batsmen have scored a boundaries but they haven't been convincing ones\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good shot. Sees the length short and pulls it up and over the infield. Clears it easily for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, creates room by going leg-sidish, got the room to expand his arms and then threads the ball away between cover and extra cover for back-to-back fours. Innovation and {{BATSMAN}} go hand in hand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh the punch. Walks down, gets behind the line, on top of the good length, and straight bats, down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary for {{BATSMAN}}. Short of length delivery and he did not have much space to free his arms, but manages to pull it over mid-wicket and the fast outfield does the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is becoming predictable here with his length. It was on a short of length again, {{BATSMAN}} holds his shape and pulls it over square leg for another four.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, too full and too wide of off from {{BOWLER}}, almost a half-volley length and {{BATSMAN}} can get under it on the drive - has enough power to clear mid-off and rolls away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what amazing placement! Flat one just outside off, not short at all, {{BATSMAN}} whips a cut between gully and backward point for four. Surgically bisected the field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top edge, but it flies high over QdK. Short fuller length on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was beaten for pace on the pull shot, gets away with it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 101kph, {{BOWLER}} fires one in the blockhole outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out to squeeze it away with a horizontal blade and gets a faint under edge. The ball goes through the legs of the keeper and runs away to the fence. {{BOWLER}} has his hands on his head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, over-corrects by overpitching outside off. {{BATSMAN}} won't miss those. Leans into the drive and caresses it through covers. Raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries. Length ball on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} hops across and flicks it very fine. Bhajji is slightly too square and he can't cut it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, some more. {{BOWLER}} decides to compensate, dragging in a half tracker. {{BATSMAN}}'s way too smart to see through these ploys .. stays back tall, heaving it away. And mid-wicket will only chase\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classy shot! Sublime stuff from {{BATSMAN}}, struck this punchy drive on the up and once he pierced the gap at cover, it was always racing along. It wasn't a bad ball to be honest, just one of those things this man can do when on song\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 110.4km/h slower one on a length with a bit of width, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it and unleashes the wrists - runs his hands through the slap through sweeper cover for four as Axar fails to cut it off with a dive...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Ayappa has misjudged it horribly. Short of length and {{BATSMAN}} pulls it to deep mid-wicket, Ayappa is late to charge in and then has to run back because the ball bounced in front of him, can only parry it over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act now. Full and straight, {{BATSMAN}} goes through the line and drills it straight down the ground. Smith had no chance of stopping that at mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 140ks, short and wide. What does {{BATSMAN}} do? No feet, just uses the leeway and forehand smacks it dead straight, over the umpire and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundary to end the over but {{BOWLER}} wouldn't mind - concedes only 8 runs in it. This was in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} heaves it into the vacant region at cow-corner. The fielder was perhaps inside the circle and that shall be four more for the all-rounder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, MS won't be happy with this effort. It was touch fuller of good length and there was just enough room, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat at it and creams the drive to mid-off. Shardul Thakur there misfields and it goes for a boundary to long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and he has the time to rub in some grace as well into this carnage. The full-faced punch down the pitch, which should ideally have been just a couple, but Russell just doesn't dive. Poor guy, he just can't\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh lovely. Third man is insi{{BATSMAN}} the ring and that is exactly why {{BATSMAN}} wants to give himself a bit of room. Short of a length {{BATSMAN}}livery outsi{{BATSMAN}} off stump, {{BATSMAN}} cracks the cut past backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 130kph. Just too straight, and this in no way is helping Rajasthan's cause here. {{BATSMAN}} won't complain though, surely not with fine leg in the circle, tickling it fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, here's the pick up. Vintage {{BATSMAN}}. Helped by an allying half volley on the pads at gentle pace and all he does with it is lovingly lofts his flick. All the timing and a bounce into the mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's quite the blooper from Mills at third man. He might have taken his eyes off and the ball sneaks through him and over the ropes. Nice little glide from {{BATSMAN}}, shouldn't have been anything more than a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 7th IPL fifty for Rishabh {{BATSMAN}}! The DD dug out is up and applauding this wondrous talent. Slightly short and he's laced all the power into the pull shot, raced away behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's an excellent shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Shortish and rising high, {{BATSMAN}} stood tall and cut it away over point, didn't bother to keep the ball down and it raced to the fence in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}}'s over is ruined once again off the last ball, this was tossed up nicely outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bent half-forward, reverses his stance and helps it on its way to the long leg fence, make it off the fifth ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, woeful from the fielder at cover, I think it's Uthappa. This was tossed up wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} reached out and crashed it towards cover. The ball bounced awkwardly in front of him and {{BATSMAN}} didn't get his body behind it either\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely paddled away, no fine leg, so he was aware of the field and was in position early to help it on its way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, two dots and {{BATSMAN}} breaks free. Flat and short down leg, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across and helps it behind square for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just too short. Also the googly going away from him helps, which {{BATSMAN}}'s quick to pounce on with a fierce cut. And there's no one at point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant! That's {{BATSMAN}}'s experience for you. This was a length delivery angled away from him and {{BATSMAN}} played it late in order to guide it down to third man, the fielder was too square to cut it off. 16 runs of the over, all in boundaries!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bosh. In the swinging arc for {{BATSMAN}} and he butchers it straight down the ground. Arrests his high backlift, again employs his bottom hand and bashes it straight down the ground. Watch out ump! Nearly knocked him out there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky and four, {{BATSMAN}} gets lucky and gets a boundary as well, comes down the track, doesn't get anywhere close to the ball, swings through the line, the big inside edge races away past the leg-stump and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pre-meditated and four. Knelt down and paddled it fine, beats the long chase and desperate dive of Corey Anderson at fine leg. Almost played it onto the stumps, but got it wide of de Kock\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 132.6km/h, that's a slower one, shortish and no width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} is asked to manufacture his own, and he does so byb moved away into the on-side and slapping it through the gap in the cover region to the deep extra cover fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, exposes all his stumps as he backs away, standing far outside leg-stump. {{BOWLER}} follows him but doesn't bowl it as close as he would have liked, {{BATSMAN}} cashes on the width and flays it away over point for a once-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a pick up shot and that has almost gone the distance. Angled in on off and middle, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it away powerfully. Roy like McCullum was straight at long-on, he can only pick the ball up from the boundary rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the best we have seen so far? Maybe! Is making room to this length ball, the length is just short of a length and hence decides to play a straight-bat punch. Times it well to beat mid-off to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that has {{BATSMAN}}'s swagger stamped all over it. Look at him making room, whilst stepping down the track, and smaking it flat-batted wide of Steven Smith at mid-off. Does put in a dive but that was motoring away. Not a chance, even with a dive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Oh dear! That's extremely poor from Shami - ran across from deep backward square leg, got close to the ball and then let it for the other fielder - in the end, both are nowhere close to the ball and it costs them a couple of extra runs, short and at the stumps, pulled away past square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, googly. But as if {{BATSMAN}} could care less, he's dancing down this time, making room for his arm and inside-outing it once again into that extra cover zone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}. It was short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets in position early and slaps it past point. The ball races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a poor ball from Sran, too full and on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, all he had to do was to get some bat on that, he does and beats fine leg with ease. Expensive start from Sran, 11 came from the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the bait that {{BATSMAN}} throws to the bowler - shuffles across to this inswinging ball and flicks through mid-wicket to get off the mark with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, juicy length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} had plenty of time and he takes full toll of it, lifts the drive over mid-off with an air of nonchalance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a french cut to get his first boundary. On a good length around off, shaping into the batsman. {{BATSMAN}} tries to fend it late and ends up getting an inside edge. Past the leg stump and all the way to the fence she goes, in a jiffy.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, de Kock apologizes as he makes a mess of it. Should have been stopped by him, but instead it's four byes. The boundaries are leaking and Royals wouldn't mind it. {{BATSMAN}} was looking to guide the slower delivery through third man but got beaten due to the lack of pace. The keeper couldn't gather it cleanly as he parried it away to the fence in the process\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball again, the batsman does not time the pull away. But he gets enough meat on it and sends it past mid-on for a four. Fifty up for {{TEAM}}. All carnage at Mohali\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR .. and {{TEAM}} have officially arrived. 19 off this over, with a forehand smash down the ground. He made room, made sure he was on top of the the in-angling short one and muscled it wide of mid-on. It's {{BOWLER}}'s birthday, and this is the equivalent of birthday bumps ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what an over this is turning out to be! 18 already with 2 balls to go. He errs in line with this slower ball, gets it full on middle and leg and {{BATSMAN}} whips it wide of deep mid-wicket. The ball sneaks through the fielder as he slides across. Warner isn't happy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the free-hit and it has been smashed away, high full-toss on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he pulled it without much timing, but the placement was good, past square leg and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky runs for {{BATSMAN}}. Has a wry smile after that. Slogs across the line and gets a thick inside edge past the keeper. Wasn't far away from the stumps either\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the runs are leaking. Short of a length on the leg stump, poor line with not much of protection behind square on the on-side, {{BATSMAN}} pulls and sends it to the long leg boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, juicy. Full, easily down leg, and all {{BATSMAN}} has to do is tickle - but he swings, middles his sweep behind square powerfully\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot! Slower short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} pulls it in front of square, the best thing was he rolled his wrist to keep it in the gap and bisect the two fielders in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's been muscled through long-on. Going against {{BOWLER}}'s angle from over the wicket and going through the line. One bounce and into the ropes. Just the 16 needed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shouldn't have given him the third over. {{BOWLER}} is become a touch predictable now. Overcompensates by going too full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} creams it through covers for an elegant boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flashes at this googly turning away from him and the edge zooms over slip. Dhawan barely had any time to get his hands up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that shall release some nerves in the {{TEAM}} camp. Pitched on a full length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out for it by leaning ahead and creams it through extra cover as the ball races away in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, treat to watch! Good length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets into good position and drives it sumptuously through cover, raced away all along the carpet\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good shot to get off the mark. In-drifter, slightly errs in line. Too straight and {{BATSMAN}}'s wrists does the rest. Flicks it through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, very full and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets his left leg out of the way and plays a pristine straight drive - past Rahul and beyond Pollard's reach - running across from long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and the mid-wicket fence is disturbed again. This time courtesy a standing up pull. Overcompensates the full toss with a pepper and {{BATSMAN}} - just what {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for. Rides the bounce with a toe-rise and dispatches\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, again. Once more {{BOWLER}} fires it across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} still does not get the connection right on the dab, races away fine off the under edge and no chance for short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another off-speed ball, full and on the stumps at 123.3kph from wide of the crease. {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and hoists it over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a defensive drag down. {{BATSMAN}} stays tall, picks his widely open cow corner. And whips. Splitting the men converging to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot. Should settle {{BATSMAN}}'s nerves, if any. Shortish ball wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of it and cuts it fiercely through the off-side, beating the man at backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mid-on chases...chases...chases and the ball wins the race. Not quite off the middle, but {{BATSMAN}} will take it. Slogs a length ball across the line to the right of mid-on where Siddarth Kaul comes second in the race\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 'I am not going to change! That's how I play, that's how I will today as well...' Not my words but this shot from {{BATSMAN}} suggests that. Steps down and cracks the drive past cover, gave himself a bit of room to help with the flow of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drilled straight back, goes right through {{BOWLER}} and then sneaks through Rayudu as well. Clumsy sliding effort at long-on there, but considering his bruised knee, we'll cut him some slack\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overpitches. There's no one straight down in the deep, and {{BATSMAN}} easily gets under this one to go over, typically\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's brilliant cricket. {{BATSMAN}} moved across early and {{BOWLER}} followed him with a full toss, but the batsman adjusted and scooped it over short fine, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's over mid-on. And comfortably. Seam-up back of a length ball that allows {{BATSMAN}} a cross-batted swat. Not right out of the middle but the shot thrust meant that it cleared the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tosses it up slow on middle and leg. Overpitched as well. {{BATSMAN}} waits for the ball and drills it down the track. No chance for the long-on fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, punched away off the back foot with a slightly horizontal bat. Stays forward and takes care of the shortish ball. Not too short and the batsman thumped the ball away. He is in good form\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is poor bowling. Even the experienced {{BOWLER}} feeling the heat. Sprays it down leg and all {{BATSMAN}} had to do was place it in the gap, tickled fine and the fielder at 45 had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is poor bowling from {{BOWLER}}. He's just not finding his lines right. For the umpteenth time, drifts it down leg. Bread and butter for {{BATSMAN}}, who picks it away over short fine leg. Behrendorff leaps but it comfortably clears him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, trying too much? I guess so. Looks for swing again, there's none. Sat up from a short length, {{BATSMAN}} punches sweetly through the covers. Save your legs!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} reached out and cracks it in front of square on the off-side. Rahane moved across to his left, put in the dive, but the ball was always wide of him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} welcomes {{BOWLER}} with a four. It was a good length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to cut it wide of backward point, gets an outside edge and it races fine of third man for a boundray\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful from {{BATSMAN}} as he clears the front leg and lifts this delivery over extra cover. Great timing on it to beat long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the slog-sweep, in the air, but {{BATSMAN}} has split the fielders in the deep. Deep mid-wicket and deep backward square leg thought they were in the business for a moment. {{BATSMAN}} got down low on his knees and timed it well enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's in some mood tonight - tad too full and well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets underneath it and then scoops it over extra-cover, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a gift and {{BATSMAN}} ain't missing out. Loopy full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} does not do anything fancy, uses his power to drive it past extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not where he intended, but {{TEAM}} will take any run now. They have become like golddust. Quicker around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the steer and chops it off the under edge, nutmegs Karthik and runs away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that line was not going to work for long, especially with third man in. Angled outside off and {{BATSMAN}} uses that smartly to steer a boundary behind point - splitting backward point and short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the edge just eludes a flying Stokes at backward point. Nice and full from {{BOWLER}}, drawing {{BATSMAN}} across into a drive. The ball holds its line slightly to take a thick outside edge. Such a good effort from Stokes. Can't get a hand though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, geee, that's beaten everyone! Comedy of errors really. {{BATSMAN}} went for premeditated paddle, de Kock anticipated and was en route to his left already but guess what, the stroke didn't connect and the ball went through the yawning gap between first slip and the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beats Russell's sprint. Another example of how quick this outfield is. Even the fastest runner in KKR couldn't reach anywhere close to this. Was a short delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was quick to rock back and crack it to the wide of long-off. That boundary will spoil {{BOWLER}}'s over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and again.. {{BOWLER}} became predictable there. {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for the short of length stuff, he strikes this much better than the last one and it almost goes the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hence proven: Guptill has spring in his shoes. Hey ICC, are you watching? Cut but it's more off the edge, thanks to the bounce, and Guptill has almost gotten to it at backward point. Well almost. My commentary has been adulterated by my fanboyism, so maybe. But he really jumped there, and tumbling as he fell on the ground. Good to watch but {{BATSMAN}} gets four runs here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, MS won't be happy with this effort. It was touch fuller of good length and there was just enough room, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat at it and creams the drive to mid-off. Shardul Thakur there misfields and it goes for a boundary to long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the usual trick. But conventional this time. Sweeps with all his muscle and his big bat has it in it to almost take it all the way over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fired in quick outside off, lots of width on offer. {{BATSMAN}} treks back and punishes it with a punch. The mid-off fielder dived and got a hand to it. But the power off {{BATSMAN}}'s bat ensured it crossed the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, has been an exhibition of finesse by {{BATSMAN}} so far... It's not about power always. A floated delivery down the leg side and it's been lapped down to the fine leg boundary by Sanju. He's moved on to 26 off 11 balls\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that should make him feel better. {{BOWLER}} errs in his line here - just outside off and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to latch on, he moves back in the crease and caresses the punch through cover-point. All timing!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, down the track to ram the ball down the ground. He didn't quite get to the pitch of it as {{BOWLER}} saw him coming, but went through the line regardless. Beats mid-on comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nails the sweep. {{BATSMAN}} gets out a big stride, and then does well to roll his wrists on the ball as he powers it away despite the slight kick up off the pitch - keeping it down and into square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act now. {{BOWLER}} pitches it teasingly just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends low and goes for a cross-batted down-town swing. Picks the gap at long-on and it's a boundary..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow. Wow. What a front foot punch that is. Just a checked punch and look at the ball race away. Extra-cover was wi{{BATSMAN}} open and it raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is batting of the highest class from Jos {{BATSMAN}}! Steps outside leg to create room and lifts it nonchalantly over extra cover. The timing on that takes cares of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, over extra cover again. This time it's close to the bottom of his bat, so doesn't have enough power to clear the ropes. But it does have enough power to clear the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just short of backward square leg! For a moment, the fielder in the ring thought he had a chance but it bounced in front of him and sneaked through. Once it got past him, the outfield did the rest. Short of a length ball that {{BATSMAN}} pulled without bothering to keep it down. Fortunate that it didn't go to hand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, attempted yorker from {{BOWLER}} turns out into a low full-toss. {{BATSMAN}} presents the full face of the bat and punches it back past the non-striker, beats mid-on and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the airrr, Southee was at mid-on, runs back but only manages to fingertip it to the boundary. Clever batting from {{BATSMAN}}, he lofted that deliberately in the air knowing there was no one in the deep, {{BOWLER}} bowled very full this time and paid the price. {{BATSMAN}} went back and across for this ball, he went so deep in his crease that he would have been out hit wicket had he been in line with the stumps\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sits back deep in the crease to a slower ball, getting in a great position to dispatch it through midwicket. That brings up his fifty, just the boost in confidence he needed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not off the middle at all but {{BATSMAN}} will take it. Has been struggling to force the pace tonight. Shortish and wide, throws his hands on the cut and toe-ends it. Well wide of de Kock and very fine to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, blasted away! Doesn't matter where you bowl to him when he is in this mood. Banged in short by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} was down the track in a flash, flat-batted it powerfully past the Kiwi who did well to get out of the way. Rockets past mid-off who was in the ring. Incredible, simply incredible\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ah! That should have been either a single or a couple. Length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swung across the line and makes good connection. Simmons at long leg, slides across and makes contact with the rope while he had the ball in his hand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just wide of mid-off! 135.4kph, shortish ball, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to flat bat it over mid-off. Got it off the top part of the bat and wasn't in control of his shot. Fortunately for him, it beat Narine to his right and the ball raced away to the long-off fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, on a good length and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets a big stride forward and lifts it over the head of the man at mid-off, couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done by {{BATSMAN}}! Expensive over from {{BOWLER}}. 19 runs off it. It can be a match-changing over. It was short and was aimed on the body, {{BATSMAN}} gently clips it wide of the keeper for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundaries in succession. {{BATSMAN}} finally gets one right. {{BOWLER}} bowled a shortish delivery and his team mate did well to connect his pull, beats the diving fielder at deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, round the wicket, angles it in, {{BATSMAN}} was already setting up for this - dances down the track and lofts it inside out towards the deep extra cover fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh my. That's a punch, a ramp and an upper cut all in one. {{BOWLER}} looks to climb onto his neck. A typical Caribbean back footed stride and an open batted punch to race it through the cordon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, su-sweet. Ends the over with a boundary. Juicy half-volley from {{BOWLER}}, well outside off. {{BATSMAN}} isn't sparing those. Leans across, plants his front foot towards the ball and slashes it through extra cover. Beats a crowed off-side field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker and {{BATSMAN}} is in no mood to let him off, doesn't bother to get his front leg in line with the delivery, just goes through the line and smacks it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full, {{BATSMAN}} bludgeons it back over the bowler's head. There's no stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a shot! Mid-off up, the length had to be a tad short but {{BATSMAN}} is ready for it. Stands tall and flat-bats this wide of mid-off. Lovely connection and it's raced away. Much-needed momentum for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what wrists from {{BATSMAN}} as he whips this through square leg. Back of a length around off, shovels it with the bottom hand, hurries to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, juicy. He's in some weird mood, happy to go horizontally right away, gets that length that sits up, hoping to be smacked. Obliged. Airy over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, advances down close to the pitch and hammers it down the ground, with {{BOWLER}} having to duck for cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball and punished. {{BATSMAN}} picks it up early and nails the pull in front of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there you go! There's no stopping. MS knows when to fancy his chances, cross-seam delivery with lot of room on offer, he cashes on the the opportunity as he slashes the cut behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rank long hop from {{BOWLER}}. Gets what it deserves. {{BATSMAN}} rocks on the back foot and pulls it hard along the ground. Splits deep backward square leg and deep mid-wicket to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, doesn't get it where he intended, however still collects a boundary. Back of a length delivery, holds up a touch on the pitch and {{BATSMAN}} is through his pull short early. Ends up trimming it off the cue-end past mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that has been muscled - {{BATSMAN}} making his intentions clear - fetched a well flighted delivery from outside off and heaved it wide of mid-wicket - the fielder at long-on can't get across in time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nails the reverse. Switches grips, turns around, sits down and creams the broom behind square. A whistler this\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the line-looser. Ends up with a freebie going down leg and all he does it get some of his swat on it to take it past the keeper. That's all he had to do. A graceful acceptance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful touch. Slower ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} uses the wide gap between backward point and short third to direct the ball there. {{BOWLER}} perhaps gave {{BATSMAN}} too much room outside off to play that shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just a chip shot from {{BATSMAN}} but he has timed it to perfection. And has placed it well too. It will beat the straight fielders for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashes the ball away again. Shortish ball and has been pulled away past deep mid for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boom! That's a fierce slap from {{BATSMAN}}. Suddenly, it's raining boundaries for {{TEAM}}. Very full and overpitches in the process just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} conserves some energy by wielding his bat and creams the drive through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classic {{BATSMAN}}! Takes a forward stride and flicks this one effortlessly through mid-wicket. All about timing, yet again. Not for the first time has DK timed it so well, have been quite a few in this innings so far\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flies off the outside edge over short third man! Full ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swings for the rafters, only just reaching it with the toe-end and slicing it into the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary for {{BATSMAN}}! That was a good ball from {{BOWLER}}. He bowled a sharp bouncer attacking the head of the batsman. {{BATSMAN}}, who almost took his eye off it, wasn't afraid to go with his hook shot. Came right off the middle of the middle in the end. One bounce into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is in the zone today. He is seeing the ball well and has the awareness of the field. Makes room to this short delivery and pulls it well over the infield. The ball bounces just once before crashing into the ad boards\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is pouncing on anything short. He opens up his stance slightly to give himself enough leverage on the off-side, jumps back and clatters it past extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is away. Sees the width and throws his bat, gets an outside edge that flies past first slip. Would've been gobbled up by second slip, if there was ever one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 141ks garnered with a hint of width, {{BATSMAN}} feasts on it with a smacking cut past the diving left hand of backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, errs in line this time, short and angling into the body, DK rolls his wrists and nails the pull through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, width now. Nothing going Bangalore's way. The length isn't either. A friendly sit up and smashed away with a flaying cut. Reintroduced into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not entirely in control but gets the result. Another slower ball variation from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} is early into the slog. Skies it high towards deep mid-wicket but it's in the gap. Finds the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the two men behind square on the on-side are in the ring and hence {{BATSMAN}} goes for the sweep. This is what he tried on the first ball as well, this time connects and fetches a four to the deep backward square leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not off the meat of the bat. But still runs away to the fence. Was angled across around off and {{BATSMAN}} drove from the crease; toe-ended but had enough to get it past the fielders near the cover region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, makes room to a length delivery on the stumps and swipes it over the infield, clears cover-point and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball down the leg side and {{BATSMAN}} drags it past the fielder at short fine leg, sends it to the fence and adds four more to his tally\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, backs away and blasts it past mid-off for a four. That was on a length, {{BATSMAN}} backed away, created room and allowed his hands to do the needful\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundaries continue to flow.. Even {{BOWLER}} has conceded two in the over. A venomless short delivery that sits up for the Englishman, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and pulls it over the square leg umpire. No protection in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slightly short, {{BATSMAN}} quickly responds by jumping back on the cut. But it's not really that short. So he's not in control, gets a thick outside edge and it runs away through the vacant slip region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off the blocks in a jiffy. Not that bad a ball, just a superb shot. Was on a length around off, he shuffled across and clipped it away sweetly through mid-wicket. Once again, outstanding timing on the shot. Nothing much you can do as a bowler except applaud the batsman\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets off the mark with a glorious off-drive. Gets hold of the overpitched delivery, presents the full face of his willow and creams it past the fielder at mid-off. Great shot to open his account\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, an on-drive with a straight bat is one of the hardest shots to play in our sport. But how insanely easy {{BATSMAN}} made it look. Class, sheer class! He comes on the front foot and drives it past mid-on for another four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lifted over the infield! One of {{BATSMAN}}'s go-to shots in the powerplay. Stands tall this time to the good length ball and carves it over cover. More off the cue-end really but he's got enuugh power to clear the field and it trickles away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, turning out to be just the over {{TEAM}} needed. Kohli is furious at long-off. Kicks the ball back onto the ad boardings. Pitched up and {{BATSMAN}} slams it straight down the ground. No chance for Kohli at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rubbish ball and {{BATSMAN}} will feast on these all day. Gets a drag on around middle and leg, sits on the back foot and nails the pull through square leg. Found the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is the twist. THIS IS THE TWIST. {{BATSMAN}}'s cut loose, freeing up his hands and slicing this into the sightscreen straight down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, makes plenty of room outside off and smears {{BOWLER}} over extra cover. It was a slower ball that was bowled into the pitch which gave enough time for {{BATSMAN}} to pick his spot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy. Don't bother. When you have such good hands, just put bat to ball. Short of a length, sat up wide of off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} flays it over point. Period.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dug in short and {{BATSMAN}} fetched the pull from outside off, not off the meat but the key thing was he got it in the gap, between deep mid-wicket and long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this one is even better. Full length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches for it and slaps it through the gap at extra-cover. The fielders on the off side had hardly any time to react\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundary to end the over! That'll spoil his first over. Bowls a low full toss outside off and {{BATSMAN}} carves it through the gap at covers. The outfield does the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, change of pace from {{BOWLER}}, but {{BATSMAN}} spotted it well, waited on the short ball, rolled his wrists and helped it behind square on the on-side, beat short fine and raced away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, byes, FOUR, that's an awful delivery! A beamer that beats {{BATSMAN}}'s pull and also beats Buttler. Five bonus runs for Delhi, more importantly the next ball is a free-hit!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, precise placement from captain {{BATSMAN}}. Floaty chinaman turning in around off, {{BATSMAN}} stays low and plays the half sweep/pull, in the air and bisecting the two fielders in front of square on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} knows only way! The aggressive way. Sees the width on offer and slices the shortish delivery over point. Enough wood on it as the ball races away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, makes room, creates his own width and smashes the length delivery through covers. Simple cricket!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, power, brute power! Full, outside off and slammed between deep cover and deep long-off for a four. Whatta shot!!! {{BATSMAN}} absolutely drilled that. {{BOWLER}} missed the wide yorker not by much\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, still short, and worse, wide too. {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands out quickly to slice it away with a lot of power over backward point. Okay, he's officially in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clobbered by {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} went round the wicket to cramp up the batsman, but provided the ideal length for the Aussie to hit, brutalised past the stumps at the other end. The ball was gone before {{BOWLER}} could stick his boot in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, raining boundaries! Cannot understand this ploy though, back of a length outside off with third man in the ring. {{BATSMAN}} stays back and glides it, just had to beat that man in the 30-yard circle and he does it with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he doesn't want to get his eye in, does {{BATSMAN}}. It was in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} and he smashes it over deep mid-wicket. Not timed as well as he would have liked. So, it didn't go over the ropes but will fetch him a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, we have seen brute power from gayle earlier but this is total touch play from {{BATSMAN}}. It was a good length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets in a good position and drives it on the up, ball beats the mid-off fielder for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, right up under {{BATSMAN}}'s bat and he punches it fiercely over mid-on. A full ball on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} opens his stance up, gets his front leg out of the way and times it nicely\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short from {{BOWLER}}, can't bowl those at his pace. {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} leans into the ball and cracks it in front of square on the off-side, splits the gap past point and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Just a flick of the wrists and Rinku Singh, one of the quick movers, could not get around to stop it. Dances down and gets to the pitch, whipped against the turn to wide long-on, the timing was exquisite\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery from {{BOWLER}}. Rank long hop and {{BATSMAN}} had all the time in world to pick his spot, transfers his weight on the back foot and slots the pull past square leg, no chance for the man in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crisply struck! Another delightful shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Overpitched and he is well forward to this one, times the straight drive with aplomb to send it racing past the right of mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is what pressure does - a fumble from Rabada and he concedes three extra runs to {{BATSMAN}} - on a good length and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} nudged it in front of mid-on and charged across for a quick single - so did Rabada and he took his eyes off the ball, slipped underneath and rolled away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picks the bones out of this disguise. The literacy means that he reads the slower one, waits on it and mows it through mid-wicket. A serious move on this\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, down leg. And dealt with a nurdle off the thighs. Going past the glance and runs away into the long leg ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 110.9kph, ah, Djoker! The change up finally goes wrong. AB reads the long hop, stands up full height and forehands it insi{{BATSMAN}}-out over extra cover. It's his fifty too -- 30th\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky and four, short of a length and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was backing away on the pull, gets a thick inside edge that flies over the top of leg-stump\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finally connects one! A tossed up delivery on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it to arrive and powers is past {{BOWLER}}. Straight as an arrow as this one races away to the fence in double quick time..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, nicely done by {{BATSMAN}}, this was the drifter that was angled down leg, he bent down, used the pace on the ball and lapped it behind square on the on-side for a boundary, 23 from the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, climbs from a back of a length, finds the outside edge pretty high up on the bat and runs away to the third man boundary. {{BATSMAN}} was driving on the up there. Highly ambitious\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no third man. Nor there is short third. Easy shot for {{BATSMAN}}. He reverse-swats the length ball turning away from him wide of backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's no point, literally. But {{BOWLER}} dishes out width off a shortened length and allows Sharma to go behind and cut it square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fine shot from {{BATSMAN}}! Width on offer and although the length isn't very full, his hands do the rest as he powers this through extra cover. Finds the gap perfectly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short and too wide from {{BOWLER}}, that's a loosener and that's been put away with ease. Had to reach out - {{BATSMAN}}, but he got on top of the bounce and found the gap past cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that was four the moment it was hit. A good length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to camp back and punch it away. Beats the fielder at extra cover and the man at sweeper cover too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length del - doesn't matter - {{BATSMAN}} gets on his knee, bows his head down, and absolutely nails the scoop over the gaping 'keeper to the long stop fence for a one-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no it gets better. Some width in the float up, {{BATSMAN}} crouches, with his rubber wrists, whisking it through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sits up from back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} had all the time in the world to pick his spot; swivels and muscles the pull behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dipping full delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} moves across, waits for the ball to arrive and then drills it hard past extra cover. No chance for the sweeper to get across and stop it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, if being short was bad, this one's wide outside off as well. And for {{BATSMAN}}, it's a toy around. He walks back in the crease, waits for it to get close and times his cut perfectly backward of point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's absolutely crashed this through extra-cover. A full, wide ball with mid-off up. Not sure what the thinking is. Whatever it is, the execution of it is way off target. Misses the yorker by a long way and {{BATSMAN}} pummels the drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fine delivery that didn't deserve a boundary. Short delivery right under the batsman's throat, {{BATSMAN}} was backing away and was hurried on the pull, the top-edge flies away fine, one bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} rolled his wrists on the cut and got it down, beats extra cover and gets another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short again from {{BOWLER}}, and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't need to get his eye in to dispatch it. He rocks back and thwacks it wide of deep midwicket. Not the follow-up MI needed after that Chahar over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, kind of a shot batsman would salivate on for days. Wow from {{BATSMAN}}! It was on a good length and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and punches it off the backfoot. It beats the cover fielder and races to the fence on this rapid outfield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the edges spoil the over. The scrambled leg-cutter this from Watto with a hint of width as well. {{BATSMAN}} gets his drive around 90-degrees finer than he had planned. Off the outside edge and through the vacant cordon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time he connects with the sweep, he actually played this with one hand. This line is a little more straighter than the previos one, {{BATSMAN}} hits the big gap at deep backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's all happening for the Kings XI Punjab, a miscue, a steepling top-edge and Iyer off all people has made a mess of it. Could this be the pivotal moment of the game? Banged in short and Mayank got into a poor position on the pull, was cramped for room and all he managed was a thick leading edge over mid-wicket, went high and down towards the rope. Iyer came running across from the deep, did all the hard yards, got both hands and let it burst through - to add insult to injury, it rolled over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, quite a start from {{BATSMAN}} who effortlessly lofts {{BOWLER}} on the up over extra cover, with no one back at the boundary there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, luck's written all over that delivery. A peach of an inswinger from {{BOWLER}}, bowled at 139ks and nearly cut {{BATSMAN}} into half. Was caught poking around the fifth stump channel and the inside edge flies wide of PP to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, how well did {{BATSMAN}} read this leg break? This was tossed up well outside off and spun away, {{BATSMAN}} gets a big stride forward, plays with the turn and goes inside out over cover, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} and Punjab are away. Takes a step forward, manufactures his own room and thrashes it over cover. Kings XI anthem blares in the background\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that shot proves how good a form {{BATSMAN}} is in. Was a shortish delivery outside off, Robbie makes the width on offer and chops it past the fielder at point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more flight, this time drifting wide outside off. {{BATSMAN}} moves the other way, piling on the overcook to carve it away through sweeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky! That is what you get with {{BATSMAN}}. On a length and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} opens the bat face at the last second and runs it fine, beating third man in the deep comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot! {{BATSMAN}} has used the angle of {{BOWLER}} to superb effect. Slanted across the right hander outside off, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and lofts it handsomely over extra cover, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, front leg is already out of the way, and this fuller delivery goes for a four. Just moved a little to the off-stump and opened his torso side-on, and goes through with the flat mow through long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length delivery wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front-leg and drags it from outside off, clubs it away flat and wide of mid-off to the wide long-on fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half tracker and {{BATSMAN}} pounces on it. It was the carrom ball and turning away, {{BATSMAN}} rocked back and slapped it in front of square, no chance for the man sweeping\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, with mid-wicket inside the ring, the pull is a safe shot. That is if you get it right. {{BATSMAN}} was almost cramped for room, but got the pull high on the bat and placed it to the left of mid-wicket. No chance for long-on to cut it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good shot to get off the mark. Hint of width on this short of length and that's enough for {{BATSMAN}}. He is quick to trek back and employ the cut shot behind square. Finds the gap and fetches his first boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot! Brings up the 150. Half volley and not many batsmen miss out. {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and pumps the drive through extra cover. No one at sweeper cover to stop it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, loosener from Rahman and {{BATSMAN}} puts it away with ease. Stand and deliver stuff. Short, wide and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} says thank you very much and bashes it through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has dispatched it for a boundary. It is a No-ball too, it was a full-toss above the waist height, {{BATSMAN}} pumps it wide of fine leg for a boundary. Free-hit!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 138.4kph. Too full, {{BATSMAN}} does well going inside-out with his slice over backward point .. but Kaul runs across from third man, gets the slide in as well, but probably ends up slipping with the dew, slipping all over it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is batting practice for Steven {{BATSMAN}}. He had all the time in the world to smash this slower length ball outside off and smash it he does. Clears his front leg and clobbers it wide of the fielder at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker. This is rare from India's number-one bowler. {{BATSMAN}} has got his touch back and he punches it wide of long-off for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, almost another. {{BATSMAN}} after getting squared up thanks to the nagging angle being created out here just throws his bat up looking to cut the ball away. Races away off the top-edge and flies through the hands of slip. Rohit the man out there. Too quick for the classification to come under a drop\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rubbing insult. A nothing half tracker, drifting down leg and {{BATSMAN}} loads up on the back foot, swivelling as he swats it powerfully behind square. One-bounced\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, action replay of the previous ball and that has been powered away through the covers. The man at sweeper cover despite not having to cover a lot to his right, ends up being a spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy pickings! Back of a length on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} waits and gently tickles it fine, the man is inside the ring at 45 and it was well wide of him, raced across the lightning outfield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off and running. {{BOWLER}} pitches it up just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} with all his bottom-hand power slaps it fiercely past mid-off. Brute force from the skip!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and punished! {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for it and slaps it towards long-on as the ball almost goes the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot! Sweet sound on that blow. Full length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out and crunches this one through the gap at cover. Was in the air for a while but no fielder was anywhere near\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 137.7kph. Turns cheeky. {{BOWLER}} tries to correct, getting the channel close to off, but {{BATSMAN}}'s not getting foxed. He stays back, arches and ramps it ever so late, teasing the man at short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, almost another! On a good length and well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} was leaning on the drive, the ball held up slightly and hits him high on the bat - went in the air and just wide of Tiwary at extra-cover, beats mid-off and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower half-volley outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets to the pitch of it and thrashes it away between mid-off and extra cover. Simple\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full ball targetting the sticks and the batsman got enough wood on it to clip it away. The man from deep square who was Binny came running in to make the save but despite getting a hand on it, couldn't bend down enough to stop that. Second four of the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, this is excellent cricket from {{BATSMAN}}, fraction too short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, opens the face of the bat and runs it past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, waits on the slower ball and cuts it at the last possible second. Bhuvi at third man runs to his right and puts in a dive, couldn't quite get his body behind the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} ends the over with a boundary and moves closer to his fifty. Gets a full toss and the southpaw makes sure to chip it over the infield at covers. No fielders in the deep and that's an easy four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, a pre-meditated paddle from {{BATSMAN}}, got down low, waited on the ball and then scooped it over fine leg's head, the fielder was inside the ring and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length and width, that's a harmful combo to serve in the powerplay; {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out. Pounces on it with a wielding willow and hits the gap with an air of authority\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed! The crowd are slowly finding their voices again. Flighted just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drives it down the ground. How hard did he strike that? He didn't bother to run, that sums it up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, takes strike after sometime but that doesn't deter him from getting a four. Jumped on to the short ball and pulled it away towards deep mid for a four. Played it in front of square and got it in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, excellent batting. On a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes up and over cover, once he got it through the infield the result was going to be in his favour\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, french-cut from {{BATSMAN}} and it almost shaved the off-stump. Nervy times for the South African these. This good length {{BATSMAN}}livery nipped in a bit and {{BATSMAN}} was cramped for room as he went for the cut - too close for comfort. Thick insi{{BATSMAN}} edge goes teasingly past the stumps to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too easy! Drifting down leg on a length and all {{BATSMAN}} had to do help it on its way, he sits on one knee and scoops it fine of the keeper to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh poor finish to the spell from {{BOWLER}}. Lands the googly outside leg and is punished. {{BATSMAN}} grounds his back knee to sweep it over short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} wastes no time in getting away. Backs away to this flatter ball, to make room, and bashes it through the covers. {{TEAM}} are away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time he goes fuller, and a little bit wider outside off, and allows {{BATSMAN}} the room to free his arms. He's quickly onto the back knee to sweep it away through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this pocket-sized dynamite is exploding and taking CSK down to the smithereens here. Reverse swept over backward point for a four. He is in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, steered and just wide of the Raina at wide slip. A short of length delivery with width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} opens his bat-face at the last moment and guided it to Raina's right, who dived full length. Trickles away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}} and he's away, the slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, it was a back of a length delivery as well, {{BATSMAN}} spotted it early, got on top of the bounce and punched it through cover. Krunal Pandya gave the chase, but the ball sped away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the plan was right from {{BOWLER}}, almost had {{BATSMAN}} in trouble but somehow the batsman manages to help it away towards the fine leg fence. Bouncer following {{BATSMAN}}, who was moving to leg and he gets cramped for all room because of the spicy bounce but {{BATSMAN}} manages get it away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pulled or tucked? Decide for yourself. Was very wristy though as he got hold of the short ball and just gave it direction to get it past short fine leg. That scorched away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mid-off is up so {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg in order to go over the infield. It's a short of length delivery from {{BOWLER}}, not the ideal ball to hit straight down the ground, but {{BATSMAN}} had his mind made up. He flat-bats it hard enough, and although it came off the toe-end, it's enough to go over the fielder. Cutting gives good chase and tries hauling it back in with a slide, but his foot was in contact with the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Gayle who? 144.7km/h, all of it in vain because it's a half-volley outside off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't move his feet and plays a transfer of weight drive between extra cover and long-off for four!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more helicopter. A more-standing one here, staying up on the back foot and the power imparted on it is enough to whack it once again wide of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a hint of flight, pretty good length, on off stump, {{BATSMAN}} gets down the wicket and lofts it nonchalantly towards long-on for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, prodigious movement for {{BOWLER}}. Pitched up and late shape away for {{BOWLER}} just outside off. {{BATSMAN}} goes after it, hard hands and gets a thick outside edge which eludes Bhajji at short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss again and this time he lofts it over extra-cover. Although the timing isn't quite there, he just had to clear the fielder in the circle. No chance for the fielder running across from sweeper cover. It's fifty for {{BATSMAN}} too. The crowd going bonkers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery to start off. Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches for it and punches it firmly through the gap at cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, {{BATSMAN}} is getting into his groove now. Comes down the track, doesn't get close to the ball, that allows him to free his arms and drill it back past the umpire, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss and he's lofted that with such calmness. No real rush to power that ball, just placed it perfectly back over the ump's head and no chance for the men in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just wide of Tye's outstretched hands running to his left from deep mid-wicket. Had a lot of work to do but was never really going to get to it. Slower ball on a shortish length and {{BATSMAN}} went for the forehand smash. Mistimed it but luckily, got it in the gap. Or nearly in the gap. Doesn't matter how they come as long as they do\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, emergency, emergency! The bowlers are being thrashed, someone send an ambulance. Maxi is putting up a clinic. This is some batting. {{BOWLER}} bowls it straight, marmalized wide of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hangs back for the flighted short ball and then hacks it well past the man at mid-on for a four. He packs a punch in every shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done! Ample time for {{BATSMAN}} to pick his spot. Normal-paced shortish ball, no venom in it. {{BATSMAN}} slightly crouches and elevates it over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, three boundaries and three dots in the over - the length was wide once again, {{BATSMAN}} threw the kitchen sink on the drive, gets a thick edge that flies through the vacant slip cordon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, make that 24 off the over, length ball on the pads and it's flicked away disdainfully past short fine. RCB need time to breathe and they call for a strategic break\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is an ordinary effort from Siraj at long-on. And he gifts a boundary to {{BATSMAN}}. It was on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} flicks it wide of long-on. Siraj at long-on was clumsy in the deep and he lets it through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, angling in and short enough for {{BATSMAN}} to dismiss it off his sight with a carcking pull over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the slip was there for {{BATSMAN}}'s first ball. But he was taken off for this one and guess what the ball goes right through that gaping hole. Good delivery from {{BOWLER}}, hitting a length and getting bounce, the edge was found but there was no-one to catch and it runs away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Fuller and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and creams the drive past cover-point, Nadeem ran behind the ball and only managed to escort it to the fence. The dive never came\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! He has muscled it. With mid-on inside the cirlce, that's a safe shot. Backs away a tad and tonks this fullish delivery over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, fraction too short from {{BOWLER}} , {{BATSMAN}} is quick to rock back and pulls it through mid-wicket, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and again. {{BOWLER}} is shortish again and on seeing that {{BATSMAN}} retreats, opens the face of the bat on the punch and cracks it through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor line by {{BOWLER}}. Can't bowl such freebies to a batsman in such fine form. Down the leg side and {{BATSMAN}} sweeps it away to the fine leg fence. Fielder is nowhere close to cut this down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} needs to keep going for {{TEAM}}. The runs have dried up a bit in the last few overs. Trifle short and outside off and {{BATSMAN}} waits before playing the cut shot past the diving backward point fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, second boundary and it is to the same area. This was not on leg-stump, but straight enough for {{BATSMAN}} to glance it wristily past short fine leg, just used the pace on the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, room on offer and {{BATSMAN}} makes the most of it. Adjusted well as he rose high to flay it past a diving backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now {{BOWLER}} bangs it short, this is not a WACA to trouble batsmen with bounce, sits up nicely, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and doesn't bother to keep the ball along the ground as he pulls through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is away. How easy he makes it look. Pacy short ball on the hips, he just whipped that wi{{BATSMAN}} of short fine, and {{BOWLER}} is bowling in the high 140s. Only a genius can do things that {{BATSMAN}} does\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice looking shot! Short ball, {{BATSMAN}} has ample time to move across and pull it behind square on the leg-side. Well wide of the fine leg fielder. One bounce over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, for the umpteenth time today {{BOWLER}} has landed it on a shortish length, sat up nicely for {{BATSMAN}}, who cut it away fiercely square of the wicket. Timed it superbly as it beat the sweeper cover comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, CSK take a review against {{BATSMAN}}! Imran {{BOWLER}} looked excited but the impact looks just outside off, or probably umpire's call. Nope, wait. The impact was in line but the ball was bouncing over the stumps by some distance. {{BATSMAN}} was trying to play a drive but got beaten for spin. The ball clips his pads and races away to the fence thereafter. The onfield call stays\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ball has flown off the bat. Wow! What timing! {{BOWLER}} did the mistake of bowling on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} generally punishes when someone makes such mistake. He gets in a good position and whips it wide of mid-wicket for another four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, if it is power from one end, it is all grace from the other. The batsman leans into the drive and threads the ball away like a seasoned tailor. The man at mid-off had no chance even with the dive to his left. Superb bit of batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a beastly slog. Opens and picks out the top-spinner half way down the track with a swivel to dispatch it just past the reach of a diving Rahane at mid-wicket. Takes his finger tips along as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, time to roll! Full toss around off and it has been creamed past the diving man at extra cover, no stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back to the usual. Is this a surprise anymore. This time the skipper decides to test him with a short one, one that neither has the pace nor the bounce. And obliged with a swat. As flat as you'd want\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's bread and butter for Watto. Back of a length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} camps back, transfers his weight on the back foot and crunches this through the gap at covers, no fielder moved there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ah, time for French cricket from {{BATSMAN}}. Late swing for {{BOWLER}} again, {{BATSMAN}} squirts an inside edge that almost shaved the leg-stump. Fine leg was inside the circle and it escapes away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this won't please Ashwin one bit. Having called mid-off inside the ring, {{BOWLER}} bowls a low full toss and is tonked straight back over that fielder. Another chat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor bowling from {{BOWLER}}. Very rarely does that happen. But he has had two off days back to back. Went for 55 against KXIP and today ends with 1/49. Short and down leg, all {{BATSMAN}} had to do was help it past the fielder at short fine, he does so with utter ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time {{BOWLER}} can do nothing about it. Full in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} drills it straight down the ground and beats long-on to the right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and past the lone slip. Goodish length, moving away outside off. {{BATSMAN}} threw his bat hard at it, ends up feathering a thick outside edge which flew past Uthappa at widish first slip. The third man had no chance as it sped away to the fence in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one ball per over he will bowl short. Or else he can't bowl. That's {{BOWLER}} for you. This short ball doesn't rise enough to trouble {{BATSMAN}} who rolls his wrists on the swivel-pull and beats deep square to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy pickings for the batsman. On the pads and can't get any easier for {{BATSMAN}} who glances it past short fine. Needs one boundary more to reach his fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} opens his account with a boundary. That was no where close to the middle of his bat though, it came off the cue end. A length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard at the first ball he faces and as a courtesy of the power on that shot gets a four through square third man, that was in the air for a while but well over the fielder inside the circle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball at the stumps, real stinker to start his spell. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and smashes the pull through midwicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fuller ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg for a big hoick, gets a fat outside edge that goes fine of short third man and runs away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the horrors of a wi{{BATSMAN}} full toss. High. Lots of width. AB doesn't overhit, piling on and just slicing it behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, similar delivery to the previous one and this time {{BOWLER}} pays the price, {{BATSMAN}} is looking good today. The shots have been timed well. This time he's executed the cover-drive to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, poor from {{BOWLER}}. First, he oversteps and the yorker is way outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stays low and drives it square on the off-side. No chance for the sweeper this time around\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR. The Gabbar is so good with the pull shot. Picks the length early and slots it all along the carpet through mid-wicket, too much to do for deep square, he couldn't get there in time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's bowled 17 dot balls so it's okay if he concedes a boundary or two. Has been an excellent spell by {{BOWLER}} this. Short of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} jumps in his crease and cuts it away to the third man fence, beat the man in the deep quite comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, gets on top of the bounce, uses {{BOWLER}}'s pace and steers it to the right of backward point. No chance for the fielder running across to his left from third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries, short of a length and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans across and cuts it in front of square on the off-side, past AB at cover and runs away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, again, not off the middle, but he's managed enough chunk on this inside-halved-pull between mid-wicket and mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} offers width and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't let it go scot-free. Flails his hands and creams it with super timing past a diving Manish Pandey at cover-point. First boundary of the innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superb placement! Another off-pace ball from a back of a length at 109.9kph, {{BATSMAN}} spotted that and delayed his shot from the crease. Dabbed away through the gap between short third man and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it takes some talent to hit that high full-toss for a boundary. And {{BATSMAN}} indeed has that. Not the most elegantly but it surely was effective. It was a full-toss on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} stays in the crease and pumps it wide of long-off for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's done well to make the contact he's made. Floated up very wide, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and belts the flat-batted drive wide of long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundary to end the over. Just the over Sunrisers were looking for. {{BOWLER}} drops it short again and has to pay the price for it as {{BATSMAN}} rocks back in order to pull it over mid-wicket, yet again...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} flat-bat thrashes that, didn't hit it really sweetly, but enough to beat long-off running to his left. Looks to be finding his touch. Had to after my earlier comments about him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's been absolutely spanked through extra-cover. The ball has left a vapour trail. Short and wide from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} smokes it while backing away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more sloppiness. This time Yusuf lets one through the legs. {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track and flicks it to mid-wicket, straightforward stop and Yusuf makes a mess of it. Right through him and {{BATSMAN}} is underway\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} powers this down the ground, no long-off so it runs off to the boundary. {{BOWLER}} overpitched this one and got punished\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, awful delivery. Short of length ball down leg, {{BATSMAN}} helps it away past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done, low full-toss from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and chips it over mid-wicket for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he connects and that should be a relief. Floated up outside off and that was in the slot for {{BATSMAN}}, who free his arms and smashes it straight back over his partner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot! Losing Short might not be the worst thing happening for Rajasthan. Brings {{BATSMAN}} in early and he likes the new ball coming on. Pitched up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and creams the drive through the packed off-side field. Off the mark in style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and the boundaries continue to flow. Follows it up with a sweet sweep. Loopy delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes down and sweeps it firmly towards the long leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} wants to finish this off early. Bravely races down the pitch and forces {{BOWLER}} to shorten the length, it was well outside off stump, but {{BATSMAN}} reached out and cut it away past cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mid-off a touch squarer and this full length delivery finds a way. Driven with a straight bat. Always on with the ball nicely pitched up in your half\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, AB {{BATSMAN}} is un{{BATSMAN}}rway! Seam-up ball, the length is on the shorter si{{BATSMAN}} and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to pounce on it. Jumps on the back foot and punches it wi{{BATSMAN}} of mid-off beating the fiel{{BATSMAN}}r to his left. Excellent placement\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} errs in line and length, {{BATSMAN}} makes him pay the penalty. Short, quick and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waited and flayed it through cover. Threads the gap and it races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a wasted {{BATSMAN}}livery. Not quite the line to bowl to the best bat in these situations. Straying down leg hoping to swing it away and clips it behind square. Not quite the i{{BATSMAN}}al one with a 7-2 field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, handy boundary for {{BATSMAN}}, comes down the track, gets close to the ball and drills it back over his partner's head, a couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, rolls his wrists and helps it on its way, the man in the deep is square and the ball beats him to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery and {{BATSMAN}} does not miss out. Drifts this leggie too far down leg and it is easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}, he kneels down and sweeps it fine to the left of short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not again! Another short delivery in {{BATSMAN}}'s arc, he transfers his weight onto the back foot and smashes the hell out of that leather over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, completely unsettling the left-armer here. Backing away, making him change the lines. {{BOWLER}} doesn't follow him this time, so instead, he gets cut through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slices the cut away through backward point. The ball spun away from sweeper cover who dived too early and fell at least 3 feet short of getting to it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overcompensates with width this time. Now, now. Faf slices, over and wide of short third man with nobody behind\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, neatly done. The dipping slower delivery, {{BATSMAN}} moves around in the crease, gets inside the line and crouches a bit to scoop it over short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, back of a length and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} rides with the bounce and punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats cover and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's just a check shot and {{BATSMAN}} timed that to perfection. Waits for the pitched up delivery to arrive and crunches it with a straight bat face, no heavy backlift but it still flies over the man at mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good batting but poor bowling. {{BATSMAN}} expected the fast short ball outside off, waited on it and carved it behind square on the off-side - right between backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, only slightly short, not a lot, but {{BATSMAN}} has gone so far back in the crease, using the depth of it superbly. He's manufactured this pull shot through midwicket, and then succeeds in beating deep midwicket too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, doesn't get away this time. Seam up delivery from a shortish length, {{BATSMAN}} punches it handsomely through the covers. Finds the gap and the ball races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short. And pays the price. Some pressure off his shoulders with a rock back deep inside the crease and a pull into the cow corner fence. Piercing the gap to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that movement across the stumps was playing on the bowler's mind, he tried to bowl full and wide outside off stump again, {{BATSMAN}} stays put, lofts handsomely to the right of mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, these two compliment eachother so well. If, Gayle bludgeons the ball, {{BATSMAN}} just caresses it. It was a slower one from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} picks it up easily, gets in a might fine position and punches it like a boss. It beats cover and races to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's a summer sale. {{BATSMAN}} is making a joke of these boundaries. {{BOWLER}} misses his yorker, serves it up on a fuller length, {{BATSMAN}} brings his bottom hand into effect, dumps it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drifting in on off and middle, {{BATSMAN}} bends across and deflects it fine with a paddle-sweep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is welcomed with a boundary to the attack. The googly lands outside leg and {{BATSMAN}} swings it away over square leg, just bounces inside the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball at 119kph, sits up for {{BATSMAN}} from the middle of the pitch as he heaves through midwicket. {{BOWLER}}'s not been great here at the start\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, breaks the shackles. Gets a short one on the ribs and an angry swivelling pull comes out in spanking it into the square leg fence. Hides his pain under some runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, expensive over from {{BOWLER}}, topo short and at his pace it's easy pickings for the batsman. Karun waits on it and pulls it in front of square on the on-side. Long-on has no chance of cutting it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no slip in place and this outside edge has run away for four. Grip and turn with the carrom ball for {{BOWLER}}, enough to find {{BATSMAN}}'s outside edge and also enough to keep rolling into the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not the kind of fielding effort you need. {{BATSMAN}} got on his knee and helped this flatter ball with a half-sweep. The man from deep backward square leg ran to his right, got to it but fumbled when it mattered the most\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good yorker from {{BOWLER}}, but he has to watch in agony as {{BATSMAN}}'s toe-edge runs away past short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this match ain't over folks. To rub salt into the wounds and other jazz. {{BOWLER}} goes wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} protracts his hands and lifts it over cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and look at this cover drive, he's moved onto 20 and all have been boundaries. Fullish delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and creams the ball along the ground, raced away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not a boundary ball but that's T20. Back of length around off, {{BATSMAN}} crouches a bit and swats it away wide of mid-on, not off the middle but he had enough wood on that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, safe shot by {{BATSMAN}} as he eyes the vacant deep mid-wicket boundary. A short ball around off, the southpaw stands tall and slogs it over mid-wicket. One bounce and over the fence for as {{BATSMAN}} gets his first boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that has been hit so hard. Rohit at mid-off dove to his right at mid-off, got a hand on that and took the sting out of the shot, but it still raced away to the fence. When {{BATSMAN}} saw the pitched up delivery he just plonked his front foot and drilled it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slow, short, sitting up outside off. {{BATSMAN}} finally finds a gap, rocking behind and slaps it backward of point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is teeing off like a golfer. Uses his feet again, stays a bit leg sidish this time. Fetches the heave from off and directs it through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off-pace delivery and {{BATSMAN}} spotted it early. The length was short and with his open stance, it was always going to be trouble for {{BOWLER}}, punched off the back foot in front of square and Axar at sweeper gave up the chase very soon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that came right off the meat. On a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stays put and punches this sweetly through the gap at covers, sweeper kept it place right after that shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball alright, but serves too much of width. Ends up as a full toss, {{BATSMAN}} chips it over extra cover, easy peasy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, had to make a big effort to get to this wide slower ball, and then manufactures remarkable power to cover it over extra-cover. Highly valuable fifty from {{BATSMAN}}. It's given the Sunrisers a score\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, some fortune for {{BATSMAN}}. Walked across and tried to slog it across the line. Gets a thick top-edge and it flies away to the third man fence. The fielder was inside the ring and had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slaps over mid-off. Well, well. It might be a very miniscule drop in the ocean remaining for Kolkata, but a smoke nevertheless. Backs away, and absolutely thumps this shorter delivery over mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, miscued pull and the lightning quick outfield ensures that it is a boundary. Got to feel for the bowler. Bowled two good balls and both have gone for fours. Banged it short and got good lift, cramped {{BATSMAN}} for room. {{BATSMAN}}, despite not being in a good position, went for the pull. Got decent wood and more importantly it went in the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, to the left of Uthappa now. No chance for him this time, another sweep, dragged from middle but gets it wi{{BATSMAN}} of short fine and it just raced away. {{BATSMAN}} gets going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, reverse swept! Flighted one around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knee and reverse sweeps it past the man at backward point to score a boundary, did well to connect his shot and past the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top shot! Full delivery at 146kph, but {{BATSMAN}} had made some room to open up the off-side field, lofts it without much footwork over extra cover and pocketed a much needed boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball again but slower at 120ks. This time punished. He waited on it and muscled the ball over mid-wicket for a four. He was not over committed into the stroke and that helped him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dances down the track again. {{BOWLER}} smartly bowls it wide but does not get away. {{BATSMAN}} manages to reach on the drive and cracks it to the deep cover fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, a second slip would have swallowed it, back of a length and in that channel outside off, {{BATSMAN}} pushed at that tamely, got a thick edge that flew past the lone slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, dropped short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and clatters the cut behind square on the off-side, no one moved\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fuller length delivery outside off, whipped away, dragging it from outside the off-stump with a Laxman-esque flourish for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, yet another slower one, errs in length this time, half-cook, and {{BATSMAN}} transfers his bodyweight into an elegant extra cover drive for four. Balances himself and poses for the cameras after the shot. Yep, that was right out the meat!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft touch from {{BATSMAN}}! Too straight in line from {{BOWLER}} and it's clipped softly wide of short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fetch that! On a full length outside off, shaping away to an extent and {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink at it. Smacks it over extra cover as he's off the mark with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 143.8kph. And {{BATSMAN}}'s being given a real workout here -- this time undoing him on a flick across the line, only for the genuine leading edge flying away through an empty slip cordon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ravishing cover drive from {{BATSMAN}}. This looks a belter of a pitch. This is no half-volley, but the ball is coming on so beautifully that {{BATSMAN}} just leans across and caresses it on the up. Awesome timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, whoa. Take that for timing. All of it employed here on duty tonight. Leans onto the front leg and shows the full bat face in spanking a lofted drive over the bowler's head. Holds the pose to make it all the more elegant\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, for a second, {{BOWLER}} thought that he had flummoxed the batsman with his googly but {{BATSMAN}} made incredible adjustment despite not reaching the pitch. Throws his hand fully and blasts it past the non-striker. Nobody is stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, make that three! Poor stuff from {{BOWLER}}. He shortens his length and strays it on leg, wristily tucked away through backward square leg. 14 runs off the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mid-off in the circle and {{BATSMAN}} goes over his head. Scrambled seam lengh delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and gives charge to lift it over mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, time to buy a lottery ticket, {{BATSMAN}}! He has been saved three or four times in this knock so far. It was a slower one wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} attempts a slog, it comes off the outside half of the bat and just about clears short third. Jadhav gives a chase but ball will win\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 137.1kph, full and outside off - you can't be bowling there to this guy. He plays one of his favourite shots. Throws his blade with an opened bat-face and sends it over backward point. 11 off the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark with a boundary. Floated on leg, {{BATSMAN}} sinks low and sweeps, gets it much finer and collects a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flat leg-break just around off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} crouches low and cuts that when it was inches from the stumps past backward point for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, absolute overcook outside off. Sharma leans, drives, and creams it through the covers to help himself past 5000 IPL runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, jumps down the pitch and squirts an inside edge on the cross batted swat, no-one in the deep at mid-wicket and he'll claim another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, outside edge and beats short third man. Floated up, spins away after pitching and lures {{BATSMAN}} into a drive, who goes with hard hands and gets an thick outside edge. Zooms away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is class batting, knows third man is inside the ring, as soon as {{BOWLER}} dropped the slower ball short, {{BATSMAN}} was there to just guide in the gap wide of backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, makes room once again and swings wildly, the drift picks the thick inside edge and runs fine of the keeper to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mind-reader {{BATSMAN}}. Expected the slower delivery from {{BOWLER}}, so walks across his stumps and gets into a great position to smack the pull over square leg. Picked his spot and executed it to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide, Patel slashes and slashes hard. The edge flies away through to the third man boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done by {{BATSMAN}}, his first runs of #IPL2019 - a friendly back of a length delivery on his hips, he gets inside the line and clips it behind square on the on-side, past the diving short fine and races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, welcome into the attack, Mr {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knee and sweeps the floated delivery with all his might. So much power in that shot, four more for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a full toss on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} whips it past the man at fine leg who had no chance to stop this. He was a touch too fine in order to cut this down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and slipping down leg, {{BATSMAN}} helps it to the fine leg boundary boards with a perfect swivel pull\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, typical overcompensate. After a drifter into the pads, Krishna goes into a bouncer, wide outside off. {{BATSMAN}} has his timing tonight, and enough on it to jump-cut it square. The powerplay's enough to do its bit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is the battle to watch out for. Off-break drifts on the legs and {{BATSMAN}} picks it away effortlessly in front of square on the leg-side, just bounced inside the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and {{BATSMAN}} and his cover drives. {{BOWLER}} floates it full, gives out width as well. Sliced, powerfully, and over extra cover's leap from within the circle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that length is not going to trouble {{BATSMAN}} or for that matter any batsman. Short and on off, {{BATSMAN}} makes a bit of room and cracks it in front of square, raced away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, an edge and that has fetched him a boundary. Was a slower delivery outside off and {{BATSMAN}} got an outside edge on his drive. The fielder at third man tried his best to stop it with a dive, but he couldn't really do it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a loosener from {{BOWLER}}. He's not finished it well as {{BATSMAN}} tucks in a four. Angled it down leg, fine was inside the ring and {{BATSMAN}} glances it past the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, successive boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}. This was full on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets down and goes for a sweep, gets a glove to it and manages to evade short fine leg this time around\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft touch from the skipper. Quicker delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} allows the ball to come, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and sends it to the left of short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that has been smashed. Wow! What power. It was on a fuller length and was in the arc of {{BATSMAN}}, he clears his front leg and pumps it straight down the ground for a boundary. No stopping that!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's winning it for his team. Makes some room and nearly slices this overpitched delivery from off-stump. The placement is spot on, so is the timing as he nails this past backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full, wide, sliced and a four. The ball raced between short third and point for a four. Reached the ball with his tentacles and managed to thread the ball into the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, make it four in a row. Exhibition of stroke play by {{BATSMAN}}. Short ball well outside off and the batsman plays an exquisite square cut. No chance of stopping that, neither for the fielder at point, nor for the fielder at third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} Koushik isn't learning. Keeps landing it short and gets smacked. {{BATSMAN}} rocks onto his back foot and all he needed to do was get it over the fielder, did it with sheer ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward, uses his wrists to good effect and flicks it over mid-on, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played, {{BOWLER}} drifts this one on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he gets inside the line and helps it fine, beats Mishra at short fine and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it took 39 balls for {{TEAM}} to get a boundary. And now they've got two in three. Slower ball banged into the pitch outside off, this time {{BATSMAN}} gets stuck into it and slashes it into the extra-cover boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fuller ball on the legs of {{BATSMAN}}, who gets the toe-edge while trying to flick. The ball races to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful shot! See the ball, hit the ball, is the mantra. A round-armish delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} who has taken leg-stump guard, has enough room to free his arms. Strokes it over and wide of mid-off to collect his third boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, does not miss out on the timing despite backing away. Too full and the batsman screamed the drive away through the cover region for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50*35. {{BOWLER}} drags the length back, which means {{BATSMAN}} decides to wait. And wait. And wait some more, before fetching a real late cut out of DK's gloves to guide it real fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much needed boundary for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} has been mistiming those pulls/heaves but not this time. He waits for the delivery to arrive and pummels it to wide long-on, couple of bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and pulled over mid-wicket. Judged the length so quickly, left deep square chasing shadows. Top shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the blockhole, the ball chirps the toe-end of the bat and bisects the gap between the keeper and the slip fielder to race away to the fence. That was really full and was just outside off to force the batsman to jam his bat down on that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played, tad too full and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} stays deep in the crease and then gets enough power on the lofted on-drive, clears mid-on with ease and bounces away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, three in a row for {{BATSMAN}}, comes down the track to a well flighted delivery and lifts it over Gayle at short extra-cover. This is a smashing start from {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not where he wanted to hit this but who cares? {{TEAM}} are cantering now. Slower and shortish, foxed {{BATSMAN}} for a moment but the length allowed him to adjust. Lobbed wide of backward point and it races away. Just 11 off 10 needed now!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball, asking to be hit and {{BATSMAN}} obliges. Not exactly a half-volley but plenty of width and it's sliced away over cover-point. Intentionally done by {{BATSMAN}} and picks up a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a gift and {{BATSMAN}} will not miss out. {{BOWLER}} lost his line as he attempted another slower ball, ends up drifting down the leg-side and all {{BATSMAN}} had to do was to whip it into the gap - he does so, behind square on the on-side and MI continue to bleed boundaries\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, turns out to be a really poor over from {{BOWLER}}, didn't bowl to the field. He bowls another one down the leg-side and you can't do that with fine leg inside the line. {{BATSMAN}} calmly waits and flicks the ball through square leg. Great start for {{TEAM}}, 14 off the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's the {{BATSMAN}} we know. He backs away, creates room and thumps this over mid-off for a boundary. No stopping that!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, even the mishits are going to the fence, thanks to some sloppy work by Morgan. Short and turning away, {{BATSMAN}} pulls and the bottom hand comes off the handle, the ball goes to wide long-on, where Morgan allows it to escape\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of a good length ball on the middle and leg. {{BATSMAN}} pulls well behind square on the on-side. Races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drops it down short and is smoked back down the ground. Slapped to the fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, floated outside off and {{BATSMAN}} has chipped it over covers for four runs, runs are leaking as {{BATSMAN}} brothers are having some fun out in the middle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much needed boundary for {{TEAM}}! {{BATSMAN}} latches on to the short ball and swivel-pulls it into the gap at deep mid-wicket. The ball drops just in front of the boundary cushions, such sweet was the timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is a good shot. {{BOWLER}} is disappointed but there was not much he could do. Drifting in from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} fetches the reverse sweep from leg-stump and places it past the backward point fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not a good start. Back of a length angled across the left hander, {{BATSMAN}} flat-bats without any timing straight past {{BOWLER}}, with mid-on and mid-off inside the ring the ball races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark with a boundary. Streaky but he'll take it. Length {{BATSMAN}}livery that gained some extra bounce, ABD flashes his bat and ends up getting a thick outsi{{BATSMAN}} edge that beats short third man. {{BOWLER}} can't believe his luck, got to feel for him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's the form he is in. Picks the length early on the shortish delivery. He's quick to transfer his weight on to the back foot and pull it to perfection through mid-wicket. Made sweet sound of the willow as the ball met it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hammered! Things going worse for {{BOWLER}} who has now conceded 48 runs. Another floated delivery outside off and {{BATSMAN}} slams it through the gap at covers. {{BATSMAN}}'s looking unstoppable\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 'hit me' ball from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} pummels it through the off-side. Slower, shorter and wider as well, gift for any batsman and it gets the treatment. Slapped through point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how did that go for a boundary. {{BOWLER}} saw the batsman back away and fired a yorker, {{BATSMAN}} brings his bat down a touch late and manages to get a toe-end on it. Luckily for the batter, misses the stumps and runs away to third man for another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by DK, this was flighted well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went down low, rolled his wrists over and slog sweeps it past mid-wicket, beats the fielder getting across from deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's back-to-back boundaries now. {{BATSMAN}} has changed gears and he got the momentum he wanted. It's another short ball from {{BOWLER}}, not the kind of short ball that rises to head, {{BATSMAN}} stays back and flat-bats it over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Anil Kumar Chaudhary has a wry smile on his face. Because {{BOWLER}} was appealing for an lbw. The umpire spotted the tickle. A slower ball yorker from {{BOWLER}} that dips on the batsman, {{BOWLER}}'s trademark weapon. But {{BATSMAN}} picked that and got it wide of short fine inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how good are those wrists? Must have learnt a bit from VVS. Wasn't a bad ball at all from {{BOWLER}}. On a good length and on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} stayed in his crease and flicked it nonchalantly over and wide of mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, excellent from {{BATSMAN}}. Goes inside-out over extra cover. Saw the flighted delivery early, bent low and lifted it effortlessly over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, so he gets a pitched up delivery from {{BOWLER}} and drives a boundary away. Why not. Room outside off, half a stride to middle it and off she goes through covers!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sloppy effort from Rayudu at long-off. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get it anywhere near the middle of the bat but he puts power in the shot as he generally does and ball goes for a four. {{BATSMAN}} brings up his fifty with that four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh my, this is extraordinary. The expression on Rohit's face, rather the blankness of it tells the story. Wide leg-cutter from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} switches his stance and reverse-scoops it over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off and running. Gets into business straightaway after having a sighter. Backs away to create some room, {{BOWLER}} kept it on middle and subsidized with width. {{BATSMAN}} brings his bottom hand into play. Just extends his arms and steers it past the crowded off-side field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 13 they will need off the last over, DD. Another short ball and {{BATSMAN}} slices the pull over the keeper's head. A couple of bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's toying around. May his leg never recover. Makes {{BOWLER}} bowl straight, threatening a move around. But sways inside the line, flat-batted and hammers it round the corner. Pile on the powerplay\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, walks across his sticks and tickles the ball away fine. Perfect ball but {{BATSMAN}} managed to get enough bat on it to peel the ball away fine. {{BOWLER}} almost went up in an appeal before realizing that it was off the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed down the ground! {{BATSMAN}} into his 40s as he makes sure to make the bowler pay for pitching this one up. Played it straight as an arrow as the fielder at long-on couldn't get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full ball in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} feasts on it. Thumps the drive through extra cover with lovely balance, stand and admire stuff!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, room on offer and {{BATSMAN}} accepts gleefully! Frees his arms and flashes it past cover-point. Absolutely creamed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot! That is not the place to bowl to any batsman. Short, wide and outside off, just the delivery {{BATSMAN}} would have liked to get him going, slapped the cut square on the off-side and opened his account in style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} Koushik's night keeps getting worse. Fires it short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} gets a feather of an edge on the attempted cut, the edge runs past DK's gloves\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, moves away from the line of the short of length off-cutter, creates some room and flays it away over extra-cover. {{BATSMAN}} keeping Mumbai afloat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swings south does {{BATSMAN}}. But the ball goes in the direction of north. He won't mind though as long as boundaries are coming. Shortish outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard and gets a thickish outside edge that flies away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clubbed wide of long-on. It was in the air but {{BATSMAN}} got his placement right. On a good length from a flat trajectory, he gets under it and flays it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too close to cut! {{BATSMAN}} pulls it off though and gets it away very fine, beating short third man to the fence. 1000 IPL runs up for QDK!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, questions are bound to be raised over {{BATSMAN}}'s batting position. To my mind at least, he's been in stunning form of late. Such brilliant timing as he whips a full ball from outside off through mid-wicket. {{TEAM}} needed that finish to what had been a quiet over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Second for him this season. Gets there with a cheeky little scoop. Expects {{BOWLER}} to target the stumps, shuffles across and gets low, then laps it over Karthik to bring up the milestone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely - {{BATSMAN}} is making most of this opportunity to bat time - had a part in the run-out of KW, but that hasn't figured in his plan since - tad too short and he's very quick on the pull, swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it over square leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for the combo! He waited on that slower delivery and then dismissed it out of his sight with disdain. Got the room as well to free his arms and then got the ball speeding between cover and mid-off for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky from the skipper as he opens the face of the blade and runs it past the diving keeper for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, consecutive fours to finish the over. {{TEAM}} desperately need some momentum here. I think {{BOWLER}} is getting a bit carried away. Bowls it full on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} whips him over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, McClenaghan has let this sneak right through him. Poor from the fast bowler. {{BOWLER}} turns around in disgust. Good length ball slanted outside off, squirted off a thick edge and should have only been a single down to third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a {{BATSMAN}} special. The short-arm pull.. the way he just picks length quickly and whips it so effortlessly with superb timing. Flies away over square leg. Don't think {{BOWLER}} did too much wrong here. Just slightly short maybe, but we're talking inches here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how far has that gone. Far enough but bounces just inside the ropes. {{BATSMAN}} took on the short ball and went for the hook, hitting it high and almost handsome. One bounce over the ropes at deep backwars square leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, makes room to open up the off-side, slashes hard and gets lucky with a thick top-edge that flies over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, width on offer from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and slaps it square on the off-side. Tripathi got across to his left from deep point, puts in the slide and drags the ball back in - but the ball slowly rolls back onto the ropes\n",
            "Na{{BATSMAN}}em to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, my word, how's this gone for four! Crazy. Unbelievable power with the bottom hand. He seemed to be cramped on the back foot but is somehow able to whip it between long-on and {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bowls a low full toss on the pads from round the wicket. A hit-me delivery. Flicked away very fine. Watson doesn't bother to put a dive. Why would you do that, when you already know the result\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss outside off and though {{BATSMAN}} didn't get it off the middle, he gets it into the gap - sliced over extra cover and Gopal cannot chase it down. He immediately asks for a drier pair of gloves..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a gross delivery! Short of a good length delivery with no pace behind it. {{BATSMAN}} moves across and helps it away well wide of short fine. Runs away into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, really poor from {{BOWLER}}, who switched to round the wicket and delivered a low full toss on the pads with fine leg inside the ring. The second time he's done that tonight. Easy put away for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that should get him going. First boundary for {{BATSMAN}} this edition. Short and wide delivery, {{BATSMAN}} hangs back and relies on placing the ball, cuts it between backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky runs but {{TEAM}} won't mind it at this stage of the innings. Full toss and should have actually been dispatched for a six but {{BATSMAN}} doesn't middle it well enough. Gets a fat insi{{BATSMAN}} edge that's well wi{{BATSMAN}} of short fine leg and speeds away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stand and deliver! {{BOWLER}} doles out a full toss, {{BATSMAN}} stays put in his crease and lifts it over the bowler's head. No big back-lift, but still manages to generate the botttom hand power. The batter poses for the photographs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more, third boundary in this over. Deft touch from the {{TEAM}} skipper. Waits for the ball to arrive to him and cheekily opens the bat face at the last instance to guide it well wide of the short third man fielder. The ball dribbles away into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, check and four! The slower delivery and the batsman just checked his punch to ensure he lent enough power on the shot. The ball raced away to the fence teasing Gowtham, the man at mid-off, till the very end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wrong 'un is dragged down and {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for it in the crease, cleared his front leg and pulled it in front of square, bisecting the two fielders in the deep comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and gone! Gone for a four. Dhoni does not go for it to his left. Should be classified as a chance even if it might have been touch and go. The slip was wide and the ball goes between the keeper and the slip for a four. That is a huge reprieve for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries and it has turned out to be another expensive over from {{BOWLER}}. He got too predictable with the slower ones, {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for it, cuts it hard and beats the fielder at point to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, handy runs. {{BATSMAN}} it is this time. Premeditated the paddle scoop and got the length too, a full toss. Watched it onto the bat closely to guide it away fine down the leg-side to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there is swing alright, but it's an absolute loosener. Sitting up from a back of a length outside off, gets whacked through covers. {{BATSMAN}} is underway in IPL 2020. Stood there in the crease and nonchalantly drove it on the back foot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, genuine edge. Zips up off the turf to take the splice on {{BATSMAN}}'s lost overused dab. But the pace is enough to run it into third man. Or is it? Gowtham chases, dives, but nope, can't get his hand off the ball while his leg touches the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just the ideal sitting up length. Bangs it in but the pitch just doesn't allow the ball to do anything cheeky. Right in the slot and swatted away flat batted through backward square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brings up the 50 of the stand. A real fightback this. And gets there in some style as well with a lovely looking square cut. Guess what, there is no one out there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, audacious from {{BATSMAN}}, but then that's what he is about. Slower length ball, he gets into position early and slaps the reverse-hit through backward point. Much needed boundary off the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed! In the slot outside off and {{BATSMAN}} has thumped it right over the bowler's head, can't keep a fielder there, can you?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dispatched with disdain! Short in length around off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and hacks across the line. Times this one to perfection and sends it to the deep mid-wicket fence. Proper knock-out punch this is proving to be. Things are only going to get worse from here on, especially with the dew setting in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! This has been a sensational knock from the lad from Punjab! He raises his bat in delight! He waits for this delivery to arrive and places it wide of backward point. Again, placement was best aspect of the shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smacked! Short ball by AJ and it has been slammed towards deep mid-wicket by {{BATSMAN}}. Fifty up for {{BOWLER}}..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just short of the yorker mark, and {{BATSMAN}} takes toll by hammering it down the ground for four. Really good showing from him, even though in a losing cause\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes for the slower short ball again, but gets it down leg. With fine leg up, {{BATSMAN}} only has to help his pull past the fielder in the circle, which he comfortably does after swivelling into the shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, leg byes given but looked like there was some bat. Hung over from the last boundary, {{BOWLER}} tries to cramp {{BATSMAN}} for room and overdoes it with a gimme down leg. Glanced away for four runs. Who cares if it's off the bat or not..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Just a mere push and the ball races away. Full and angled across off, {{BATSMAN}} eases with a forward extension past the bowler and the timing takes care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, reverse slap. {{BATSMAN}} is not hanging back. Makes his intentions clear, sees the ball outside off and times the pants of it, got it in the gap too. Just behind backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is absolutely belting it today! Sees the slower full ball dip outside off and times the slap-drive to perfection, raced away to the deep cover fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, juicy full-toss and {{BATSMAN}} has put it away, turning out to be an expensive start from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} leans into the shot and finds the gap wide of mid-off, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, big over for {{TEAM}}. 20 off it and {{BOWLER}} has been put under pressure. Fuller and width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} square drives and the placement is superb, well wide of the man sweeping on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunched away! Too full from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} lays into the drive, smashes it towards wide long-off where Karun put in a desperate slide. Got a hand on it but couldn't stop it cleanly. First boundary for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, saw the field and preempted the scoopy flick over short fine, got good connection and posted it in the gap. Deep backward square can't get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} continues to make merry, back of a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} prods across and pulls it back over the bowler's head, a few bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tossed up outside off, pitched up, {{BATSMAN}} comes forward and whips it between mid-wicket and long-on expertly for four. Elegance personified\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} brings out the sweep. Safe bet against the spin. Went low, rolled his wrists and placed it in the gap in front of square on the leg-side. Hooda from the deep ran across and dived near the ropes, but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more! {{BATSMAN}} isn't afraid to play his strokes. Sees the width outside off and throws the kitchen sink. Gets it well wide of backward point. No chance for third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is having fun! Slower and fuller, he just shuffles a bit and slog sweeps merrily over backward square leg. Clean strike and it races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, a third slip would have gobbled it up. Short of a good length and angling across {{BATSMAN}}, opened him up as he looked to defend, the edge flew past the diving Maxwell at second slip, third man can't get across - despite the dive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant placement from {{BATSMAN}}. Safe bet against {{BOWLER}}. Tossed up on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} sank low and gets under it to sweep it in the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tell you what this is a batsman's paradise! Just a hint of room for {{BATSMAN}}, it was a slower one too. {{BATSMAN}} waits for it to arrive, adjusts his bat-swing brilliantly and guides it wide of backward point. This outfield = National highway and third man had no realistic chance of stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now to the other side of the ground. Bit more air and {{BATSMAN}} fetches the sweep from outside off, he rolled his wrists to place it in front square on the leg-side - right between deep mid-wicket and long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's all too easy for {{BATSMAN}}, wrong line from {{BOWLER}}, drifted this one down the leg-side, the fielder at fine leg was inside the ring and all {{BATSMAN}} had to do was to find the gap past him, he does so with the sweep and raises {{TEAM}}'s 50\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, a juicy full-toss from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track and clears mid-wicket with the lofted on-drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played, {{BATSMAN}} was so quick in reading {{BOWLER}}'s slower ball, prods across and clips it in front of square on the on-side - beats mid-wicket and runs away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now {{BATSMAN}} was almost hoodwinked in the air. {{BOWLER}} saw him charging down and bowled it slow down leg. But {{BATSMAN}} was upto it. Would have been stumped otherwise. Gets some bat and deflects it wide of the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edgy but looked like it was intentional from {{BATSMAN}}. The slower ball from Rahman, ends up as a wide yorker. {{BATSMAN}} digs with an open bat face, runs it more off the outer half and it beats short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, length ball and {{BATSMAN}} was waiting on it, gets a good stride forward and thumps it over mid-off, couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now a four. Another fast-paced delivery, {{BATSMAN}} swings hard and makes good contact. Goes into the cow corner fence\n",
            "San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superb shot. The crowd go wild. So cleanly struck too. On a length and around off, lifted over extra-cover. A proper cricketing shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, bowls the slower short ball on the stumps, Bhuvi misses on the ramp and a hint of deviation after pitching meant Samson couldn't control the pace despite the dive to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another boundary and {{BATSMAN}} is piling it on. {{BOWLER}} overcompensates and drops one short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats mid-off and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} silences the crowd with a glorious cover drive. Wow. Not even all that full, but he leans into it languidly and creams it through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} not having a great time here. Bowls this full and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stretches across and slices it for another boundary, this time wide of third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, these two are targeting {{BOWLER}} and this is the big push DD needed. Too short in length and {{BATSMAN}} won't miss out on these. Swivels back and nails the pull. Well to the right of deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is cricket. A chance off the last ball followed by a boundary. Flighted delivery on a fullish length, righth in the arc for {{BATSMAN}}, who heaves it to the deep mid-wicket fence. Placed it expertly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is looking in sublime touch. Just leans forward, presents full face of the bat and pings the push drive off the middle past the diving fielder at extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, horror ball to begin. Short, wide asking to be punished. {{BATSMAN}} stays leg-side of the ball as he goes deep in his crease. Then employs the cut shot behind square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sublime timing from {{BATSMAN}}, length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} leans across and clips it towards mid-wicket, it was in the air but well wide of the fielder, races away to the fence in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets to his maiden fifty. Gets a hug from de Villiers. Kohli punches the air in delight. They are happy for him and rightly so. What a time to come to the party. Low full-toss, sliced in the air but in the gap as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how slow is Uthappa? My word. Took an age to realise where the ball was going and then gave chase, but can only parry it onto the ropes. Wasn't so well-timed but Uthappa picked it up late from the bat and his sprinting ability left a lot to be {{BATSMAN}}sired\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, improvisation at its best. This was a full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and scoops this gift over short fine leg. On a bounce and into the fence she goes. Has quietly moved into the 30s\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slapped over extra cover! Just the kind of release shot {{BATSMAN}} was looking for. Wide half volley, he reaches out and chips it comfortably over the infield. No protection in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, kabooom! {{BATSMAN}} is off the blocks in a flash once more. Short of a length outside off, he just backs away a bit and hammers it on the up through the covers. Found the gap well and nobody really budged\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pitched up. Right in the slot to be spanked. And {{BATSMAN}} doesn't disappoint. Once again leans onto his front knee and just swings his bat through the line. A lot straighter this time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there he goes - the enforecer - clearing out his front leg, not quite getting hold of his rather agricultural hoick, but his biceps will do it, get it over the mid-wicket infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Miller's jump at long-off isn't good enough. This was barelled away by {{BATSMAN}}. Absolutely brutal. Gets a fullish delivery and he got under it, pumping it with a straight 45-degree bat for a hit in the V. Now who doesn't like it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, big edge. {{BATSMAN}} misreads the googly, wafts down the wrong line, but what are outside-edges for? The ball gropes at it, running through the slip cordon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, knuckle ball and {{BATSMAN}} smokes it over extra cover. He made room and generated enough power to take it over Williamson, the ball bounced just inside the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, yup, getting cheeky isn't a bad way of breaking the shackles. {{BOWLER}} gets a touch predictable with one good length too many, and {{BATSMAN}} shuffles quickly, realizes fine leg is inside the circle and scoops it away over him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just over extra-cover! 117kph, length ball wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} had to reach out for it but he throws everything and is able to smear it over the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and flies past slip. Steaky but {{BATSMAN}} won't mind. Loopy delivery, almost a yorker length outside off. {{BATSMAN}} squeezes it and gets a healthy outside edge which eludes slip and beats short third man as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 118.9kph. And then length and width. {{BATSMAN}} gets forward, and rocks back in a fierce cut. Nothing a diving point can do\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, help-yourself-to-a-boundary ball from {{BOWLER}}. Short and down leg, fine leg was inside the ring and {{BATSMAN}} swivel-pulls it behind square on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, miss the yorker, get set to face the penalty. {{BOWLER}} misses it by an inch, ends up as a low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} after clearing his front leg, whips it to the left of mid-on. Raced away in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, that's {{BATSMAN}}'s own version of MSD's helicopter shot. This was full and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was deep inside the crease as he whipped it wide of mid-wicket, no chance for the man running across from long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now here's a surprise. {{BOWLER}} bowling in the powerplay. He drops it short and wide first ball and is crashed to the boundary. DD building some good momentum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he checks the drive as the ball stops on him from a length, but the timing is splendid. It flies away over extra-cover for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and this time he has managed to beat that fielder, has MSD. Was a half-tracker by {{BOWLER}} and the {{TEAM}} skipper has timed his pull and placed it into the gap at deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, pace can be your ally sometimes and it can be your enemy too! {{BOWLER}} bowls it at 146ks but spills it down leg and {{BATSMAN}} manages to get some thingh pad as he misses the flick. Races away...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, plenty of width on offer and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it, stands tall in his crease and smacks the leather over extra cover. Take four!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, jumps down, a little too close for comfort eventually, but then has quick hard hands and good enough power in squeezing out this eventual yorker through sweeper. Yup, the powerplay does help ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, {{BOWLER}} is proving to be expensive - back of a length and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it and then cuts it late, beats the sliding effort of the fielder running across to his left from deep point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, gets down low to a well flighted delivery outside leg, rolls his wrists and sweeps it behind square on the on-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 19 runs off the over! {{BATSMAN}} is underway in a grand style. It was bowled on the stumps, but overpitched. {{BATSMAN}} blasts the straight drive. The ball bullets away into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, \"that's not how you follow it up,\" says Ian Bishop on air. After bowling a good bumper, {{BOWLER}} now bowls a fullish ball, {{BATSMAN}} stays in his crease and hit it through the line. Lofted over wide mid-off and there is no one to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor effort from Rayudu in the deep. And that will result in a four. Back-to-back fours for {{TEAM}} and {{BATSMAN}}. It was short and was on the body, {{BATSMAN}} gets behind it and pulls it with a lot of power to deep square leg. Rayudu there should have easily stopped it but instead he lets it go\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's middled this alright, doesn't bother running! The off-cutter, {{BATSMAN}} launches it over the bowler's head and beats long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fine shot to start for {{BATSMAN}}! Picked the googly and got across on one knee to sweep it hard. Connected well, got it wide of short fine leg and it raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, leg-side dross. {{BATSMAN}} won't spare. He clips it behind square, so far that the man at deep square couldn't reach\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} reaches fifty in style. Fastest individual fifty for {{TEAM}}. Walks across his sticks, goes low and scoops it to the fine leg fence. Raises his bat and Tiwary embraces him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, very full from {{BOWLER}}, right in the zone for {{BATSMAN}}, he gets his front-foot forward and drills it to the left of the umpire. The two fielders in the deep have no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} lashes that behind point. Gee, he's hit that with some power. Third man ain't getting there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, strong bottom hand on that. Flatter delivery around off and it's short too, {{BATSMAN}} drags it away with a firm pull and beats the man at deep mid-wicket this time around, this was a powerful blow by the pocket-sized dynamite\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done, short of a length and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and tucks it fine - backward square leg was inside the ring and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cut away fiercely past point and a big roar from the crowd! Who are they supporting? Quicker delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} goes back and cuts really hard\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot of the evening so far! A fuller length delivery that jagged back in a little, {{BATSMAN}} charged out of his crease, gave himself some room and presented a straight bat in lifting it over the bowler's head. Balance and timing in sync and then he poses for the cameras too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not sure he intended that to go there but he won't mind it. Full delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} aims to drive it through extra cover, but the bat face turns and the ball ends up in front of square on the leg-side - splitting deep mid-wicket and long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, not a great ball from {{BOWLER}}, floaty half-volley on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and whips it over square leg, the man in the deep has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, delicious shot! Oozing class! Not all that bad a ball, just a fab stroke. On a good length just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} just stood tall and cracked the back foot punch on the up. Through the covers and it blazed away. What a shot!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sublime, really sublime. Oh, he is making this look like an exhibition match. Short of a length, a touch wide and he stands tall to punch it beautifully through backward point. Timed it so sweetly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, errs in length a fraction and {{BATSMAN}} is onto it in a flash. Sees the ball dip right in his arc (fuller length) and thumps the drive square over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four. That is what pace does. Short and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} made room this time and threw this kitchen sink at it, the thickish outside edge runs away fine beating the fielder in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky! {{BOWLER}} goes short and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands up and elevates it above the 'keeper. He just used the pace on the ball and pocketed a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the entire repertoire of shots is out there! The exhibition mode is on. Tossed up delivery and was driven into the covers for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, aand it doesn't EVER mater where your fielders are when the ball is a very friendly full toss drifting down leg. {{BATSMAN}} tries to sweep, getting a tickle somewhere off something to run away really fine .. and we thought 160 was too many!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50-run stand comes up for the duo with a top shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Wasn't all that short, {{BATSMAN}} quickly jumps on the back foot and cuts it square of the wicket. The fielder in the deep was too square and had no chance of stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}} - he's taking the lead here, mid-off was inside the ring and {{BATSMAN}} chanced his arm - length ball outside off, he didn't time it all that well, sliced it high and cleared the fielder in the ring, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky shot by {{BATSMAN}}! Waits for the ball to arrive, opens the bat face very late and guides it to the third man fence. With that pace, it was always going to race away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed! Flighted delivery and the idea from {{BOWLER}} was to land it full enough to the blockhole, {{BATSMAN}} had made room and that allowed him to open up his arms and strike it inside out over extra cover, no chance for the sweeper to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cute little paddle now. The line is down leg and with short fine inside that's not the way to go, {{BATSMAN}} gets sufficient bat on that and beats the man inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air, in the gap and that's {{BATSMAN}}'s third boundary in this over. Once again, {{BOWLER}} bowls one on the shorter side and {{BATSMAN}} went back to heave. Didn't quite get it off the middle, but the placement was right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, belted past short extra cover. He nee{{BATSMAN}}d to hit that gap and did so easily\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, muscled over extra cover! Full and in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and lifts it powerfully. No protection in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, class apart. It's a short delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} arches back and guides it to perfection over the empty cordon, third man sprints to his left but it's one bounce and over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 116.8kph and {{BATSMAN}} is waiting for it. {{BOWLER}} has to mix it up. This one had width as well, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat at the right time to bisect backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, {{BOWLER}} drops one short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it and cuts it late, beats backward point to his right and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sheer exhibition on how you time your muscle. {{BOWLER}} tries cramping up the room and {{BATSMAN}} wrists a short arm pull, through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, comes dancing out of his crease, the length was music to him and slaps the ball down towards long-on for a one bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fine square cut by {{BATSMAN}} again. Was short and wide outside off and the Sunrisers skipper did well to time his cut as he beat sweeper cover with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and {{BATSMAN}} signs off with a four! An angry {{BATSMAN}} walks off. That 'could have been wide ball' playing on his mind. Was fuller, missed the mark though, and {{BATSMAN}} butchered it between deep cover and long-off. Sped into the fence in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full and too close to {{BATSMAN}}, who just lifts it back over the bowler's head. Hit clean and hard, no chance for long-off or long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's been hammered. A half-volley, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and drills it straight down the ground. {{BOWLER}}, in his followthrough, moves away from it. Rockets away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, this is turning out to be a fine cameo from {{BATSMAN}}, comes down the track, uses his reach to good effect and clears cover with the lofted off-drive, couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, little backing away movement supplemented with fine hands. The ball threads into the gap on the off-side and the ball races away into the cover fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot! Good use of the feet. He left the crease and did not allow {{BOWLER}} to change his length, right in the slot and he creams the drive straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery and {{BOWLER}} pays for it. 9 runs off the first three balls. The off-pace delivery is on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} glances it fine and picks up the second boundary of the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and now four more. {{BOWLER}} fired that fuller and faster on the stumps, a powerful drive and Warner at mid-off is slightly wide, so can't get there and once he did, didn't dive. {{BATSMAN}} is hurting SRH\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is gentle pace from {{BOWLER}}. At 127kph, he has tried to bang it in short. The ball sits up for {{BATSMAN}} and he pulls it off the waist through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty on {{TEAM}} debut! The big boss is owning the evening. That was in the zone, too full and the batsman thumped it down the ground for a four. One bounce and it escapes into the fence. And look at the big man, he does the cradle act with both his arms. He is thrilled to bits\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length delivery angling in from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it by getting across, shapes up to scoop, gets enough on it to paddle it away past Dhoni towards the fine leg boundary for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now over third man. Just bounces inside the ropes and hits the cushions on the half-volley. {{BOWLER}} bowled it short again but shifted the line to outside off, and {{BATSMAN}} nicely ramps it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finds the gap this time. Just past a diving mid-on to his right. Fuller ball attacking the stumps, forced away off the front foot past the bowler. Once it beat the infield, it was always going to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, threatens to come down. Charge down in fact. All he does in the process is fool {{BOWLER}} into thinking the same and fire one wide. Adjusts and reaches out in slapping it behind point. A confidence boosting boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, Harbhajan leaped at first slip, might have got a finger-tip on that, but there was no way he was catching it. {{BATSMAN}} came down the track to a floaty outswinger, gets a thick edge as he slapped, the edge just about cleared the leaping first slip fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done! {{BATSMAN}}'s off the mark with a boundary. That was all about precision. A length delivery angled across him and the Australian all-rounder guides it through the gap at point and short third man. Couldn't have placed it any better\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} greets the new bowler with a boundary. Shortish ball at 139.7kph, {{BATSMAN}} stays back in the crease and pulls it straight of mid-on. He got it almost off the toe end, but that's more than enough to run away for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} keeps dealing in boundaries. He waits for the leg-break to arrive and dabs it past Rohit at slip, placed it fine enough and beat Bumrah behind square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fired down leg, {{BATSMAN}} is late on the expansive fine sweep, gets some bat on it though, and gets it away to the fine leg fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the previous shot forces {{BOWLER}} to pitch it short and {{BATSMAN}} makes merry. Goes back and pulls it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's a long on this time but it has gone too straight. {{BOWLER}} once again teases his luck with a fuller ball. {{BATSMAN}}, who was backing away, on-drives this one with a loft. Finds the fence with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, front foot no-ball and bang! {{BATSMAN}} whups a full toss with over a leaping backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the runs seem to be coming thick and fast. {{TEAM}} want to finish this early so we can start the second game on time. Back of a length and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slaps it past mid-off. Not where he intended but the end result is what matters\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shoddy from McCullum. You rarely associate that word with him. Full delivery on off, {{BATSMAN}} jams the drive into the pitch and bounces over {{BOWLER}}, McCullum from mid-off runs across and lets it through. No one to cover him and that's four more to {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}, his first for {{TEAM}} - tossed up quicker and sliding down leg, he bends half-way down and sweeps it behind square on the on-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} spotted that early, a much needed boundary for {{TEAM}} that. Waited for the off-cutter, stood his ground and heaved it over mid-wicket. No chance for AB to pull it back in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, head on. The battle continues. With {{BOWLER}} keen on cramping him up with the short pepper gets it barely up to the ribs. Just when he spots the bat going flat and the face pointing upwards in hooking it away. Behind square it flies\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} misses his mark and {{BATSMAN}} dispatches it duly to the fence. Hurls in a low full toss just outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} stri{{BATSMAN}}s out and drills it - skews it off the bottom part but enough to beat mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 115.9kph, it's a larget buffet. {{BOWLER}} tries overcorrecting, goes short, on the hips and swats don't really get any easier - whacking it once again into fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball outside off, dispatched by {{BATSMAN}} who hasn't put a foot wrong so far. Camps back and cuts it through point. {{BOWLER}} shakes his head in disappointment\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} hurls one fuller and {{BATSMAN}} decides to go after it. It was bowled wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} comes down for a walk and muscles it over the bowler's head to collect his third boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is class batting. He is toying with the field. Third man was inside the ring, Bhuvi bowled a short of length leg-cutter and {{BATSMAN}} opened the bat face to guide it behind square on the off-side - between backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is switching gears now. But he is aided by {{BOWLER}} here. Juicy full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and slaps it over extra cover, no chance for the sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, that's down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} misses the flick, the ball beats the keeper off the thigh pad and goes for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a shimmy but stays in the crease and slog-sweeps, to the right of deep mid, in the gap and well placed to get a one bounce over the ropes four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a juicy full toss. Had to be dispatched. It sure was. But almost laterally opposite to where he was looking for. Tries punching it through the covers, gets it a lot more of the edge than he would have liked and gets it through the cordon. The half-ton of the stand comes up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sliding in on leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} picks the line early, bends his back knee and swings it backward of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more runs! Just the momentum {{TEAM}} were needing after a lull phase. {{BOWLER}} errs on the shorter side and there is width as well, {{BATSMAN}} holds his shape and slaps the cut behind point. Fifty for SKY\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} picks the length quickly. Stands tall and pulls it well in front of square. Gets his third boundary with that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, typical {{BATSMAN}} there. Full length delivery around off, gets down on his knee and sweetly times his inside out shot over covers, looked pleasing to the eye that shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Rahul, Agarwal and now {{BATSMAN}}. All Karnataka boys have got off the mark with a boundary or six tonight. Full length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} keeps his head still and drills it past the fielder at mid-off, no chance to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full on the sticks, nothing really wrong with the ball. But {{BATSMAN}} moved across his line and slogged the ball away to the deep mid region for a four. {{BATSMAN}} is getting some momentum for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, thank the injury. When you can't run, you slog. {{BATSMAN}} sits, uses the line already down leg to sweep. Hard. Behind square. One-bounced\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fuller and channelling away, {{BATSMAN}} lifts the ball away over cover and that is a four. One bounce into the fence. These death overs are his territory and {{BOWLER}} is messing up his lengths as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how lucky is {{BATSMAN}}? This could have easily chopped on. Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} plays it with hard hands and gets an inside edge that goes past the stumps and all way to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pitched up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and hammers it straight past the non-striker. No-one's stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half-tracker and {{BATSMAN}} dismisses it from his presence. Ruins a good over from {{BOWLER}}. Went back in a flash and clouted it brilliantly in the gap between deep mid-wicket and deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, should have been stopped by Chahal there. {{BATSMAN}} leans ahead and times his square drive to beat the leggie's dive at point. First one of the innings for Delhi and their skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh the deft. Some width, {{BATSMAN}}'s surgical, waiting on it, shedding that brutal muscle, putting some nerves to use, dabbing it between point and short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, magnificent. Shimmies out to meet the pitch and bullies it through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, quick, short, outside off. Never mind it spinning back in, {{BATSMAN}}'s already deep enough in the crease and very cheekily dabbing it off the keeper's gloves\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a pacy full-toss on the pads, 142.4km/h, whipped away with utmost ease to the deep mid-wicket fence for four. All timing.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a certain {{BOWLER}} Kumar yorker that's becoming famous by the day, quite beating his physique. Slightly leg-sidish and {{BATSMAN}} gets just enough tickle on this. Through fine leg. Boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's fodder! Maxi wants to finish it off ASAP. Uses the strong bottom hand to whip it in the air over mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, geez! AB would be proud of that shot. The reverse scoop. Yes, he has played a reverse scoop off a fast bowler. {{BOWLER}} went full and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} kept his balance and spooned it over short third man. Even Kohli seemed impressed with that shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wasn't in control, {{BATSMAN}}. Overpitched outside off, he went so hard on the drive that the poise was lost and his bat-face opened up - slicing it uppishly past backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's such a poor idea to remove the slip without seeing through at least one over, Bhuvi does this time and again, now one escapes through the vacant cordon, a wide slip would have had him. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} looks to punch off the back foot, gets a thick edge that runs away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, don't want to jinx it but {{BATSMAN}} is one of the best batters of spin bowling. Sees a hint of width on this legbreak and jumps on it in a flash, opens the bat face and nails the cut behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. It's most likely his last game for the season and he wants to finish on a high. Shorter and wobbled away just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waited deep and slashed at it, thick outside edge runs away to the third man fence. {{TEAM}} dug-out up on their feet and {{BATSMAN}} acknowledges them with a raise of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boom! {{BOWLER}} is spraying it full, {{BATSMAN}} pouncing on it like a famished tiger. Uses his bottom hand power to biff it straight down the ground, whistles past the non-striker\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just over mid-on, not RCB's night? Short and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} backed away on the pull, gets it right off the bottom of the bat, but has enough to clear mid-on for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball to finish the over. And {{BATSMAN}} won't let those go. It's short and wide.. well not that wide but wide enough for {{BATSMAN}} to stay back and crack the cut past point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is losing his radar a bit here and probably, confused with his lengths too. Goes very full but it's on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} gets a tickle on it. More of the inside half and it beats de Kock down the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, errs in length and pays the price. {{BATSMAN}} is too good to not miss out on these. Takes a giant step forward, uses all his power to muscle it down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, showed glimpses of form in the previous game too. This is short around off, {{BATSMAN}} camps back and punches it well past the fielder at mid-off, placement was bang on there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fantastic Faf! All about timing, this shot. Shimmies down the track and although the ball sticks into the surface - the class of {{BATSMAN}} takes over. Goes inside out with a checked lofted drive and manages to beat Surya at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another massive over for Mumbai. Again, {{BOWLER}} offers a full toss, {{BATSMAN}} frees his shoulders and clouts it wide of long-on, Maxi runs to his left and tries to keep the ball back in play but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more of the pace offered. This time {{BATSMAN}} forces it through the line. 142kays again and a front footed smear through the covers. Ah, elegance all over it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is the form talking. Shimmies down and though he isn't close to the pitch of the ball, but still goes through with the loft over extra cover, one bounce and over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide, a slash at that, and just wide of a diving Rahul Chahar at backward point for four. {{BATSMAN}} is away. The confidence reflects in his conviction of the shots and his footwork.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 19 runs off the over. Raina's wicket has done nothing to slow down the scoring rate. Off-cutter on a length, {{BATSMAN}} just guides it past backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length delivery across off, {{BATSMAN}} opens the face on it to guide it past Pollard at short third man. If nothing else, it's a good chance for {{BATSMAN}} to play himself into some form. Or is it too early to write them off?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, quality from {{BATSMAN}}. No misjudging of the length this time, picks the long hop early and hacks it over square leg. Kind of short-arm jabbed it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has unintentionally played the perfect slice to split short third man and backward point. He just swings hard at this length ball, wanting it carve it over extra-cover. The bat face opens beautifully on impact and the ball pops perfectly into the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room, gets on top of the bounce and clatters it to the right of point, no stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball bouncer and SKY had just ample time to pick that off the back foot, he arches slightly and ramps it over the keeper with a touch of delicacy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fires it down leg, out of fear more than anything else, {{BATSMAN}} gets on his knee and gets some bat on it, deflects it away towards the (extremely) fine leg boundary for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh excellent sweep shot, got low early with no one at deep square leg and absolutely smashed this shot from the middle of the bat to find the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunched, lovely cricket from {{BATSMAN}}, on a good length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} wasn't fully forward as he drove, the timing is sweet and the ball beats the fielder in the deep at cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is in overdrive in this Powerplay. Raining boundaries at the moment. {{BOWLER}} spills one on the pads and that's criminal with fine leg up. {{BATSMAN}} just gets a tickle on it and sends it racing past that fielder to the fence in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh dear. Spots {{BATSMAN}} running inside and fires one way down leg. {{BATSMAN}} with his stalking eyes always on the ball gets his bat out on the horizontal swiping mode and scoops it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nothing seems to be working. Starts with a short ball, {{BATSMAN}} camps back and pulls through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss and he's mishit this, yet it runs away for four. Long-on was very square and he had no chance of cutting this off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another edge, different result, elation previous, agony on this. That cut away from the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} edged it as he had a feel for it. The edge carried just past the diving tentacles of Karthik. Only if they had a slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and pumps it over cover. One bounce and into the fence. Running out of adjectives here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, almost a blinder at mid-off by Kohli! Dived swiftly to his left and had it in his left hand mid-air but couldn't hold on. RCB have spilled quite a few already tonight and though this isn't an easy one, you'd hope that some stick at least. Was a bludgeoning drive from DK and he couldn't quite keep it down. Nearly paid the price but eventually gets a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Duminy drops it at deep square and then also lets it go for a boundary. Low full toss, {{BATSMAN}} got into a position early and swiveled the hack round the corner. It was right upto Duminy, who went for the reverse cup but lets it through. What's worse: it bounces once before the boundary ropes. Bad. Very bad\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a big confidence-booster for {{BATSMAN}}. He wants runs and this is a fine shot. On the front foot and when he saw the back of a length delivery outside off, just knifed it on the rise. Through the vacant cover-point region for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how easy? Similar to the previous shot. An exact replica. A fullish one around off, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to get into position and scoop it over short third man once again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much needed boundary for {{BATSMAN}}. He was feeling the pressure. Waits for the flighted delivery to land and reverse sweeps it over backward point, came right off the meat as it raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now this is a back foot punch over covers. You have to see it to believe it. {{BOWLER}} is from over the wicket to the left hander here. Just a touch short, {{BATSMAN}} is so early there to get back and punch it up and over. Graceful, if it's ever been any more brutal\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finally a boundary for Delhi! It has come after ages. A wide full toss by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} makes sure it's sent to the boundary. Reaches out for it and slaps it past the man at cover, also manages to beat the sprinter in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the boundaries continue to flow.. Room to leg and that opens up the off-side field nicely for him, even though it is back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} thumps it on the up over extra cover. No chance for the sweeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed! Full length delivery outside off and Mayank absoutely belts it over covers as he finds the boundary once again. Went flat and almost cleared the boundary on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no more an IPL virgin. Pune goes loud and berserk as {{BATSMAN}} hits a century here. His first in the Indian Premier League. His first ever in Twenty20s. Backs away and slaps a drive through extra cover. What a gorgeous shot. Raises his bat after a fist-pump and screeches, in cramps and joy, err.. He's almost taken Pune home here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, up and over. This is good intent from {{BATSMAN}}. Shimmies down the wicket and gets a bit too close to the delivery, but still goes through with the loft and clears a leaping Russell near the mid-off ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 16 runs to end the powerplay. {{BOWLER}} tries to follow the backing away {{BATSMAN}} with a full {{BATSMAN}}livery, but ends up bowling it in the slot, pumped right back over and the ball bounces just insi{{BATSMAN}} the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back to back now! Another fuller ball and {{BATSMAN}} this time lofts the drive, not much of followthrough. Just an extension of elbow and off she goes, one bounce over the ropes at extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is just toying with the bowler. Well, {{BOWLER}} hasn't been on target as well. Full toss on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} walks forward and flicks it over the square leg umpire's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} at his best. Pitched up outside off, no movement and {{BATSMAN}} creams the square drive past the diving cover-point fielder. No chance of stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's into the toying around zone now. Dances down, inherits the ball in his slot and lofts it over the bowler. Effortless. The new bat I tell you\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, unlucky and {{BOWLER}} have been synonyms today. Full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws everything he's got at that and the outside edge flies away fine and {{BOWLER}} just stands there in his teapot position\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, geez! {{BATSMAN}} showing he has the innovative game. He set up for the heave, then wanted to scoop but since the line was outside off, he reverse scooped it over short third man and the connection almost took it the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hit-me delivery from {{BOWLER}}. Short and down leg, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and helps it over the short fine leg fielder. He's keeping the scoreboard moving swiftly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, proper batting from a proper batsman. Short of length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waits long enough on it as he steers the ball fine to beat Hardik at deep backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, yes, it is his night. Now an inside edge escapes past the stumps to reach the fence. Good length ball and {{BATSMAN}} backs away to swing across the line, the edge evades leg-stump and races to fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50 up for {{TEAM}}! {{TEAM}}, {{TEAM}} are the chants at the stadium. Short of a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} camps back and cuts it past the diving fielder at cover-point to add four more to the tally\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ends the over with a cracking boundary. This was short and width was there, enough for the batsman to go ahead with his square cut and find the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, on the charge. And the slap. The combo bags yet another fence hunter. Walks down, intercepts the length and gets on top of the bounce of this back of a length delivery in flaying it in front of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot. Slightly fuller than a good length on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} just biffed it over the bowler's head. Not a very good connection, but good enough to clear everyone. Breaks the shackles a bit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, consecutive fours for {{BATSMAN}} and the \"{{TEAM}}, {{TEAM}}\" chants are back. {{BOWLER}} wafts it full and gives some width for {{BATSMAN}} to free his arms. Lifted over mid-off, holds his shape nicely and desperate chase from the fielder but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is really struggling here. He is bowling all over the pitch. It was on a short of length and was down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} holds his shape nicely and powers the pull shot wide of fine leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, given as leg byes. Goes for the slower delivery but gets the radar wrong. Slipping down leg; beats the batsman and then the keeper too. 43 needed off 3 overs!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Ishant won't want to watch this, his drop has started to cost heavily already. Flatter one from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} gets across to sweep this well over short fine leg. Clean strike and more runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}, can't bowl short and wi{{BOWLER}} - when you have third man insi{{BOWLER}} the ring. {{BATSMAN}} went hard on the cut, gets a thick top-edge that cleared the inner ring, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} flat-bats a pull over a frustrated, crimson Russell, to the long-on fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of the free-hit. Slower ball from a back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} hangs back, stays leg-side of the ball and throws his bat at it to carve it over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, can't bowl short at 135.2ks to {{BATSMAN}}, he rocks back and nails the pull over mid-wicket. Couple of bounces and into the fence. {{TEAM}} will hope this can get AB going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half-volley from {{BOWLER}}, duly hammered back through mid-off. {{TEAM}} need a flurry of these to bring some life back in this contest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, belted! This time he connects and boy doesn't he pack a punch. Good length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and pumps it straight back over {{BOWLER}}, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how good a shot that is. Look at the placement. {{BATSMAN}} charges on the front foot, sees the length and shapes back, cuts and beats the man at point and then sweeper who ran to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball outside off, a response to {{BATSMAN}}'s charge off the previous ball you'd think. And {{BATSMAN}}'s expecting it. He waits on the back foot and slaps it through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this shot will get the Delhi crowd going! It was on a back of a length and was attacking the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} moves to the off-side a touch, clears leg-side for himself and tonks it over short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ends the over with a poor ball. Darts it short, {{BATSMAN}} rockets back and pulls it fiercely through the mid-wicket region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary for {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}}. Full and on the pads, needed to be put away and {{BATSMAN}} did just that, picked it up and dispatched it over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he is cracking those off the back foot. And the length from {{BOWLER}} is not helping the cause of Delhi. Bit of width, {{BATSMAN}} creates some more and cuts it past the man at point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third boundary of the over and KL Rahul immediately walks up to have a chat with the bowler. A juicy low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} with fast hands hammers it powerfully square on the off-side and threads the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, if the idea was to surprise {{BATSMAN}} first ball with a short one, it hasn't worked. He's in position quickly, leaning back, hitting the pull over square leg. Did take the eyes off it eventually, but still got it crack off the middle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice shot from {{BATSMAN}}! Targets straight boundary and hits it with a neat lofty drive down the ground, picked the full delivery around off and lifted it with ease. That is a really crucial boundary. Kohli talking to {{BOWLER}} about that ball, looks like he's telling {{BOWLER}} that he should've been defensive. Because these are two young players at the crease, may find it difficult against Steyn. Four vital runs given away. Credit to {{BATSMAN}} for smoking it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bludgeoned straight down the ground, don't bother looking back Mr Slinga-{{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, master of manipulating the field. There's a leg slip now instead of silly point, and the tossed up one on off is reverse-lapped to third man for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss outside off, driven through extra cover. The sweeper gives up. It's a 10-wicket hammering\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, nearly a fourth wicket for Shardul. This was a floaty delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} saw the width and went with hard hands on the drive, gets a thick edge that perfectly bisects the keeper and Christain at wide slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, heaves the pull away over mid-wicket. He was quickly in position for that. Short of length from {{BOWLER}} and the ball just sits up. {{BATSMAN}} drags it from outside off with a lot of muscle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gotta feel for {{BOWLER}}. This was a yorker just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waited and waited for it, opened his bat face and just guided it very fine at third man. Talk about placement and timing... wow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the partnership between {{BATSMAN}} and de Villiers is now 50. Slow through the air - 81.6kph, {{BATSMAN}} cuts off the back foot and Shami at backward point is too slow to bend down to his right. Doesn't get a hand on it and the ball reaches the fence in a jiffy. {{BOWLER}} isn't happy with that effort\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely stroke. {{BOWLER}} erred by gifting a low full toss on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} with that flourish of his wristed it away through square leg. Rajpoot was stationed well behind square and made a desperate attempt to get to the ball. In vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crashed away! The googly from {{BOWLER}}, but it's short and wide outside off. {{BATSMAN}} trks back and muscles the cut through extra cover. Lewis sprints across and dives to his left, in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Gayle who? 144.7km/h, all of it in vain because it's a half-volley outside off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't move his feet and plays a transfer of weight drive between extra cover and long-off for four!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, uppish and through Pollard's hands at short mid-wicket. Trademark {{BATSMAN}} whip. Clears his front leg and swats it off his pads. Pollard leaps but in vain. Races away to the boundary at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pure timing. Just put bat to ball and the timing will take care of the rest. The thing that coaches tell you. PP did just that to a leg-side dart, dances away to the mid-wicket fence beating a desperate dive from one of the fielders\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's never a dull moment when {{BATSMAN}} is out there. Premeditates yet again and scoops the floated delivery towards fine leg. The fielder was no where close to cut this down, neither inside the circle nor outside it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, so now some feet as well. This kid's putting up a show here, stepping away from the line, getting under the good length to go inside-out over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss and sliding down, helped past backward square leg. Easy delivery to get and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} jumps away from the path of this bullet-drive from {{BATSMAN}}. He had made the mistake of overpitching, but he wasn't going to make the mistake of risking himself once {{BATSMAN}} drilled it back. Smartly so\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bit like Guptill. Slogs across the line and the head is tilted downards. Slowish offie on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} swings across the line and gets good wood behind it. One bounce and into the fence. The man in the deep probably didn't pick it up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, skids through towards leg, {{BATSMAN}} steps across and sweeps, in the air for a while, and falls short of Kulkarni at fine leg who can neither catch it, nor stop it, as it goes away for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} arches back, opens the face of the bat and then runs it late - past the keeper, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, byes, FOUR, oh my! That must have slipped out of {{BOWLER}}'s hand. High full toss right at {{BATSMAN}}'s head, he does well to duck under it. The ball bounces just in front of Buttler and escapes past him. {{BOWLER}} immediately had his hands up apologetically\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's bread and butter for {{BATSMAN}}. Short, wide and he cracks it away. Went back in his crease and unleashed the cut shot behind square, beating backward point and third man quite comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is putting on a show here. He is 47 off just 18 balls. The short ball ain't working against him. {{BOWLER}} isn't learing, peppers it short without any purpose. {{BATSMAN}} is committed onto the front foot and flat-bats it over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! DD are still in this game. {{BOWLER}} angles it on a length, {{BATSMAN}} moves slightly leg-side and flat-bats it down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50 up for Delhi! A brilliant shot from the skipper. A fullish ball at 140.9kph, {{BATSMAN}} stayed in his crease and brought his down at the right time to knock it through the gap between mid-on and mid-wicket. Superb timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Punjab aren't going to turn this around with these deliveries. Short at the stumps, Faf crunches the pull between long-on and midwicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four to end! The drama continues. 20 to get in the last over. That was full, more of a half-volley as he missed the mark and the batsman brought all his sinews to play. Muscled past long-off, to his left for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, can't miss your length with this field. Since both long-off and long-on are wide. Full and outside off, blasted over the umpire's head. {{BATSMAN}} is playing a blinder here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tries to bowl the pacy full-wide ball from over the wicket but {{BATSMAN}}'s reached out and ushered it to the ropes off the toe-end. Through to square third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one bounce into the fence! Gets down on one leg and middles the slog sweep. Found the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, too full and too wide from {{BOWLER}}, he hasn't found the right line and length so far. {{BATSMAN}} leans into the drive, didn't get close to the ball, as a result it was in the air for a long time, but he found the gap to the left of cover and it scooted away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's harsh on the bowler. That didn't deserve to go to the boundary. It was banged in short and {{BOWLER}} bent his back there. {{BATSMAN}} is surprised by the pace and bounce on that delivery. He jumps and just sticks his bat out hoping that it doesn't hit him. The ball flies past the keeper off his shoulder and dribbles away into the third man fence. The umpire thinks it came off the bat and gives four runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and the extra delivery costs them a boundary.. Quick and drifting across the left hander, {{BATSMAN}} plays the late cut even though there's a slip in place, but the pace of {{BOWLER}} was too quick for Warner to react\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finds the gap between backward point and short third man. These are mostly off-cutters from {{BOWLER}}, which explains why third man is up. But this one has enough width on it, so {{BATSMAN}} can manufacture the pace with his hands as he cuts\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's not the greatest of deliveries from {{BOWLER}}! Short ball that sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} to pull it firmly behind square on the on-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} looks at the base of his bat. A rank long hop and he cue-ends the pull towards deep mid-wicket, Shorey runs around the rope and dives over the ball. Poor effort from him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tossed up teasingly outside off and {{BATSMAN}} says thank you very much. Leans across, picks it up and lifts it disdainfully over mid-off. Clean swing of the bat!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for the opener! This was slightly short in the channel outside off, {{BATSMAN}} treks back and slaps it wide of the fielder at sweeper cover, great timing and power on that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he is not hanging around, is he? Lines up for a full ball and when he gets one, he lauches {{BOWLER}} straight down the ground. Mid-off (running back) and long-on converge, in the process of stopping the ball they fear about the collision and lets it through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} almost strikes on his first ball, almost! Pitches this one up around the off-stump line, {{BATSMAN}} looks to defend this and ends up getting an inside edge. The ball whizzes past the leg stump and races away to the fine leg fence. Lucky start!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it, rocks back and nails the cut behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a horrible start for Thampi in this year's IPL. He gifts a boundary to {{BATSMAN}} who won't mind this at all. He opened the face of the bat for a single, Thampi was casual in getting down at third man. It goes through him for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, talk about presence of mind and there's {{BATSMAN}} with a bit of deftness. Short ball with third man inside the ring, unbelievable from the bowler. {{BATSMAN}} spots the field, just guides the ball over the infield to the third man fence. Sehwag smiles from the dug out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower length delivery and jhas been upper steered away past the short third fielder for a four. Was preempted and despite that being a slower ball, {{BATSMAN}} managed to usher enough pace on to the shot to get it past the fielder. Cheeky {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first ball for {{BOWLER}} and he has been punished. Fuller ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} unfurls a cracking drive through extra cover. Finds the fence, 100 up for {{TEAM}} finally\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries, short delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and pulls over mid-wicket, easy boundary, {{TEAM}} well ahead now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slapped past mid-off. Dismissive from {{BATSMAN}}. Sees a pitched up delivery outside off, loads up and absolutely smacks it off the meat with ferocity. All power from the {{TEAM}} skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slammed away! Rishabh {{BATSMAN}} announces his arrival at the crease in style. Picks the length early, camps back and punches it firmly through the gap at cover to get off the mark with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and even a yorker isn't spared. Reaches out for this outside off and squeezes it past the keeper. Third man was in the ring anyway\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, nice way to get your innings underway, back of a length and well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} waited on it, used {{BOWLER}}'s pace and then chopped it late - behind square on the off-side and into the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just past a diving Rabada! Was always difficult for him to take this but made a heroic effort nevertheless. Pitched by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} went for loft down the ground. Got it straight but Rabada from mid-on sensed it and moved swiftly to his left before diving mid-air. Past him and to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, almost cleaned up Raina at the other end. The leg-break is right in the slot for him, small step forward and murders the ball straight back, Raina was ducking for cover and the fielder at long-on didn't even try to chase that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is good batting, knows {{BOWLER}} isn't going to toss the ball up, so has a short backlift to reverse lap this flatter ball past short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not the smartest of bowling from {{BOWLER}}. The deep fine was in and {{BOWLER}} bowls it short. {{BATSMAN}} hangs back and pulls it over short fine leg for a four. The Chennai crowd loving every bit of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is smashed. Belted by {{BATSMAN}} as he saw the short of length delivery outside off and didn't hold back. Went aerial over cover-point and gets four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short and too straight from {{BOWLER}}, on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads and it's neatly flicked away towards fine leg, beats CdG - running across from long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, raining boundaries off {{BATSMAN}}'s willow. Again moves away to leg-side, takes on this back of a length delivery and blasts it wide of mid-on. He didn't find the sweet spot but it doesn't matter anyway\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 34th fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! Gets there in style in. Slower ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches for it and smashes it through the gap at covers. Gets to the milestone and announces his return to form\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's guided this in the gap past backward point and it's running away for four. It was the slower delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} gets the placement right by opening the bat face at the last moment\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lack of pace but it's a half-volley outside off! {{BATSMAN}} leans onto the front foot and spanks the drive wide of the sliding fielder (to his left) at mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Cariappa has denied {{BOWLER}} his maiden wicket in IPL. Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} frees his arms and slashes hard, it goes flat and straight into the hands of KC Cariappa at deep point who lets it slips through his fingers and to make matters worse, it has gone over the boundary ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wonderfully done! Waits on it, and then dabs it away with an open face of the bat. Dhoni did spread his legs in anticipation but it nutmegged him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, the leg-spinner from {{BOWLER}}, drifted wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, opens the face of the bat and lifts it inside out over cover for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, is it a four? Or has Cottrell managed to push it back into the playing area? Seems to be a four. Went really fine and the man at short fine leg gave it a good chase. ABD shows his {{BATSMAN}}ft si{{BATSMAN}} as well. He is off to a flier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another slower ball outside off from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} reads the change in pace and drives it through the off-side for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide, poor bowling, and a gorgeous punch in front of deep point for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another boundary from {{BATSMAN}}. He is putting on a show here for Punjab. It was a slower one and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knees and sweeps it through fine leg for a boundary. Great connection!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}}'s stocks are on a free fall. Short, slow, {{BATSMAN}} gets into position and pulls it over short fine leg for a one bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Cummins was straighter at mid-off but {{BATSMAN}} still manage to beat him. Full delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swings through the line past Iyer and Cummins had no chance of getting across\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh, this is nicely done by {{BATSMAN}}. He's no mug with the bat. Picks the googly, waits and waits before dabbing it past slip. Has enough legs to reach the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball at 118.7kph, but {{BATSMAN}} picked that. It was shorter in length and the skipper had ample time to pick his spot. Stayed back and pummelled the pull over mid-wicket for a one-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drilled, length ball outside off and {{BATSMAN}} drilled it back at the bowler - was a chance but {{BOWLER}} had little time to react, raced away across the fast outfield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of the free-hit. Bends his back knee and crunches the cover drive wide of the diving extra cover fielder. Once it cleared him, there was none stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! But {{BATSMAN}} won't mind. He's off the mark in this IPL with a boundary. Very full and on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} slogs and the inside edge evades the leg-stump, runs away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easily done. Short ball angling into the body, {{BATSMAN}} half-ducks and swats, the ball grazes the top edge and runs away...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} keeps stroking them beautifully at the other end. He clearly holds the fate of his team now. It's a full ball on off and {{BATSMAN}} has timed the pants of it as he flicks it through mid-wicket. The placement is brilliant too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh he wants a century. And Krishna surely is helping him to it. An overtly friendly drifter down leg, {{BATSMAN}} stays his ground, picks and dispatches it off his legs past the diving keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, attempted yorker length {{BATSMAN}}livery, errs on the fuller si{{BATSMAN}}, {{BATSMAN}} backs away into the on-si{{BATSMAN}} and gets low to slice it away behind point for four - his 4th fifty for the Mumbai Indians this season, and he raises the bat to the dressing room. A good recovery from him after a slow start. Can he finish off with a flourish?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back to normal pace and {{BOWLER}} suffers. Shortish length and {{BATSMAN}} waits to ramp it just wide of Rahul. Got it very fine and third man had no chance. Just a hit away now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} flicks through mid-wicket, oh big gap there and Pooran fumbles trying to slide and stop the ball. {{BOWLER}} looks away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stands tall in his crease and rockets the flat-bat smack back over the bowler, wasn't in complete control, but it had enough power to go all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flat and angling towards middle, {{BATSMAN}} switches his stance into a right-hander's, reverse-sweeps to third man for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot, good shot! Picks the length early on that. Was a shortish delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out on it and slaps it towards mid-off. Thampi who's manning that position slips as the ball beats him and goes through. That won't please the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has switched onto top gear! We could be in for some real carnage if he bats for a while. Attempted slower bouncer but {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line in a flash and pulls it easily over short fine leg. Proactive batting and {{BOWLER}} is under serious pressure here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, buckle up folks this is going to be some contest. Zak with his funky fields and {{BATSMAN}} trying to bisect them. Full and on off, almost a yorker length, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and whips it over backward square. The fielder was inside the ring and he was nowhere near the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the airrrr and just over the leaping Nortje at mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} jumped down the pitch and flat-batted that short of length delivery, hit it flat, Nortje is tall, tried his best there but it escaped.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mid-off inside the ring and {{BOWLER}} bowls it right in the arc for {{BATSMAN}}. He just gets under it and tonks it with a straight bat and clean swing over mid-off. Beautiful hands from {{BATSMAN}}. Ah, poses for the paparazzis as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how did he cut a ball that wasn't short! {{BATSMAN}} gave himself room and sliced the ball square past backward point, Ricky Bhui couldn't cut it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands at the cut, beats backward point to the deep backward point fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, you cannot miss your length by an inch against {{BATSMAN}}. It was marginally short and was directed on the body, {{BATSMAN}} gets in an excellent position and times the pull shot brilliantly. It goes over square leg and races to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he looks in great touch does {{BATSMAN}}. It wasn't that bad a delivery, just a little bit short. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and powers it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary. He bisected long-on and deep mid-wicket to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, guided away uppishly and just wide of Munro at short third man, short of length again from {{BOWLER}}, this time it's slightly outside off stump, Faf guides and gets four more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} got that wrong. Tried something different with the slower delivery, floated it up full and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} crashed the drive wide of mid-off. Left everyone motionless. Replays show that it was the knuckle ball from {{BOWLER}}, went wrong\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a 135km/h bouncer from {{BOWLER}}, but {{BATSMAN}} has picked it up, rocks back and nails the pull to the deep mid-wicket boundary for four. Not the best timing on that, but he's got it away...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pitched up on middle, {{BATSMAN}} swipes right across the line of it, and it somehow balloons off his leading edge over backward point. Third man was inside the ring, so it runs away for four. Back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow. So damn neat. A very tight cramping back of a length stuff, which {{BATSMAN}} waits, and waits on, lets it get really close to him before opening up his bat face and guiding it perfectly behind point, and toying around with the angle for third man to cut off either\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}! Full and straying on the pads, a lean across followed by a nonchalant flick over backward square leg. One bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a shot to start! Gee, {{BATSMAN}} has come out with a mission. Doesn't bother to have a look at {{BOWLER}}'s variation and opts for the reverse sweep straight away. It was the same shot that got Munro but {{BATSMAN}} connects well to send it soaring over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the short ball but {{BATSMAN}} backed away early to free his arms. Slashed at it with an open bat face to deliberately hit over the top through point for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! But {{BATSMAN}} won't mind it. He's off the mark with a boundary. The idea from {{BOWLER}} is to push it across the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} throws everything at the drive and the outside edge runs away fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's raining boundaries. Appalling start from Rahman, drifts it down leg and it's easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}. Gets some wood on it and tucks it to the right of short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for the opener. Picks the length early on the shortish delivery, rocks back and slams it into the gap at cover. Sweeper cover is too square to cut it off as the ball wins the race\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now {{BATSMAN}} gets a boundary. Short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} pulls it through mid-wicket and beats the fielder in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lots of clubbing in this. A 117.1kph slower cutter tried, digging it short, which {{BATSMAN}} goes right behind to in mowing it very agriculturally into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, makes contact on this occasion and the ball reaches the fence in a jiffy. Similar length - back of a length - normal-paced though. {{BATSMAN}} picked the length early and pulled it through the gap between mid-on and mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, massive over for {{TEAM}}, 19 runs off it. It is another edge and another boundary for {{BATSMAN}}. He runs down the wicket and looks to force the back of a length delivery through the off-side, the outside edge runs away quickly to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flogged away as he picked the slower delivery up like dead meat. Then muscled the ball away between deep mid and deep long-on to pick the bones out of it. {{BATSMAN}} was deep in his crease and waiting for the slower ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dishes out width outside off, and it's just too short as well. There may be a gully and a backward point, but {{BATSMAN}} lines up really well, opening up and delaying his cut to bisect those two\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more. Just the over {{TEAM}} need. Leg-cutter on a back of length, and although he's deceived by it, he's able to drag it away past short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} wants to have some fun now. Picks the slower short ball and thumps it over mid-wicket, no-one in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wonderful from {{BATSMAN}}. \"Such a dynamic player he is\" is the comment from Isa Guha on air. Greets {{BOWLER}} to the crease by chipping down the track, takes it on the full and lofted it with a clean swing of the arms over mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, this should give {{BATSMAN}} some confidence, back of a length and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall andc punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats cover and races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a fine shot! This is what he's known for. Charges down the wicket and drills this one past the bowler. {{BOWLER}} had no chance to stop it, nor did any of the fielders out there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clumsy from Smithy. Makes a royal mess of this one. {{BATSMAN}} blasts it hard off the back foot through extra cover. Smithy gets across, slides near the ropes but lets it through his boot laces. Into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, when {{BATSMAN}} is in form, he plays some audacious shots. This was not a bad ball by any means, length ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} swats it over mid-wicket and wide of mid-on. That was dealt with disdain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boy look at that strike-rate! He is watching the ball like a hawk tonight. Shuffles a long way across and scoops {{BOWLER}}'s slower delivery over short fine to bring up his fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, inside edgeeee and it's past the dive at short fine leg. Lucky boundary and it's down to 5 runs off the last ball. {{BATSMAN}} races down the pitch and slogs, gets a thick edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the streaky edge comes into play. Doesn't matter, it is the free hit. Throws his bat out at a wide delivery and takes the edge to ensure that it flies past second slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky. That's {{BATSMAN}}'s experience for you. Shortish in length around off, {{BATSMAN}} simply guides it down to third man and finds the fence again, can't keep a fielder so fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slippery conditions or too casual was CDG? The batsman biffed the full and wide ball over the bowler. The man at long-on did the slide well but the ball bobbled away after hitting the torso. Pressure is doing all the talking now. 31 needed now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now the finesse from the Australian. Had the width to play whatever shot he needed, he chooses to back cut it behind square on the off-side, splitting backward point and short third man to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, they're turning it on. {{BATSMAN}} joins the act now. Is mighty helped by a horror line always drifting down leg. Has to ensure that he gets some wood on it and he does it with aplomb. Gets enough to muscle it heave behind square and beat the lone man perched out there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done! It wasn't too wide, {{BATSMAN}} jumped back and slightly moved leg-side. And then, the lefty opened his bat-face to guide it fine of short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a gift dished out and {{BATSMAN}} accepts it with both hands. He needed that. Connects and collects four. A rank full toss fired by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} thumps it down the ground. Over the bowler's head and long-off had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, quickly onto the back knee to swat this leg-break through mid-wicket. Plenty of muscle from {{BATSMAN}} as he swishes it to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} are either scoring in boundaries or not at all. This one was a loosener on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} clips it past Khaleel at short fine leg. Although the pacer puts in a dive, he finds it difficult to get his hand to it, all the way to the fence she goes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, straight down the ground! Another slower delivery on a full length on middle, {{BATSMAN}} stays put and drives it straight back, almost takes down Shaw at the other end who takes evasive action and loses balance. Can't keep a fielder there as {{BATSMAN}} scores his first boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, follows violence with finesse. Nothing much wrong with the delivery from {{BOWLER}}, saw the batsman move to leg so kept it wider of off. But {{BATSMAN}} expertly flails his hands and uses the pace on offer to cream it in the gap at cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, too much of width on offer and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't let it go. Prods across and crashes it square past cover, the man in the deep has no chance. 17 runs from the over, a terrible one from {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no fuss from {{BATSMAN}}! Arrives and gets a boundary, with utmost ease. A friendly full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} shows the full face of the bat, {{BOWLER}}'s pace takes care of the rest. Raced past mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball, do I need to say more? {{BATSMAN}} hangs back, allows the hands to do the talking and powers the cut uppishly past the point fielder for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} unleashing! Gets a full delivery in his zone and he clubs it straight back over the bowler's head for a delightful-looking boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bit like Guptill. Slogs across the line and the head is tilted downards. Slowish offie on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} swings across the line and gets good wood behind it. One bounce and into the fence. The man in the deep probably didn't pick it up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, oh Quinton .. you may have heard of cups dropped, this is probably the cup misfielded. It was quick, really quick, and going well over the cut, and de Kock, in his quest to throw it quicker and stop the bye, ends up not collecting at all\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flurry of runs in the last few balls and suddenly {{TEAM}} are bossing this. Short of length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} beautifully swivels into the pull and helps it into the gap between deep square and fine leg. His timing's on fire\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now through the other side. A floater up on off, takes matters with the turn does {{BATSMAN}}, with a full-blooded inside-out drive. Doesn't even bother keeping it down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky but {{BATSMAN}} won't mind. The Chineese cut as they say. Full, dipping in around the blockhole area, {{BATSMAN}} flashes hard and a smidge of inside edge does the trick for him. Skims past the leg-stump and rushes down to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's just toying with them. It's his day today. {{BOWLER}} tosses this leg-break up outside off and {{BATSMAN}} swats the reverse-sweep away very fine. All intentional, all in control\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the crowd go berserk! A poor delivery on the torso, on the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} just gives it some topspin and swivels on it to deflect it away to fine leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ouch. Take cover Rod Tucker, {{BATSMAN}} knocked off his head nearly. Very full on off, the slower ball at 123.1 kph, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and hammered it straight down the ground ferociously. Tucker take evasive action and is on the floor\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} getting the momentum for {{TEAM}}. A low dipping full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} creams the drive past extra cover and long-off had no chance to get across\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the chat has worked. Virat offered some advice to {{BATSMAN}} and next ball the big man slaps one to the fence. A quicker delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes back and flays the cut, through point. Zooms away to the fence.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a poor ball, flighted and drifting down leg, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and then heaves it over backward square leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more! It was the googly from {{BOWLER}}, not sure if {{BATSMAN}} picked it. He went through with his lofted drive and slices it off the outside half. Over the cover region and that dribbles away over the bouindary rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no stopping that! Backs away, manufactures room and whacks the shortish delivery at he manages to beat the fielder at deep extra cover this time around\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky and four, {{BATSMAN}} must have faced {{BOWLER}} many a times at home - almost the perfect yorker, right at the base of off, {{BATSMAN}} somehow jams his bat down and squeezes it past the diving short third man fielder for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Archer is having a nightmare today. Pulled to the left of him at {{BATSMAN}}ep mid, he got there and picked up the ball with his left-hand, then inadvartently the right-hand flicked the ball onto the cushions. Tried to scramble and pull the ball back with a dive, to no avail\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh this is fantastic batting! Did they drop him for his bowling? Oh well well. Looks like we have Narine 2.0. Another half-volley outside off, this time it's lofted over the infield to the deep extra cover fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now {{BATSMAN}} uses the pace of {{BOWLER}} to pick up a boundary. He waits and waits for the ball to arrive, then at the last second opens the bat face and runs it past the slip fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how hard has he hit this! {{BOWLER}} looks to go wider to keep this away from {{BATSMAN}} but he reaches this and absolutely pummels this through the covers. No chance for sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full delivery and {{BATSMAN}} picked the bones out of that. It was in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} lofted it through the line ovr extra cover, couple of bounces and into the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 140kph .. and {{BATSMAN}} flashes hard. Full, wide and a thick outside edge on {{BATSMAN}}'s slap, but there's no slip, and third man's rather square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, makes room and does well by not going completely berserk with the shot. Had his eyes on the ball and slapped it past the man at backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 147.8kph. And dispatched at almost double the speed. {{BATSMAN}} - cleverly - stays deep in the crease, manages to get under the full length and drill it to bisect extra cover and mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short, too wide, carved away between point and cover point for a four. Got the room and got the boundary to get off the mark\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's such a poor start from the bowler. Short and way outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} cuts easily over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another {{BOWLER}} outfoxing. Faf continues coming down the pitch, {{BOWLER}} tries pulling his length back, but then Faf is happy to wait on it, present a nice full bat face in slapping it away over point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} seems to be in mood today. Shuffles across his stumps and dispatches a slower ball with a thumping flick wide of short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's checked this shot down the ground but it still races away off the middle. Back of a length and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} thinks about a cut but changes his mind midway and just jabs it back. The ball was in the air but {{BOWLER}} can't get down quick enough because it absolutely raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is a very vital cameo from {{BATSMAN}}, infusing respectability into the {{TEAM}} innings. Funny shot though, walked across the sticks for the paddle scoop and instead skied it towards third man. Very fine and Ngidi tried to get to it, even got a hand on it but could only palm it to the ropes. Dropped!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, quick legs. And quicker hands. {{BOWLER}} starts short with an off-break spinning into leg-stump, giving {{BATSMAN}} ample time to go deep in his crease and punch it away as he splits the two men on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, targets the mid-riff with another short delivery but the pint-sized dynamite is onto it in a flash! The short arm jab on the pull and the ball screeches away into the backward square region on the on-side for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lunges out at the ball and lofts it over mid-off. Interesting that he's gone after {{BOWLER}} first ball. The ball was full enough to execute the shot and he took his opportunity\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flat and slightly short, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and carves it over point. Two fielders chase, but can't chase it down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Samson dives at deep point, but this kept curving away from him. Was a short ball again and {{BATSMAN}}'s square-cut fetched him four runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he must be relieved. {{BOWLER}} tries a leg-cutter and ends up bowling a full toss, {{BATSMAN}} takes a step out to get under it and slams it straight back, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped! Henriques at deep square leg got across to his right and put in a dive, got his hand on it too but didn't stick. And worse, it trickled past him to the fence too. Did take a fine catch earlier and nearly had another really good catch to his name. {{BATSMAN}} was clearly rushed on the bumper and he managed only a top edge on the pull. Gets himself a useful boundary in the end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball at the body, {{BATSMAN}} looks to pull and gets an inside edge that runs away into the fine leg fence. No chance for the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 134.2kph, strays on the hips. Okay, this should help {{BATSMAN}}, it better help {{BATSMAN}}, with free runs off a fine leg-glance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the partnership between {{BATSMAN}} and M Pandey is now 50+. {{BOWLER}} caps the over with a poor, poor ball. Overpitches at his normal pace - must have been about 135kmph - and {{BATSMAN}} flays him back over his head. The shot was on. Andcredit to {{BATSMAN}} for reading the change of pace, for {{BOWLER}} was on the slower side for all the over but this. 37 off the last 3\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, muscled past mid-on. {{BOWLER}} dropping it a tad shorter, {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it. Sits deep, twirls his wrists and places it perfectly in the gap..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and he makes me eat crow with a dismantling cover drive. Actually not even that. Far from it. A bit of room on this fuller length delivery and he's slapped it through covers. Threw his hands at it and somehow made it look like the prettiest thing you'll see today\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much needed boundary for {{TEAM}}, on a good length and angling back into the right-hander, he uses the pace on the bat, opens up slightly and shovels it wide of mid-wicket. Mishra put in the dive - but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played, flighted on the leg-stump line, {{BATSMAN}} bends down low and then helps it over square leg with a half-lined sweep, couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just above the cover fielder. Can you believe it, he is teasing the fielders to the fullest at the moment. It was on a fuller length and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets it just enough bat on it to send it to fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stylish from {{BATSMAN}}. So after a terribly scratchy start, {{BATSMAN}} has managed to settle nicely. Poor full delivery on the pads, deserved to be put away, {{BATSMAN}} moved across the sticks just a touch to open up the backward square leg boundary and he placed the flick shot wide of the man at short fine to sign off the over in style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, like Kohli {{BATSMAN}} too gets off the mark with a boundary. Fraction short around off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and cuts wi{{BATSMAN}} of point. Expertly placed and it raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has carried on from where he left it in the 2018 IPL. His purple run in the pink and blue continues. Slower delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} pumps it over mid-off to bring about his fifty off 29 balls\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smacked! {{BATSMAN}} needs to get on with the game. Tossed up on off and middle, {{BATSMAN}} bents his back knee and powers the sweep in front of square, splitting deep backward square and deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, doesn't miss out this time! Short again from {{BOWLER}}, this sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} who crunches the pull over mid-wicket. Aerial but well over the infield and it races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off and running, no hat-trick of ducks for the big man. Too straight from {{BOWLER}}, ends up drifting onto {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he gets inside the line and helps it on its way, beats short fine leg and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stand and deliver from {{BATSMAN}}. Half-volley from {{BOWLER}}, begging to be hit and {{BATSMAN}} takes his front foot across and slams the drive with brute power past mid-off. Nobody moved and it sped off the bat in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bleeding runs. They have no clue how to bowl to these two at the moment. {{BOWLER}} pulls his length back but the width is there outside off, {{BATSMAN}} just slashes hard at it and gets a slice that beats short third man comfortably to his left. Not exactly where he intended but he won't mind\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is sheer stand-and-deliver stuff! Gets a length ball outside off with a hint of extra bounce, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't care one bit and thumps it over the mid-off fielder in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! He's bisected the two fielders with precision. 107ks knuckle ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and drives on the up past extra cover, where KW can't go full throttle on the dive as it is to his left and Rashid also can't get across from sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, went for the short delivery again, but took the pace off it, sits up for {{BATSMAN}} who slashes over point and beats sweeper cover running across\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dragged down short {{BOWLER}}livery and down onto the leg-si{{BOWLER}}, the batsman swivels on the pull and gets it fine past the man at short fine leg for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pulled away! Short of a length on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} picks the length on it and pulls it neatly over mid-wicket, on a bounce and over the fence there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} shifts his line over to off stump where {{BATSMAN}} is waiting after clearing his front leg. Just sets up brilliantly to smoke this flat-batted over mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunched! {{BOWLER}} pounds it short of length around off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and punches it through the crowded off-side field, the ball races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, carnage! Haven't seen a better knock from him. Was a full toss and {{BATSMAN}} made sure to time his flick through mid-wicket. {{TEAM}} chants in the crowd as the batsmen are showing no mercy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed! Punjab are just a hit away from winning this. It was a fuller length delivery and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, makes room and thumps it wide of deep cover for a boundary. It rockets to the fence!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, past Samson's one-handed effort at backward point. An uppish cut shot that he placed just wide enough of the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's {{BATSMAN}}'s strength. He is so good with the cut shots. Just can't keep him calm by bowling it wide of off, plants his back foot deep and thumps it away past backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's fetched this googly from outside leg stump and reverse-swept it through backward point. Incredible shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, take that. You bowl length at your own peril. {{BOWLER}} learns it the harsh way. A mighty swing of the bat and a punishing drill through the covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a bit of outswing on a good length outside off, a hint of seam away, but {{BATSMAN}} just check-drives it through the line to sweeper cover for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, steps down and almost loses the balance but does well to slap it past point. How often does he do he something like that? Pretty often\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets it between his own legs and gets it for four. So unfortunate for {{BOWLER}}. It's a cracking delivery this. Almost a yorker at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} tries to whip it away but nutmegs himself off a thick inside edge and splits square leg and short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, so much time for {{BATSMAN}} against someone of {{BOWLER}}'s pace. The ball is short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} plants his back foot a foot outside the off-stump to get to the ball and then slices it away past backward point into the boundary. Brings up two milestones with this one shot. Another fifty for him, as well as 6000 T20 runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, you cannot bowl short with fine leg up in the circle. {{BATSMAN}} knows where the fielders are and he pulls it over fine leg. The connection was good enough and it runs for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, spoils a good over by pitching it too full. It's a blistering drive through extra cover from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full ball outside off, not quite in the blockhole, and {{BATSMAN}} uses that error in length to slice it through past backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, each and every run will hurt Uthappa. A short of a length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out for it and punches it through covers as he beats the fielder's dive inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's superbly played. Waits on the ball and back-cuts it through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ungainly loft but {{BATSMAN}} manages to clear the in-field on the off-side. Cutter outside off, {{BATSMAN}} threw it all, lost his shape but the power of his willow takes it all the way to the fence. Iyer with a desperate chase, but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there he comes racing down the pitch to the offie with the ball turning in and plays the lofted drive, didn't connect with the middle of the bat, toe-ends it well enough to beat mid-off into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} has lost his line in the last 10 balls or so. Strays on the pads and that is easy pickings, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it in front of square and Tahir's dive was nowhere close to the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is finally getting into his groove. This was fraction short and he was quick to pick the length, rocks back and pulls it in front of square - bisecting long-on and {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length into the body, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across on the back foot and helps the pull behind square. He's placed it in the gap perfectly. Fine leg and deep square leg have no chance. {{BATSMAN}} taking {{BOWLER}} on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, decides to take matters into the leg-side. Reaches out to the pitch of the delivery and forces it with a dragging slog bisecting the men guarding cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 141.8kph, pitches it up in the slot .. and {{BATSMAN}} drills it straight down, lofting it over {{BOWLER}}'s head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this looked intentional from {{BATSMAN}}. Shows off his dexterity. Lenght delivery cutting back in just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} uses the pace and opens his bat face at the last moment in running it past short third man, who's dive went in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smash-me delivery. No real intent on that delivery. It just kept arrowing down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} helps it to the fine leg fence with a real muscular pull\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clubbed over point! First confi{{BATSMAN}}nt shot from {{BATSMAN}} for the night. Short and wi{{BATSMAN}}, he stands tall and bashes it square through the off-si{{BATSMAN}}. Didn't connect cleanly enough but had enough wood to clear the infield with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, away to the boundary, but that's not enough. What irony. The one ball which {{BOWLER}} has nailed into the blockhole has gone to the ropes. {{BATSMAN}} is beaten by it, the ball hits his boot, misses leg-stump by a whisker and leaves the keeper wrong-footed. But it's game over with eight needed off one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more runs! {{BATSMAN}} is shifting gears now. This was a touch too straight in line and he just shuffled across to help this away past short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another short one, this time across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} tries to cut it away, gets a top-edge over the fly slip and towards fine third man for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fired in on the stumps again, lap-swept expertly to fine leg for four. Knew where the short fine fielder was and got it well past him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, on the legs at full pace. {{BATSMAN}} gets a tickle, and that's all he needed to .. into fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, placed to perfection. Flighted on middle, {{BATSMAN}} sinks down to one knee and sweeps, not quite off the middle, but got it in the gap at deep square leg. The fielder tries to flick the ball in play, but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 16 off the over. Short, seam-up delivery outside off, cracking cut well in front of square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just eludes Rayudu's outstretched right hand. {{BOWLER}} lands the slower ball on the middle stump, {{BATSMAN}} gets low and slogs it across the line. Rayudu tried his best at square leg, but it evaded him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh no! Cummins has made a mess of it. Meanwhile, {{BATSMAN}} reaches his fastest IPL fifty. He has to bat through and ensure his side get the total they need. Full delivery on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it uppishly to wide long-on, the ball lands just in front of Cummins and he ends up overrunning the ball.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bangs one short does {{BOWLER}} and there's no venom. {{BATSMAN}} fetches it from well outside off and swivel-pulls it in front of square on the leg-side. He was in total control of the shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lofted over mid-off! He picks the slower ball, the length was pretty full outside off and {{BATSMAN}}'s focus is purely on timing. Doesn't go very hard at it. Brilliant batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short delivery down the leg. Not the ideal length to be bowling at that pace for {{BATSMAN}}, who waits for the ball and turns it to vacant deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, delicate now -- lining up, opening his bat face and bisecting backward point and short third man. yep, he's officially found his gear box\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery from {{BOWLER}}! Bowls a slower ball but he's dished it on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, tickled away past short fine. Easy!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} comes round the wicket and bangs it in short. {{BATSMAN}} slightly moves across and goes with his pull shot. He wasn't under control, but got enough wood on it to send it wide of the keeper. The boundary also brings up the 50-run stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has switched onto top gear! We could be in for some real carnage if he bats for a while. Attempted slower bouncer but {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line in a flash and pulls it easily over short fine leg. Proactive batting and {{BOWLER}} is under serious pressure here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how hard has he hit this one! Boy, that's some power from {{BATSMAN}}. Charges down the track and makes room to create width. The length wasn't all that short but he clobbered it over cover. Rocketed away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, BOOM! Flat bats the short ball and Warner at long-on had no chance to grab that. Even the FEDEX would have been proud of that forehand smash\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, steers the ball through point for four. Good length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}}'s feet don't move a lot as he opens the bat-face and guides the ball in the gap. The timing stands out again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's nicely played. Full and well outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} waits for the ball to come and square-drives it past backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finesse followed by power. So smart from {{BATSMAN}}, saw the quicker ball and stays rooted to the crease. Uses the pace and opens his bat face to guide it in the pocket between backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full floater on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} drills it to the right of a diving Imran {{BOWLER}}. Long-on can't get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shortish, marginally wide, {{BATSMAN}} just stays back and focuses on the placement - carves it away towards the deep backward point fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, for some reason switches to a half volley. {{BATSMAN}}, waits, buries and meets it with a full-blooded lofted drive through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundaries starting to flow for {{TEAM}}. They need to move on here. {{BOWLER}} has been too full today and this was no different, googly overpitched and {{BATSMAN}} drills the drive through extra cover. The fielder at long-off didn't even bother to chase\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now that is a top shot! The change of pace, but {{BATSMAN}} has great eyes. Picked that from the bowler's hand, delayed his shot, opened up the front leg and used his wrists so well to lift it inside-out over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's his answer to {{BOWLER}}, short of a length and angling across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was backing away, has to reach out and carves it over cover, a few bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, class from {{BATSMAN}}! Sees the outswinger pitch in the fullish zone and shows the full face of the bat to silk a gorgeous straight drive past mid-off. Too good!!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stands tall on his back foot and delivers a perfect pull does Yuvi, picked the right spot to place it too. No-one at deep mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, again greatness from AB. Got close to the swinging slower knuckle ball, but used his bottom hand to great effect, squeezing down on it hard and beats mid-on to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cute, {{BATSMAN}} is taking {{BOWLER}} to the cleaners - another proper cricketing shot, back of a length and well wide of off, he waited on it, opened the bat face and ran it behind square on the off-side, third man was inside the ring and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picks up the slower ball early but doesn't time it as well as he would have liked, but he gets enough bat onto it to get a four to fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the signature {{BATSMAN}} straight drive! Like Curran, {{BOWLER}} also starts with a half volley. The {{TEAM}} skipper leans forward and strokes it past the bowler and beats the diving mid-off fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pulls and pulls well. Bhuvi gets a bad bounce at deep mid-wicket. And that will result in another boundary for {{BATSMAN}}. It is getting from bad to worse for SRH!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, throws his hands at it and slices it flat-footed over covers. It's all but over....\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nothing wrong with that, a back of a length delivery @137.1km/h, {{BATSMAN}} stays stable on the backfoot and opens the face, surgically bisects the field behind point for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 105.6kph. Yorker. Leg-lined. {{BATSMAN}}'s wrists are quicker, with a lot of bottom-hand flicking it away behind square. Kuldeep sweeps from fine leg, dives, and his palm can only parry it over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 15 runs of {{BOWLER}}'s first over! Rajasthan couldn't have asked for a better start. Another floated delivery around off, that doesn't spin much. {{BATSMAN}} moves to an extent and creams it through the gap at covers yet again. Three boundaries in the over and the Royals are off to a flier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just a little full from {{BOWLER}}, and {{BATSMAN}} has sussed out that there's little swing here. So he's not afraid to hit through the line as he lofts it over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clips it fine after getting across. Fetches a four to the fine leg fence to bring up his fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the signature Virat {{BATSMAN}} cover drive! Short cover got a hand on it, mid-off tried to get to his left and put in a slide but it beat them both en route to the fence. Too full from {{BOWLER}} and it's creamed away off the front foot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes on the back foot and cuts it well, beats deep backward point for a boundary. Welcome boundary for {{TEAM}}!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, absolute gift! Full toss, little dip on it but the batsman lifts the ball away easily over mid-off's head for a four. This will break the shackles\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 141ks short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} exposes his stumps and throws everything at it, gets a massive outside edge and it races down to the third man boundary in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now a one-kneed stylish slog-whip over deep square leg. {{BOWLER}} fired it in and sees it flying round the corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, normal pace delivery and {{BOWLER}} is put away over mid-on. Back of a length and {{BATSMAN}} gets into a good position and pumps it over the fielder inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 22 runs of {{BOWLER}}'s opening over! The required run rate is down to 6 within a span of 6 deliveries. {{BATSMAN}} treks back and chips the short ball over the infield at wide mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full pitched at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} - with his high backlift - punches it sweetly over mid-on. With his flourish as it is, if the timing is good, he doesn't need to worry about clearing the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, drops his length short and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} is all over it like a rash, slaps it past cover and collects his first boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice shot to end the powerplay.Eleven runs off the over. {{BOWLER}} slightly tosses it up, {{BATSMAN}} hangs back and flicks it wide of mid-on. Once it cleared the fielder, there was none to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, throws his hands out. He's already given himself width with his exposed stance. Swings, uppish and slices it with ease over point. Never mind the mistime\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pitched up by {{BOWLER}} and it has been lofted over extra cover by {{BATSMAN}} to end the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft by {{BATSMAN}}. This is sliding down leg and on the shorter side as well. He just gets across to get a tickle that beats Klaasen. Quick outfield and short fine leg's chase is in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, timing isn't something {{BATSMAN}} has made a name out of, but if these continue, we'll need a rethink. Archaism, I tell you. Gets a delivery on the pads and times the hell out of it through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice way to get going, tad shorter and wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to rock back and pulls it high and over mid-on, a few bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how about that for timing? Geez! A fairly good delivery from {{BOWLER}}, angles this on a good length and {{BATSMAN}} just pushes it with a straight bat past the bowler. Just a gentle-looking push but it speeds across the turf to the fence in no time. Wow!! Shot of the day?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a shot to start! Gee, {{BATSMAN}} has come out with a mission. Doesn't bother to have a look at {{BOWLER}}'s variation and opts for the reverse sweep straight away. It was the same shot that got Munro but {{BATSMAN}} connects well to send it soaring over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shortens his length as {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track, and {{BATSMAN}} just adjusts his shot to flat-bat it through deep extra cover for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery and {{BOWLER}} knows it immediately. Drifts it way down leg and {{BATSMAN}} helps it along the way with a bit of glove, the fast outfield takes care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, Pant had no chance. 147kph bumper that kept climbing, {{BATSMAN}} ducked under it and evaded it with ease, but unfortunately Pant couldn't glove it even with a full stretch upwards\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, hint of width outside off. {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, opens the face of the bat and guides it past the slip cordon, no one in the deep and the ball rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Hooda was hoodoo-ed there! Drops a skier at deep mid-wicket. The short ball it was, {{BATSMAN}} took on the bait and managed a huge top-edge. The fielder in the deep made a meal of it as it went through his hands and to make matters worse, the ball bobbled away into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh shot. Nailed this pull shot through mid-wicket. Solid response after the previous ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} also gets into the act. Short and lacked venom, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and pulls it backward of square, he rolled his wrist to get the placement right and there was no stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, buffet ball, as Geoff Boycott would say. Short and offers enough width, {{BATSMAN}} skips back and knives with a solid punch, the timing was brutal and it beats extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely from {{BATSMAN}}, tad fuller and wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, drives it on the up and finds the gap past cover-point, the timing is sweet and the ball rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is giving it all. Backs away to this fuller ball and slices it past the ring, races to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 18 off 7! He is playing a gem. Backs away on this delivery, creates his own room, wanted to cut it wide of backward point. Gets an oustide edge and it ends up fine of short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a I-don't-want-you-to-be-a-bowler hit. Takes his front leg out of the way and flat-bats {{BOWLER}} over his head. Disparaging hit. Utterly disdainful\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, falls short of the man in the deep. Off-speed short ball, {{BATSMAN}} swivel-pulls and isn't quite control of his shot. Samad comes in from deep backward square leg and dives forward. The ball bounces in front of him and goes past him for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's the third boundary of the over. {{BATSMAN}} is showing no mercy against {{BOWLER}}. Another short delivery down the leg side, {{BATSMAN}} does well to drag it down to the long-leg fence. 15 runs of that over and {{BATSMAN}} moves into the 40s\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant stop from Mathews. But did he touch the cushions? The third umpire has a look and spots something in contact with the triangles. Short delivery and {{BATSMAN}} pulls in front of square, Mathews ran in from deep square, dived and stopped the ball, but it was spinning back towards the rope and he flicked it in and that's when he was in touch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good shot! Fraction short and this time {{BATSMAN}} sits deep in the crease for the cut. Beats the diving point fielder and it races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful! Such a good cricketing shot. {{BATSMAN}} backs away to go inside out, {{BOWLER}} fires it on the stumps, enough room to loft it handsomely over extra cover. One bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark with a boundary. Watto tries his best to stop it at short third man, but just couldn't get across. Fraction short and around off, {{BATSMAN}} manages to chop the cut behind square and Watson's dive is just an after thought. The sweeper also dives in vain near the boundary rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is already winning the mental battle. {{BOWLER}} goes for the yorker and misses it, the low full toss outside off and {{BATSMAN}} spoons it over the off-side field, the fast outfield does the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pressure on the spinners as the openers are in complete control. Boundaries coming from both ends. {{BATSMAN}} gets to the pitch of this delivery and whacks it over the bowler's head for four runs. {{BOWLER}} is running out of ideas\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss, {{BATSMAN}} crouches a bit and batters it to the right of Jofra at mid-on. Runs away to the fence and {{TEAM}} win by 8 wickets\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball outside off, seemed like an intentional dab from {{BATSMAN}}, although Warner wasn't far from getting a hand at slip. With the pace of {{BOWLER}}, this absolutely flew off {{BATSMAN}}'s bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} does the most of the full length delivery, stays deep in the crease and opens himself up to free his arms, smashes it straight down the ground and even a quick Warner could not reach that from long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 141kph. And an inside edge allows {{BATSMAN}} the move on. He tries going against the line, pulling, without judging the length not being short enough .. inside half, and Pant diving behind deflects it into fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh, this is wayward stuff from Krishna. Another loosener down leg and {{BATSMAN}} tucks in the gift. Moves across, allows for the ball to arrive and glances it past short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} isn't afraid of the mystery bowler, gets down low, uses his reach to good effect and sweeps it to the right of square leg, beats the diving fielder and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, raining boundaries in the Powerplay. Just the kind of start {{TEAM}} were looking for. Too full from {{BOWLER}} and it's hammered straight back past him and down the ground. Mid-off had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, eye-pleasing! Yes there was width on offer, but still had to be put away. On a short of length, {{BATSMAN}} stays put in his crease and then the there's the perfect eye-hand combination. Caressed through point with a horizontal blade\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's no way soft. No way near to soft. Back of a length again and this time {{BOWLER}} angles it in. Umm, only for {{BATSMAN}} to swivel and pull that round the corner. Used that incoming angle to his advantage, does {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, the best of the lot, it was a long half-volley from {{BOWLER}}, on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he presses across and flicks it in front of square on the on-side, the man in the deep has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sublime stroke! Most people would have tried slogging this but not {{BATSMAN}}. Uses his timing and placement to find the fence. Full and wide outside off, unfurls the drive with finesse past a diving extra cover fielder. There wasn't any protection in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is what he's here for! Short of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and slashes this over backward point. One bounce and into the hoardings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, driven hard enough to burst through {{BOWLER}}'s hands. Races away to the boundary. It wasn't an obvious drive-ball so to say, but it might as well be over here.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, won{{BATSMAN}}rful adjustment from {{BATSMAN}}. It was length outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} sits low, rolls his wrists and laps it to the fine leg fence. Knew the fiel{{BATSMAN}}r was squarer, so placed it beautifully\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a nothing length this. Too short. Sitting up nicely on the bat. And plundered back into the mid-wicket fence with a flat batted opened up pull\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dragged short and drifting down, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and helps it away through backward square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} opens his account with a boundary. A shortish ball that's picked early by the batsman. Gets into a good position and pulls it over square leg. Good shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a real sitter. Tries the surprise slower one dishing this one out at 117kph and just a tickle off the bottom of {{BATSMAN}}'s wood on the pull is enough to take it into the gap behind square and past the reach of the man running across\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rank long hop and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll. {{BOWLER}} knows it was a bad delivery and he's disappointed with himself. Pulled his length back, {{BATSMAN}} pivots back and muscles it in the gap - splitting deep mid-wicket and long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gee! {{BATSMAN}} is in some form. He goes down on his knees and slog sweeps it over deep mid-wicket with utmost ease for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, way too full from {{BOWLER}}, a half-volley really which {{BATSMAN}} pulverizes through the covers. That's too easy, something MI can ill afford\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, width on offer and {{BATSMAN}} pounces on it. Was short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reached for it and carved it over point. Third man is too fine to cut this down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, seems like {{BATSMAN}} read the bowler's mind here. Expected the short delivery, went deep in his crease and cleared his front leg to mow it over mid-wicket. Vijay Shankar in the dug-out enjoyed that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, to the other si{{BATSMAN}} of long-on this time. Was floated up fuller outsi{{BATSMAN}} off and {{BATSMAN}} whipped it away with that strong bottom hand of his. Power and precision in placement as he got it between long-on and {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drags it off the inside half, ahh, no wonder it's a batsman's game. {{BOWLER}} tries a slower cutter on the stumps, which {{BATSMAN}} makes room to and tries slicing over the covers -- but ends up with the edge on the inside pulling through an empty cow corner. Just a shot stands in between Hyderabad and a victory\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Helicoptered over mid-on. Brilliant from {{BATSMAN}}. It was nearly a yorker length from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} took his front leg out of the way and stayed deep. Lifted it excellently over mid-on. Even the inventor of the helicopter shot, MS Dhoni - who's at the other end - would've enjoyed that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh another freebie from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} cashes in with a sublime straight drive. Low full toss, misses the yorker and {{BATSMAN}} plants his front leg forward, drilling it ram-rod straight and shows his bat maker's name. Long-off and long-on fielders were mere spectators\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! Not the most ravishing innings but it has been a fighting knock from the Karnataka lad. And he looks like taking his team home. It was a short of length delivery on the face, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line of the ball and pulls it fine of fine leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, {{BOWLER}} - from round the wicket, slides this one onto {{BATSMAN}}'s hips, he gets inside the line, uses the angle and clips it behind square on the on-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a real smash-me outside off. Short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets on his tippy toes and flays it with brute power over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the switch-hit again and the backward point boundary is free. Bit of a top-edge from {{BATSMAN}}, but the ball escaped. He doesn't want to allow the bowler to settle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the short-ball attack isn't working and KXIP aren't learning either. Banged in short and down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line, swivels across and pulls it behind square on the on-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shortish delivery, not much width, {{BATSMAN}} punches it to sweeper cover off the back foot and freeze-frames his stance for a future batting manual\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 142.7km/h, length delivery angling into the pads, towards middle, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and closes the face at the last moment whilst on the backfoot to guide it away towards the deep square leg boundary for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drops the length short and allows {{BATSMAN}} to stand back and pull it away to deep square leg. Pivoted on his back leg to power the ball away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good length delivery outside off, hard length, {{BATSMAN}} runs his hands through a cover drive without any feet and caresses that with sweet timing to the sweeper cover boundary for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the way he had been caged, this was coming! Clears the front leg and swipes across the line, finding the gap through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wide full toss. {{BATSMAN}}, thankfully, holds his shape, quietly relying on placing it through the cover gap. And the gap's good enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time he gets a boundary! Shortish and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink, gets a fat outside edge that flies through the gap between backward point and short third man. There is no one to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! Full away swinger and draws {{BATSMAN}} into a drive away from the body, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard and the edge goes flying down to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oops. {{BOWLER}} and no-Chepauk is a turning into a nightmare. H continues to keep it short, and {{BATSMAN}} continues heaving them mercilessly into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} goes back to the shorter length, {{BATSMAN}} seems a tad comfortable with that, hops on one leg and uses {{BOWLER}}'s pace to guide it past the diving short fine leg fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, outside edge and third man is inside the ring, the ball flies over him as {{BATSMAN}} goes hard on the attempted lofted drive. Can he get a hundred? 14 to get, 4 more deliveries to go\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now a one-kneed stylish slog-whip over deep square leg. {{BOWLER}} fired it in and sees it flying round the corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! Angled across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} throws everything he's got at it, the outside edge flies away fine to the third man fence. The man was inside the ring and he had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's been smuggled past Ashwin at mid-on. Slower ball yeah, and {{BATSMAN}} clips it safely wide of Ashwin there. Knew the chase, as lethargic as it'll be, will be more for the cameras. And it was..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's timing and placement! \"That's class,\" calls Sunny G on air. Just a hint of width outside off on this back of a length dlivery and {{BATSMAN}} just taps it on the off-side. Pierces the gap between backward point and cover-point. The quick outfield does the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged away to the fence! Angled across the batsman outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat at it and gets an outside edge past Samson. Although the keeper dived, he couldn't quite reach there. Can't keep a slip either with just 10 balls to go\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, {{TEAM}} will take that! Doesn't matter how they come. Was a quicker delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} tried to slog it away but couldn't connect and Karthik failed to grab it too. That raced away to the fence in no time, so quick that was\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, incredible stroke! As if his conventional strokes aren't working enough, {{BATSMAN}} brings out the reverse sweep. Connects comfortably to clear short third man. Bleeding runs now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Right off the middle of the bat. {{BOWLER}} offers with outside off and {{BATSMAN}} smacks the drive through extra cover. Reached the fence like a bullet\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too much width and {{BATSMAN}} latches onto it. Bit of away-shape for {{BOWLER}}, but the length is on the shorter side. Too easy for any batsman. {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and slashes it through point. SKY and {{TEAM}} get off the mark\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, well this is no Chepauk .. Bhajji tries spinning one across from a leg-line, alas, it goes straight on for an easy flick right through square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the partnership between {{BATSMAN}} and Brendon McCullum is now 50+. A low, flat dipping full toss on middle and leg, and {{BATSMAN}} has hurried himself into a sweep round the corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he looks in fabulous touch, how quickly things can change for a batter in this format. It was a back of a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} hops a touch and half-pulls it wide of deep square leg for a boundary. Sweet timing!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now DK tries the reverse sweep and manages to get some bat on it. Off the inside part, misses the batsman's pad and beats the short third man fielder too. The asking rate is below 6\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a man at slip would have swallowed that. Outswinger outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} slashes hard, gets a thick edge and escapes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} looks disappointed as {{BATSMAN}} ends the over with a boundary. Makes room for himself and slices the length delivery over short third man. There were two fielders stationed there but both were inside the circle. Toying with the field is {{BATSMAN}} at the moment. Just 36 needed off 5 overs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's picking the spots so well. Was cramped for room, backed away and managed to loft it over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} who pumps it over mid-off. Really taking the bowling on, although the bowling is really ordinary at this stage\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, magnificent cover drive. When {{BATSMAN}} is on song, there are few better timers of the ball in India. This is overpitched and he leans forward to caress the drive wide of cover and extra cover. Threaded the needle there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, anything in his zone and {{BATSMAN}} is willing to take it on. The googly which is a bit full in length, {{BATSMAN}}'s back leg is in the air as he lofts it over {{BOWLER}}. Almost similar to the one he played in the last over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} has been too short today, drags his length down once again. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and pulls him past the square leg umpire\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and again. This time the slog-sweep. {{BATSMAN}} is playing a blinder now. Kneels down and nails this sweep, leaves deep square and deep mid as spectators\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, angles it into the left-hander. {{BATSMAN}} slogs across the line and hits it to deep mid-wicket. Didn't get it where he wanted, but had enough bat to fetch him a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pile on the misery. {{BOWLER}} slips, tumbles, falls down and then gets up to see the ball hitting the fence. A slip onto the hips and nurdled away fine enough. Mumbai well on course\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} finishes off in style, with a boundary. Picks the length early on the short one, rocks back and pulls it right into the gap at deep mid-wicket. No fielder there as {{TEAM}} end on a competetive score\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, freebie and {{BATSMAN}} accepts it gleefully. Short and sliding down leg, {{BATSMAN}} crouches low with a bent knee and sweeps it powerfully backward of square leg, split the two fielders there to collect his first boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely lofted drive and this should lift {{BATSMAN}}'s confidence. Straightaway looks to the heavens after connecting well. Full ball outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} hits this over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh {{BATSMAN}}! You bewdy! He was shaping up to scoop over the keeper, on seeing the yorker dip he stays still and slaps it off the face over short third, all wrists you know. He might have borrowed VVS' wrists. Seriously! Never seen someone scoring so many runs at ease with pure wristwork\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swept and swept fine, flighted delivery from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} took a big stride forward and powered that on his knees by rolling the wrists over the shot to keep it all along the ground through backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, anything pitched up and {{BATSMAN}} is not gonna let it go scot-free. Maintains solid base and crunches the loft over mid-off, {{BOWLER}}'s pace takes care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} bowls it slightly wide of off, but {{BATSMAN}} is well equipped to put that away. Bends his back leg, gets underneath the ball and tonks it over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss to begin with, {{BATSMAN}} creamed that nicely along the ground to cover, freebie to begin with from {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, highest score in this season! Cheeky from {{BATSMAN}}! Low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} picks it and laps it well wide of short fine and the ball dribbles away into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the newbie to IPL is welcomed in style by {{BATSMAN}}. It's short again and looking at the kind of touch {{BATSMAN}} is in he won't spare you. Pulls it nicely over mid-wicket, one bounce and into the fence she goes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played! {{BATSMAN}} is looking a million dollars today, tossed up well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} picked the length early, bent down low, rolled his wrists and swept it behind square on the on-side, beat the diving fielder in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, they are going for the shots now. Short ball, arrives lazily...gives {{BATSMAN}} ample time to pick his spot, he bludgeons the pull over mid-wicket with disdain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, on a good length and in that channel outside off, drew {{BATSMAN}} into the drive, he went with hard hands and gets a thick edge past the lone slip, rolls away to the fence in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot. Mid-off is up and {{BOWLER}} bowls a fuller length to compound things. Easy for {{BATSMAN}} though, he holds his shape and drives beautifully. Splits mid-off and extra cover easily to find the fence. Valuable runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's gawked at {{BOWLER}}'s release and read the slower delivery. Full too, so he's knelt and drilled that drive through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, class written all over it! It was on a good length and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} drives it like a boss, places it well and it runs along the carpet\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, got to feel for the bowler here? {{BATSMAN}} wants to play a premeditated scoop shot. It was the off-cutter and the ball bounced a tad more than the batter expected it to. Catches the top-edge and flies over the keeper's head for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, tad too short from {{BOWLER}}, allows {{BATSMAN}} to rock back and pull it wide of mid-wicket, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, foxing through everyone. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't read the wrong 'un, pulls all around it, and it's too good for Pant behind as well. Never mind the dive at the ropes, Harshal {{BATSMAN}}'s boot is touching. Just\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball that is too wide, makes things easy for {{BATSMAN}}. He stays back in the crease and thumps past the man at cover. Once he has got that out of the ring, it is always racing away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} joins in. It was only a matter of time. This is a top shot. Good length ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} drives on the rise and over Parthiv at the other end. He almost cleaned him up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, thank you so much says {{BATSMAN}}. Can't bowl there. On the pads, he gets his front leg away and bullies it behind square with sheer timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not too short, skidding through very close to the stumps, and that's chopped away off a crouch to the third man fence for four! That's through Dale Steyn at short third man, who's absolutely made a mess of this!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slaps the low full toss back at the bowler. {{BOWLER}} could not react in time to clasp that and the ball goes through his hands to race away to the long-off fence for a four. 44 off 18 balls is of academic interest. Or is it?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a helluva lot happened off this one ball. Now {{BATSMAN}} was shaping to scoop, and {{BOWLER}} nicely bowls the cutter wider of off-stump. {{BATSMAN}} adjusts though. Slices it, making the most of the room he had, but wasn't in control. Just cleared short third man's right-handed leap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, can't seem to string 6 good balls in an over. Overpitched and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out. Gets forward and strokes it wide of cover. Sweeper had no chance at all. Right off the middle of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smart cricket from {{BATSMAN}} Singh! Sits deep inside for the slower ball and steers it with the finest of touches at the last minute in the gap between the keeper and short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} might have had a wicket off the first ball this season. But the wicket-keeper and the slip fielder both are undecided. Nobody went for it. Length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} goes hard at it, outside edges that flies between the two men behind the stumps\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, murdered! That might get him going. Need a boundary off the middle and he's got it. Shimmies down and gets close to the flighted delivery then drills it straight down the ground, went at the rate of knots\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stays inside the crease this time, uncorks his wrists and flays the cut in the gap behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}! This was a flatter delivery on the pads and the southpaw flicks it past the fielder at short fine leg, nicely placed shot that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is superb batting from {{BATSMAN}}, attacking spin with positive strokeplay. Shuffles a bit early across the stumps and slog sweeps it cleanly over short fine leg. One bounce to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's brilliantly bowled, and {{BOWLER}} is so unlucky here. Having not given anything by way of flight all through the over, he tosses up a googly and dangles it wide of off to reap the pay-off for his pressure. {{BATSMAN}} bites, has an almighty swish at it but he is trying to drag the ball into the on-side against the turn, a ball which is very wide in the first place. The edge is found but it zooms over the man at slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, his famed cut. Those four dots were always leading into this, doesn't try and go too hard, waits for the room dished out outsi{{BATSMAN}} off get big and bisects mid-off and extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's that, then! {{TEAM}} live to fight another day, and as do KXIP, who need far too many results to go their way. An in-angler from round the wicket, and {{BATSMAN}} sways it away fine towards the long leg for four, to hand {{TEAM}} a second consecutive win!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now he is playing with the mind of {{BOWLER}}. It's a short ball, gives himself some room and slaps over cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the width on this delivery spelled it out for {{BATSMAN}}'s inside-out loft. He frees his arms to cream it wide of long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is spraying it all over the place. Misses the line and ends up offering a buffet ball for {{BATSMAN}} down leg. Just needed to get some bat on that. Does so after a half-swivel and runs it down to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he has bisected the gap between long on and cow corner to perfection! It was an offie on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} uses his bottom hand to good effect and whips it with the spin to the on-side for another boundary. He has started really well!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the spinner put under pressure right away by Jason. Picks the length early on this short delivery, camps back and hammers it past the fielder at wide long-on, no chance of the stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this guy is striking them at 264 and bits but doesn't play rash shots. That's the feature of his batting. Spots the field, fine leg is inside, so he allows the ball to come, the line was down the leg-side and he just helped it away fine past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! A fullish ball at 133.8kph, {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the pitch, converts it into a half-volley and drives it exquisitely straight of the mid-off fielder. With mid-off inside the circle, it wasn't a great idea to bowl full. {{BATSMAN}} took full toll of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no pace on this length delivery, but enough width to free the arms. Past backward point and the cut shot heads to the boundary. Second fifty in three games for young {{BATSMAN}}. The {{TEAM}} dugout is so happy for him. AB pats him on the helmet\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just wide of Ishan Kishan, but poor bowling from {{BOWLER}}, sliding down and easy for {{BATSMAN}} to get inside the line and help the ball with a faint tickle. Does enough to get it past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful batting. Down the pitch and to the flight of the ball, lofted clean over {{BOWLER}} and bisects the two men on the straight boundary. Brings the crowd back into life\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's another excellent shot. A inside out loft off the backfoot. This was fraction short and {{BATSMAN}} forced it over the cover fielder, he had enough power to beat the sweeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}}'s fast hands on display. Quicker and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stays leg-side of the ball and brings his hands down on the ball, lofted inside out over extra cover, one bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a half-tracker by {{BOWLER}} and it has spoiled the over for him. Was proving to be quite economical till then. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back in his crease and hammers the pull as it beats the sprinter at deep mid-wicket. Bowled well against Rana, but not so well against {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sliced away! No respect for the veteran spinner and the ball races away into the fence. Man at sweeper cover had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, to the left of third man. This is an edge. Tried to force that through backward point, the ball got big on him and he couldn't control it. But it raced away through the vacant gully region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, tossed up well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends down low, reverses his stance, uses the pace on the ball and laps it very fine, beats short third man and it's back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stand and deliver! No need to run for shots like that. Length ball that sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} stand tall and drill it wide of the bowler. No chance for mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ends up being a short on the legs of {{BATSMAN}}, who whips it from there. Through square leg and into the fence. Not quite timed but fetches him a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 14 runs off the first three balls. Pressure. Pressure! Once again {{BOWLER}} goes full with a pacy delivery, {{BATSMAN}} says thank you very much and smashes the leather off the ball, right over Markande and giving long-on no chance. Even Rohit could afford a clap with that boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Trademark {{BATSMAN}} shot. Seam-up delivery wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} manufactures more room by backing away. Lifts it inside-out over the cover region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's the front of the hand cutter kinda delivery. Slow off the deck and bouncing, and {{BATSMAN}} got a top-edge as he looked to swat it leg-side. Wide of the keeper and it runs away, deflecting off KL's helmet\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, dropped it short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} backed away, plays with the turn and cuts it over cover, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 85.6kph, {{BOWLER}} gives air on this occasion, but he's drifted it down leg. Easily put away by {{BATSMAN}}, who gets down on a knee and powerfully sweeps it backward of square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mowed from outside off and beats long-on to his right. Knelt down and hit it, not with great timing but good enough to get it in the gap and four more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, plenty of width, {{BATSMAN}} throws the bat and gets a thick edge which races away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, inside edge and that nearly shaved the leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} is very lucky that it missed the sticks. It was the indipper at 144kph, {{BATSMAN}} was chained to his crease and didn't expect it to come back into him. Had a late poke at it and the ball trims the inside edge and runs away to the fine leg fence. Remember, he was caught off an inside edge last year too - at this same venue\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he is hitting it really well. Again, moves away, creates room and clobbers it wide of long-off. Pollard ran to his left but fails to get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} flashes a wry smile. After conceding a boundary. Short into the body, but not that high to cause any trouble, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and pulls, beats deep backward square running to his left. So after the wicket maiden, 11 have come off the second over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, great effort in the deep but can only palm it away to the deep mid-wicket fence. Was a loose half tracker on leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} swivelled and pulled it flat. On the bounce past the diving fielder near the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully done - he's got a promotion and he's showing his class, leg-stump half-volley from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and flicks it over square leg, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of a good length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} nails the pull well in front of square on the leg-side. This is turning out to be an expensive over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor line from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} helps it down to fine leg and gets another boundary. Actually it was clever bowling from {{BOWLER}}, he saw {{BATSMAN}} race down and fired it down leg, but the southpaw outdid him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}}'s getting better with each passing delivery, he steps out, takes {{BOWLER}} on and lofts him inside-out over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is excellent batting! Not that bad a ball from {{BOWLER}}, on a good length around off stump but {{BATSMAN}} backs away early to make room. And then uses the pace to steer it between short third man and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he is toying around with the field! Makes room this time and although it's a hard length from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} biffs it over mid-on. Not a meaty connection but enough to clear the infield. What a gem of a knock this is turning out to be from the Kiwi in his first outing of the season\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short, wide, room, batsman cashes in. Opens the face of the blade and gets a four. Just used the pace of the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot! Once again the shuffle across aiding him. It is {{BOWLER}}'s favourite length but he offers width on this occasion, {{BATSMAN}} capitalizes and unleashes a powerful cut shot behind point, raced away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant start for the young {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}}. It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} uses his wrists to perfection and flicks it wide of mid-wicket for a boundary. Outfield is lighting quick!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this was out of the top draw. The slower delivery from {{BOWLER}}, on a short of length around middle and leg. Knuckle ball to be precise. {{BATSMAN}} picked it early, with a roundhouse and helped it over short fine leg. Easy-peasy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} not getting the googly right. Again down leg and this time {{BATSMAN}} gets a bit of bat/glove on that. The ball races away fine beating the short fine fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, angling wide across. {{BATSMAN}} in some form, he leans, frees up his hands, taking it head-on in hammering it square. Oh the way he opens up the face in slicing,check the leather!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, \"That is a stroke of a touch player,\" exclaims Ian Bishop on air. {{BATSMAN}} is a smart customer when it comes to manipulating the field in the PowerPlays. This was floaty away-angler from {{BOWLER}} outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets his weight forward and chips it over the in-field on the off-side. Bounces in front of the ropes and {{BATSMAN}} earns his second boundary of the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, wow! Missed stumping? What has happened to this game all of a sudden. Like a man on drugs. This ball opens {{BATSMAN}} up completely, rips off middle and squares up the batsman, leaves MS clueless too, drift in and spin away, past everyone including slip and races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} wanted the yorker, but instead offers a full delivery, {{BATSMAN}} lofts it straight back down the ground, no chance for the man at long-off to cut that off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fetch that! A length {{BATSMAN}}livery around middle and leg, the left han{{BATSMAN}}r stays put and whacks it over mid-wicket. Making the most of the powerplay by playing these aerial shots\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball, this time Yuvraj does not have time to react. The ball races away towards his right and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, rolls his wrists and helps it on its way, the man in the deep is square and the ball beats him to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sits up nicely in the slot. {{BATSMAN}} continues with his really high backlift, lofting a whack straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, fraction overpitched and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and drives it back past the bowler. AB dives but can't stop it, neither does the other diving fielder at mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, class written all over that shot. Seam-up delivery from a short of length. Width on offer as well. {{BATSMAN}} waits for the ball on the back foot and cuts it behind backward point. No chance for third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, carved away over extra-cover, and all of a sudden {{TEAM}} have the momentum. Full ball outside off, Faf somehow manages to get under it and lifts it over Williamson in the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, wry smile on {{BOWLER}}'s face, shortened his length and got it to hold its line, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to work it to the on-si{{BATSMAN}}, closed the bat-face, got a thick leading edge that raced away through the vacant slip cordon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes the round-armish way but dishes out it outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lunges across and lofts it over cover. Sort of played a short-arm jab there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, turn straightaway for {{BOWLER}} and he finds the outside edge. {{BATSMAN}} was on the front foot to defend, the turn took the thick outside edge of the bat and it flew past the man at slip. The Lions are off the mark\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped? Just fingertips I guess. Will go down as a missed opportunity. {{BATSMAN}} walks out of his crease and clubs it straight down the ground, it kept teasing long-on and long-off, in the end Shakib from long-on decided to go for it, but didn't judge it well and it looped over his left shoulder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gee this is going south. {{BOWLER}} has done nothing to allay fears. Bowls a full toss and is hammered down the ground. 19 off 5 needed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries, {{BOWLER}} dragged his length back a fraction, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to rock back and beats mid-wicket with the pull, pressure straightaway on {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, terrific shot to get off the mark! {{BOWLER}} shortens his length, no real pace to threaten the batsman. {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and pulls it backward of square leg. The man in the deep dives, but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} picks the googly and lifts it over extra cover. High percentage shot against spin. Waited for the ball to arrive, lunges forward and cashes in with a nonchalant loft. All grace from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ominous signs for KXIP because {{BATSMAN}} is timing them sweet and crisp. Not that full in length but he is well forward and punches it on the up. Beats the diving mid-off fielder and it's sped away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Iyer helps {{BATSMAN}} to get off the mark with a boundary. Full and drifting onto the pads, {{BATSMAN}} with the kind of form he's in, clips it through mid-wicket. Iyer did the hard work of getting to the ball, but slipped while gathering it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a rare blip from Shikhar Dhawan in the field, you won't see this often because he's usually a good fielder. A dipping low full toss on off, {{BATSMAN}} smashes it down to long-off, Dhawan was pretty squarer and had to run across to his right. Did so and in the process, sort of took his eyes off the ball. Or got an awkward bounce too, failed to get his body behind the line of the ball and lets it through to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is keeping Mumbai alive in this chase. He's {{BATSMAN}}aling in boundaries and absorbing all the pressure. A short {{BATSMAN}}livery around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and puts it away to the fine leg fence, the fiel{{BATSMAN}}r was too square to cut this down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full, too full and biffed! Murdered down the ground past the bowler for a four. The man at mid-off had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, nothing is going right for RCB at the moment. Sloppy from Nath. Full and swerved in a little, {{BATSMAN}} failed to connect on the big heave and Nath makes a mess of it behind. Very lazy stuff, was late to bend down and misses it altogether\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky but four, tossed up slower and spinning away from outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was making room on the inside out drive, doesn't cover for the spin and slices it over backward point, couple of bounces and over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, thick outsi{{BATSMAN}} edge and four. Wi{{BATSMAN}} full {{BATSMAN}}livery outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}}'s edge flies over short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery this and {{BOWLER}} is made to pay. Sprays it down leg and that is easy pickings for any batsman, {{BATSMAN}} stays inside the line and whips it fine. No chance for Dinda this time around\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a one-handed hoick. Saw the line (drifting down leg) and swiped it as hard as he can, no-one there at fine leg. Great placement\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misfield allows a boundary! {{BOWLER}} can't even complain because it's his skipper who is the culprit at mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} thumped the drive really well and Iyer wanted to attack the ball to have a shy at the bowler's end. Eventually missed it completely\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, played the slower ball at 93ks brilliantly here. Waits and pulls, splitting the two fielders in deep square on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swept and swept fine, flighted delivery from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} took a big stride forward and powered that on his knees by rolling the wrists over the shot to keep it all along the ground through backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, strays it wide outside off with the angle going across, {{BATSMAN}} slaps it through point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superb from {{BATSMAN}}. Doesn't overhit this short ball, just waited for it and lifted his one leg to unleash a short-arm pull past the fielder at short fine leg. Bread and butter for him.. too leg-sidish from {{BOWLER}}, needs to shift his line to outside off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 131.6kph, continues dishing out full pace and {{BATSMAN}} obliges with the elegant-est of cover drives, on the up,through both the dives of extra cover and mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, positive stroke! He doesn't want the spinner to settle in here. Gives the charge by coming down the track, wasn't anyhwere close to the pitch of the ball, but with a big swing of the bat he smashed it over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stylish shot to get off the mark! A tad too straight in line, full as well and {{BATSMAN}} wrists it away past the diving forward square leg fielder. Timed it sweetly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow. That's been driven on the up and over mid-on. Powerfully struck from {{BATSMAN}}. Maybe he's decided that's the way he wants to go today\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for this. Half-volley begging to be smashed and {{BATSMAN}} accepts it with glee. Planting his front foot across and belts it through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one-handed check drive from {{BATSMAN}}, aerial as well but then, the intention was to clear the infield. Therefore, the deception didn't of the slower ball didn't dent his intent and he went through with the chip shot. Over extra cover and to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, takes it from the sticks and gets it between short fine and square leg for a four. More off the inner half of the bat but that was enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tries to bowl very full and wide from round the wicket but {{BATSMAN}}'s reached out to it. Throws his hands, slices it away, and it's been hit with power. Skittles away, beating Sandeep's dive. Scores level\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, this is poor bowling from {{BOWLER}}, might not go against him, but it's still a boundary against the team. Too full and on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he was looking to flick and missed, brushed the pads and beat the diving keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} toys with {{BOWLER}}. Plants his front leg across the stumps and hoicks it behind square. Maintained a low base to get underneath the ball and that was the key\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sits on the back foot this time, expects the length to be short and swivels into his pull in a flash. Placed it in the gap behind square and that's {{BATSMAN}}'s first boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, expensive over so far... Floated around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} picks it over square leg and adds four more to his tally. That's the only way he plays\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he has whipped it away magnificently well. Gee! This man can bat. {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker, it ends up being in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} and he uses his wrists to smash it wide of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} wants to have some fun, length delivery outside off, he gets forward and thumps it over extra-cover for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, chants of '{{TEAM}}, {{TEAM}}' as soon as {{BATSMAN}} thumps this one down the ground. Reaches out for the tossed up delivery and lofts it straight over the bowler's head for a clean boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bullied through extra cover. The intentions are clear from {{BATSMAN}}. Knuckle ball, on a fuller length outside off. {{BATSMAN}} sets a solid base and crunches it wide of long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fired in from round the wicket once again, angling towards leg-stump, Maxi plants his front leg across and slugs a pseudo-pull off a low stance towards fine leg for four. Used the pace and angle, didn't need much power\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length delivery angling towards off and middle, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across to get off-side of the ball and tickles it away to fine leg for four. Uses the pace extremely well, does {{BATSMAN}}. Not something he's known for, but there he is proving everyone wrong and playing the finesse game\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just a slice of inside edge and through. It skids straight on and nicks the edge before racing past the leg-stump. Tough for Robbie to pick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, \"that's a terrible misfield,\" reckons Slater on air. {{BATSMAN}} slogs the length ball towards deep mid-wicket where Samad charges in, takes his eyes off the ball as he tries to grab the ball, and makes complete mess of it..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft, innovative, just {{BATSMAN}} things..goes across his sticks and scoops the pacer over short fine's head for a four. This man is a killer of bowling plans. The field is bound to change\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just a trifle short that and {{BATSMAN}} swivels with the incoming angle. Blasts it one-legged in front of the square leg umpire\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} easily glances it past short fine leg, Ishan Kishan runs to his left in the deep and dives but the ball wins the race\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, everything going {{TEAM}}'s way. A genuine outside edge and it has flown to the third man fence. Flashed at a length delivery outside off and got a thick edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft touch! On the pads and {{BATSMAN}} clips it past the fielder at short fine leg. The fielder in the deep was very square in order to cut this down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, thick top-edge on the pull from {{BATSMAN}}, loops over the keeper's head and bounces once before crossing the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the slot and disappears over the bowler's head. The cameras pan on Miller, who has a clueless expression on his face. Poor delivery it was and {{BATSMAN}} muscled it down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky! Smart batting by {{BATSMAN}}. He knows that {{BOWLER}} is firing 'em in and he uses that to his advantage, walks across his stumps and laps it over the keeper, the pace takes care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time he cuts along the ground, the length wasn't all that shorter compared to the previous ball, {{BATSMAN}} timed that shot sweetly as well and pierced the gap between cover-point and cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, terrific placement! Fine leg and deep mid-wicket are the fielders on the leg-side boundary, so KW decides to ping that gap. Shuffles across early and gets inside the line to pull this short delivery that didn't rise as much to trouble {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good improvisation there from {{BATSMAN}}. Mumbai needed a boundary to make it a good over. He moves inside the line, gets under the back of a length delivery and helps it over short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a way to get to yout fifty! Second half-century this season. He cuts the shortish ball outside off and pierces the gap between backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary for {{TEAM}} and {{BATSMAN}}! Another googly by {{BOWLER}}, the southpaw rocks back and places it right through the gap at covers with a firm backfoot punch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rank long hop, {{BATSMAN}} says thank you. Short, down leg, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and nails the pull behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Too short, {{BATSMAN}} stays back and cuts it square of the wicket. Powerfully hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a way to greet a new bowler. Looped up delivery, but in the process overpitched, {{BATSMAN}} presses forward and chipped it inside-out over extra cover. Top shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a quality hit from {{BATSMAN}} but hang on, why on earth did you bowl normal pace {{BOWLER}}? Full and wide outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} drills the drive over cover and there's no one in the deep. Great start to the over for DD\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slaps it over the off-side ring. No need to run for those when you keep striking them like that. This is simply brilliant batting from the duo\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a shot! He's been playing breathtaking strokes for fun tonight. Here is another of those. Fullish length and {{BATSMAN}} sits in the crease before and blasts it down the ground towards long-off. No chance for the fielder there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant shot! Straight drive down the ground. Back past the bowler and it was a four. Was full and {{BATSMAN}} nailed it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, unlucky! {{BATSMAN}} is hurried by the short delivery, but at this stage of the innings the batsmen tend to throw their bat at everything, the top edge flies over short fine and lands just in front of the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, typical {{BATSMAN}}. Down on his knee in a flash as he picks the floated delivery to perfection. Enough elevation behind this scoop-like shot, with a lot more power behind. Almost went the distance at fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he has all range of strokes in his kitty. Brings in the reverse sweep into play and gets it over the point fence on a couple of bounces\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is not learning. Sprays another full ball and it ends up as a half-volley again. Drilled fluently square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track and then plays his favorite lofted hit. Over a leaping extra cover. Just managed to clear the man and that will be good in the powerplay\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more. {{BATSMAN}} starting to really find his timing now and he's looking dangerous. This is smart batting rather than just throwing his bat at everything. He knows that fine leg is up and so he waits for the back of a length delivery to come to him before pulling it over the fielder. {{BOWLER}} under pressure\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cross-seamer, fuller and wider of off, KP manages enough contact on the rash drive and the edge flies wide of the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short enough and wide enough, slapped away for four through backward point. {{TEAM}} regaining momentum through these two again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another ugly across-the-line swipe. And Uthappa's luck rubs into {{BATSMAN}}, who goes hard, gets a thick top-edge, flying over slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first ball and he's away. We've seen that before from {{BATSMAN}} this season. Isn't shy to take the bowler on, even as early as his first ball. Picks length quickly, and swats it through mid-wicket off the front foot. Dismissive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, expertly played! The off-cutter on a shortish length and moreover {{BATSMAN}} had the width, he back cuts it behind point and Narine never looked like getting to the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not too smart bowling from {{BOWLER}}. Drifting onto {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, too easy for Faf as he just gets inside the line and tucks it past square leg. The timing is good enough to fetch him a four there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and cuts it square past point. Sran has a lot of distance to cover, he slides and pulls the ball back in. The third umpire has several looks and reckons that his boot was touching the ropes as he pushed it back into play, given as a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, greets {{BOWLER}} with a whippy flick. Flatter and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} brings his bat down at an angle and whips it past mid-on. No chance for the deep mid-wicket fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 141.5kph. Another juicy overcook. {{BATSMAN}} has a big stride to it, making the half volley all the more fuller and holds all his shape to drill it through the covers. There may be three men there, but he's still finding the angles perfectly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, repeats the gait of the previous ball and gets an outside edge to run it down towards third man. He got wood on it and got it fine after just using the pace of the bowler. 15 off the over!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, completely duped. Totally. {{BATSMAN}} was looking to shimmy out but slipped, and to make things worse, {{BOWLER}} drops it slightly wider. {{BATSMAN}} has to reach out and trims an inside edge past the leg-stump. Four. All that and four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, leg cutter and {{BATSMAN}}'s smashed him off the front foot. Shortish, decking away, and hammered through mid-wicket with utter disadain. Another day at work, another fifty for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bad ball and rightly put away by {{BATSMAN}}. A drag down by {{BOWLER}} and the line is down leg, {{BATSMAN}} moves off-side, gets low and helps it on its way with a pull over short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} Sharma! Full and plenty of width outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lashes on it with a crunchy drive through extra cover, superbly timed!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, treating {{BOWLER}} with utter disdain. That's dismissive. Good length ball, {{BATSMAN}} muscles it with a lot of bottom hand over mid-on. Nearly carried all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, freebie and {{BATSMAN}} won't miss out. He's a man in form. Kohli would not want his bowlers to bowl such balls. On the pads, easy glance to the fine leg fence. First boundary for the hosts\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swinging like the pendulum of a clock already, this innings. Back of a length delivery outside off, width on offer and {{BATSMAN}} has thumped it through cover-point with authority. No need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another slower one, and {{BATSMAN}} waits again to let it reach, carting it over the on-side for four! {{BATSMAN}} on fire!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the PP show rolls on! Short ball and the batsman trampled back to smack the pull away towards the deep mid-wicket region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, through the gates! That won't please the bowler, nor the captain. A fullish ball on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it superbly, but was straight to the man at mid-wicket. Karn Sharma there allows it to go through his legs. First boundary in IPL for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky! {{TEAM}} need a kick on and who better than their skipper. {{BATSMAN}} waits for the leg-break and he opens the bat face at the last second, the ball races past the diving short third man fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball angling across, {{BATSMAN}} cuts from underneath it and gets it over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short delivery and the batsman is quick to latch on it. The short deliveries were getting predictable and the batsman rocked back to slaughter that. The man in the deep - Tye, dives but fails to pull it back\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Lovely drive, {{BOWLER}} bowls a full ball, didn't swing, {{BATSMAN}} leant into the drive and placed it to the right of mid-on. Moves into the 20s\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} absolutely nails this! Spoils what was turning out to be a good over. Brings up 4000 IPL runs for himself as well. Back of length at the stumps, he opens himself up and swings into a brutal cross-batted smite through square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slightly short, doesn't exactly rise, but width on offer - chopped off the attempted cut, over backward point and away to the boundary where Umesh Yadav dives in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, throws his bat at a wide delivery and gets four. Thick edge and it races away past the cordon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky! Normal pace delivery from {{BOWLER}} but he's offered space outside off, {{BATSMAN}} allows the ball to arrive and runs it away fine to third man. The ball raced away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, squeezes out a wide yorker past backward point. That's superbly done from {{BATSMAN}} Patel, first to reach out and then to guide it with an open bat-face\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, airy drive but in the gap at mid-off. Pitched fuller just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was through his drive early and it pings him slightly high on the bat. Hence, it went in the air and beats Ashwin\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely batting from {{BATSMAN}}. It was the slower delivery and he didn't try to overhit it, saw mid-off inside the circle and delayed his loft for a second, struck it cleanly and got a one bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, squeezes it through the ring. Full and wide ball, {{BATSMAN}} plants his foot across and unfurls a drive through the covers. It didn't look like he get all of the timing, but on this outfield it's enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another short of length delivery, it was at comfortable hip-height for {{BATSMAN}} who gets in a good position and dispatches it wide of deep square leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another googly taken apart. {{BATSMAN}} is reading them perfectly, going really deep to this one and then timing his cut really well behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the airrrr, oh he's misjudged the catch. Rashid Khan, a fine fielder, the culprit there. But {{BATSMAN}} deserves this bit of luck. Fifty on debut. What a start. Can't imagine Kohli's emotions right now. He would be really excited. Flighted delivery on the stumps, the slog-sweep behind square, Rashid attacked the bat as it was hit flat, but he realised it was going over, so put the brakes and tried to go back but slipped and the outstretched arm wasn't long enough. Kohli stands and applauds as {{BATSMAN}} raises the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crashed away by {{BATSMAN}}! Got a bit of width on this turning off break, the length allowed him to wait and he slapped it through cover-point. Sweeper is behind square on the off-side and had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! That was bowled at 143kph. Short of a good length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of it and caresses it between mid-off and extra cover. No need to run for shots like that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 141ks short ball slanting in wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and nails the pull over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, whipped away. Poor ball on leg-stump and {{BATSMAN}} times his flick beautifully through mid-wicket. It was hit uppishly but he found the gap pretty well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful! Pitches it on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} makes sure to send it to the long-on fence with a fine on-drive, {{TEAM}}... {{TEAM}}... are the chants all across the stadium\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and again. Such a deft touch. Normal pace from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} utilizes all of it and steers it cheekily. Karthik dives, third man dives, but to no avail\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he attempted that off the first ball and missed. Not now. Uses the pace of {{BOWLER}} to great effect. Steers late and with an open face, right off the middle of the bat and Uthappa running around from third man can only watch it run away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sliced away nicely! {{BATSMAN}} has been backing away to the shorter length ball and does it again. This time he gets a fair chunk of the outer half and flies well wide of the third man fielder to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slightly off-line and four. Can't err in any way to {{BATSMAN}}. Low full-toss and swung to the left of long-on, one bounce over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}}'s off the mark with a boundary! A gentle short delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} waits on the back foot and pummels it over mid-wicket with brute power\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, they're looking to attack {{BOWLER}}, too short and too straight from the leg-spinner, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and pulls it behind square on the on-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky from {{BATSMAN}}. Walks inside the line of the ball and scoops it over short fine leg for his second boundary of the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the boundaries have started to flow. A good length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} moves away and carves it over point. No chance for the fielder at third man to cut this down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's only dealing in boundaries. {{BOWLER}} tried the change of pace to fox the batsman, but it went too full and landed right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} to drive, credit to {{BATSMAN}} for delaying the shot to get the timing right and hit it well wide of the man at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} rolled his wrists on the cut and got it down, beats extra cover and gets another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 100-run stand comes up between the duo. Cross-seamer from {{BOWLER}}, but it's too full outside off. Can't bowl there with mid-off in the circle. {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and drills it over the fielder's head beautifully\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beats square leg this time. This was dragged down short on leg stump and {{BATSMAN}} had ample time as he rocked back for the pull. Didn't time it all that well, but well enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length delivery on the stump, 115.9km/h, {{BATSMAN}} clears that leg and clubs it off the toe-end just over mid-on to the long-on fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} ingeniously slices it away over backward point. Shades of the shot Dhoni played the other night, but not quite as good. He just about clears Harbhajan though. {{BOWLER}} must be crestfallen, this was a perfectly good ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, consecutive boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}. Once again the length is wrong - on the shorter side, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and slaps the cut in front of square, no chance for Sran coming across from sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball, {{BATSMAN}} waits till eternity and upper steers the ball over short third man for a four. 10 off the first two balls. Pressure back on RCB and {{BOWLER}} as Kohli tries to egg his bowler on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, these are all useful runs to reduce the margin of defeat. Surely they can't win this can they? {{BOWLER}} misses his yorker by a couple of inches and is sliced away over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, timely boundary for {{BATSMAN}} who has been looking to make a move on for some time now. Shortish and angling into him, was pulled away hard in front of square through the leg-side. ABD in the deep got across but probably timed the slide wrong. Ends up palming it past the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no-one's preventing this one. Halftracker outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} transfers his weight onto the back foot and hammers it powerfully wide of extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the top-edge goes over the keeper's head and runs away for another boundary. No luck lor {{BOWLER}}, who banged one short and the bal got big on the batsman. {{BATSMAN}}, despite not being in a good position, went with the pull shot. He will be happy with the result though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flies over a leaping short fine leg! 'Catch it!' was the call but the fielder had no chance at all. Another rubbish ball from {{BOWLER}}, short on leg stump and {{BATSMAN}} just helps it on its way with the pull shot. Just used the pace and picked his spot to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, juicy half tracker. {{BATSMAN}} waits, waits some more. And some more. Loads up a pull, with all the muscle to swat it away through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, well played! This was a tossed up delivery, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the wicket and smokes it right over the bowler's head. Straight as an arrow, on a bounce and over the fence. Hit the cushions in fact\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this was not the area {{BATSMAN}} was targeting. He was looking to go over extra cover, but the bat turned on impact and the length delivery was sliced over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overcorrects and floats one up under DK's eyes, he thumps the drive through extra cover, wowza! What bat speed..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball and {{BATSMAN}} latches onto it! No pace behind that delivery to trouble. He waits this slower delivery to come to him and pulls it away wide of the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the ball hits the turf and zips off. McCullum had a few yards to cover and he couldn't get there. Very full and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lofts it wide of long-off, one bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, backs away and drives! That was again uppish, but the dive from the man at cover was never in contention to take that. It was close though!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, woah! All timing from {{BATSMAN}}. Very cheeky, saw the width provided, so just waited deep and steered it behind point. This outfield is pretty quick and third man can't cut it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, doesn't matter where the field is when you're bowling full tosses. {{BATSMAN}} stands deep in his crease, swinging with a lot of bottom-hand to whack it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short, wide and four, {{BATSMAN}} gets going after some luck, short and wide of off, he gets on top of the bounce, used Sran's pace and cracked it square behind point. Third man has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classy from {{BATSMAN}}. Displaying pure elegance. Half-volley from {{BOWLER}} at 149.4kph, immense bat-speed from {{BATSMAN}} as he props forward and times the drive sublimely through extra cover. Just rocketed away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower version of {{BOWLER}}'s slower ball but gets the line wrong. Loads of width and {{BATSMAN}} works it in his favour by going deep and cuts it fiercely past point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and he shows us here that it is not all brawn about him. There is a smart brain to go with it as well. This is down leg and with short fine inside the ring, he whips it over the man's head. 19 off the over and {{BATSMAN}} is turning it on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how well has he timed that? This is the second time the ball has gone past a diving AB de Villiers. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} plays a back foot drive, plays it to the left of cover and it escaped across the turf. This is a fast start from Mumbai, despite a first-ball wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, fraction too short and drifting onto {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he waits on it and then works it behind square on the on-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} darting them in real quick - 95kph this one. {{BATSMAN}} goes back, uses the pace of it and tickles it nice and fine. Bit too straight this one from round the wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes for the slog, the ball chalks the inner meatier part of the bat and that is enough to send it away from the diving long-on fielder. BMac gave it a valiant chase and dived full stretched to his left but the ball landed away from him and went over the fence. That four has helped things for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundaries flowing from both ends now! {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in his crease and bludgeons the length delivery past the man at long-on. Good connection there!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short. And that fiendly short. {{BATSMAN}} jumps, doesn't mind pulling it with an air-swivel, powerfully through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! Pacy length ball wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} looks to drive with hard hands and gets a fat outside edge. Runs well past the keeper's reach and races away into the third man fence. Tahir puts a desperate dive, but can't stop it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Perhaps, a safe shot. Stands tall, waits for the ball to come to him and launches this short of a good length delivery over mid-off. One bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} gets too straight and too full again and he's been whipped away. {{BATSMAN}} not missing out on any freebies he gets. Beats short fine leg to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time he cuts well and gets it in the gap between cover-point and backward point. The length was just short enough for {{BATSMAN}} to rock back and execute the shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is beautifully done from {{BATSMAN}}. So deft. Perfectly good delivery from {{BOWLER}}, turning in from a length towards off. {{BATSMAN}}'s intentions are highly concealed all the way through, but just when the ball is about to pass him, he lays the softest of touches to deflect it past the keeper's glove into the third man boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this one surely hit the sweet spot. And it has reached the fence like a tracer-bullet! It was a slower one on a fuller length, {{BATSMAN}} delays his bat swing and powers it wide of long-off for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third successive delivery straying on the pads, the length was short, so it won't swing, {{BATSMAN}} pulls, can't tell he controlled that but he placed it well wide of the man at square leg/widish mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's nobody in the deep on the off-side, but {{BOWLER}} for some reason still wants to bowl a half-tracker with lots of width. {{BATSMAN}} won't complain, slicing it over cover, which is all he had to do\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, width on offer from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} threw his bat at that, gets a healthy edge that flies through the vacant second slip region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, poor line and length from {{BOWLER}}, length ball on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he was looking to flick and missed, struck his pads and ran away fine, beat the keeper and rolled away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and Mishy continues to struggle against the right-hander, very strange through. He is so unwilling to toss the ball up and has hardly made {{BATSMAN}} play off the front foot. It's a short delivery that turns away, {{BATSMAN}} cuts well through point and beats the sweeper's dive on the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and again.. Bhuvi does not look at his best in the death. Taken to the cleaners by Russell in the previous game and now {{BATSMAN}} getting stuck into him. Missed the yorker and the squeezed drive beat Pathan near backward point and raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hard slog across the line. Doesn't pick it cleanly, dragging it in the end only off the inside half of his bat .. the powerplay and Southee's chasing dive can't stop it from trickling into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 16 off first 3 balls. {{BATSMAN}} is on fire. Protracts his hands to this widish ball and cleverly guides it past short third man. Kotla breaks the sound barrier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, awkwardly for Warner and he can't stop it. A high full toss, swung away by {{BATSMAN}}, bounces just in front of his body and he can't even get a hand on that. Slips away from his grasp\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's hit uppishly and Manish Pan{{BATSMAN}}y at long-off tries his best diving to his left but it elu{{BATSMAN}}s him. Floater outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} plants his front foot across and lofts it towards long-off and luckily gets away as Manish's outstretched lefthand was far enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} are almost there! The captain for the night is producing a knock for the ages. Shortish one on leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} just swivels across and helps it well wide of short fine leg. Just a hit away now!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and effective. Uses the slightest of widths outside off and opens his bat face to guide it wide of the keeper into the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short, no width, {{BATSMAN}} arches back into a semi-limbo and scythes that away to the deep backward point fence for four. Expertly done\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top stuff. {{BOWLER}} gets just that little fuller-than-good, and {{BATSMAN}} goes inside-out, without a lot of feet movement either, lofting it wide of long-off comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 140kph .. and {{BATSMAN}} flashes hard. Full, wide and a thick outside edge on {{BATSMAN}}'s slap, but there's no slip, and third man's rather square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 3 off 3 now! What a shot! Dhoni-esque. Dances down the track and elegantly flicks it through mid-wicket after converting it into a full toss. Wristily played and it raced away off the bat. Jaddu gives up in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 131.5kph, wide high full toss, full paced. {{BATSMAN}} flays, gets it past cover's dive. Well, it doesn't get easier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's somehow glanced this yorker into the fine leg boundary. Really well done from {{BATSMAN}}. The line - which was on leg-stump - helped his cause\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the sweet sweeps. More of them. Gets one right in the slot and the premeditation does the rest. Brooms it in front of square..and well past the hopes of those perched out there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, massive space for sale beyond mid-wicket and {{BATSMAN}}, who is not afraid to walk across the stumps, meets this length ball with a flick to the right of mid-wicket and greets {{BOWLER}} with a boundary first up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, There's the trademark switch-hit from {{BATSMAN}}. Flighted full just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} changes his stance and lifts it over short third man. He was itching to play this shot for a while, does so now..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, woah! That is smoked to the fence. Good length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} brings that high backlift into play and crunches the square drive past cover-point, no one moved in the off-side ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} needs to miss backward point and the sweeper, does so easily, launches it in the air and well wide of both the men, races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hit-me delivery and {{BATSMAN}} does not miss out. Slow, short and down leg, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and helps it along the way to fine leg. Mishra was square and well in front of the rope, he had no chance of stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just a fraction short, a tad outside off, {{BATSMAN}} pokes it with an angled bat away to the third man fence for four. Races away...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, an action replay of the previous delivery. {{BOWLER}} just stares in despair. At DK who has flicked him again over mid-wicket. Sheer timing and nearly went all the way, one bounce over the ropes. What form he is in at the moment\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a shot. {{BOWLER}} drags it short, {{BATSMAN}} is extremely quick to read the length. Pivots back and hammers it through mid-wicket. Stuart Binny from the deep sprints across and dives, but ends up parrying it to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clobbered, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track, that allows him to free his arms and deposits it back past the bowler, beat mid-on to his right and races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, pushed through flatter and quicker, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles down the track, makes room as he did so and drives it wide of mid-off, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sloppy! Binny has just gifted three runs. Nothing but a nudge to long-on and he came racing in to stop the second, the batsmen were never going to take it, overruns the ball and allows it to trickle into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, way too full. {{BATSMAN}} opens up his bat face, laying into the width to slice it away through point. That's more the Chris ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and wide, no feet to go towards it, just gets under it and lifts it away towards long-off for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, creamed, but that was poor fielding from Tahir, went down in a heap and ended up diving over the ball. On a good length and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans into the drive and finds the gap past cover. Tahir ran to his right and made a big mess of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He is the key for {{TEAM}} if they have to get a good total. Has played himself in and now has the hang of the surface. Waits for the slower delivery, shuffles across and pulls it backward of square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, defensively wide. {{BATSMAN}} smart enough, stays back, stretches and carves it away through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, chance and dropped - and it's by RJ of all people - length ball outside off and {{BATSMAN}} swiped it over square leg. RJ ran across to his left, got there with plenty of time, got both hands and then let the ball burst through - to add insult to injury, it dribbled over the ropes\n",
            "Nav{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped. CDG is the culprit and it should've been taken. A straightforward chance but the Kiwi all-roun{{BATSMAN}}r fails to cling onto it. Whacked hard and towards mid-wicket, I reckon CDG mistimed his jump and it bursted through his fingers. You cannot drop a form batsman like {{BATSMAN}} and this will hurt RCB\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, is it {{BATSMAN}}' night? Looking at the way he's played so far, definitely looks like. This was a flat delivery and full in length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went for the reverse sweep and got it right past the fielder at short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 16 off {{BOWLER}}'s first over in IPL 2017. He errs in line drifting down leg, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and helps it away behind square on the leg-side. The ball races away into the fence. {{TEAM}} are off to a flier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the gap is found. {{BOWLER}} shortens his length and serves a bit of width, {{BATSMAN}} stays back in his crease and cuts it to pierce the gap between short third man and backward point. Superb placement\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, steered! Four! past short third man that one. Fuller and wider one, {{BATSMAN}} maintained his balance to squeeze it past short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, down leg, swept fine and that will run away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that was a chocolate brownie of a delivery and the batsman puts the icing on it with the help of an eyes-scream of a shot. Cut away easily past the man at point making the man at third man look like a statue\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, you don't often see a batsman play sweep shot to a fast bowler. Let's call this {{BATSMAN}} special. Buries on one knee and sweeps it fiercely behind square. Races away to the fence in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, width on offer from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes lit up, threw the kitchen sink at that, gets a thick edge that races away through the vacant slip cordon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, uses the pace of {{BOWLER}} and collects a boundary. Pushed through just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waits and steers it fine. Once past the 30-yard circle, there's no stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, drifts one on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} fails to put bat on the tickle. The ball brushes the thigh pad and beats the diving keeper to run away to fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, up and over! {{BATSMAN}} is away and so are the Royals. It was on a fuller length and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} plunges forward and lofts it over cover. He gets enough bat on it to clear the in-field and once it lands, it races towards the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's getting into the act straightaway. Perhaps a slower ball again from {{BOWLER}}, this is fuller though and {{BATSMAN}} waits for it, before dispatching it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh Chahar! Dhoni won't be happy with that effort. Short of a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} pullls through mid-wicket, what should have been maximum two is now four because Chahar didn't bend enough. The eternal fast bowler's problem! I know!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done! Risky, but executed it so well. With a slip in place, {{BATSMAN}} employs the late-dab. Played very late and got it wide of the slip fielder. No third man to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, spoils a good over by smearing the ball into the wide long-off boundary. To be fair, {{BOWLER}} was asking for it by bowling this gentle full toss outside off. Duly punished\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} will remain positive, {{BATSMAN}} brings out the reverse sweep with a slip in place, doesn't get hold of the shot, but has enough to get it past the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets as low as possible and scoops the full ball to the left of the keeper, timed it well and the pace on the ball took care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball and {{BATSMAN}} punishes it! Sprayed on the pads, fuller as well and he just had to pick his spot. Watches it onto the bat and glances it very fine, beating short fine leg with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lucky edge. {{BATSMAN}} charges down to open up a cut over the off-side, but the bounce gets big on him, and the outside splice is good enough to fly over the slip cordon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, on a good length and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans into the drive, plays it on the up and finds the gap to the left of cover - no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor cricket from Boult - he was never going to get to the ball, not with the angle he was running into - dived forward and then let the ball go past him, concedes a boundary. The slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, rolled away fingers across the seam, {{BATSMAN}} picked it and then swung it behind square on the on-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} and {{BATSMAN}} are bossing this chase now! KW has played his cards wrong tonight. Length ball on the pads and has been whipped away past the short fine leg fielder for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets across and picks {{BOWLER}} off his pads over fine leg, clean swing of the bat and timed it to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not a bad shot to get off the mark. Moves across to this short ball and helps the pull to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, keeps the pull down, staying up on the bounce that doesn't get big and nailing it through square leg. Again, just a drop, one tiny drop ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now shows his power. {{BOWLER}} offers him the space to free his arms and {{BATSMAN}} thumps it straight back over Tye, no chance for long-on to get across and stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} knows he's going to bowl short, it's down the leg side and he helps himself to a boundary with a pull shot behind square on the on-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, messy. {{BOWLER}} is fuming as Samson fumbles behind. Can't blame him much because he got an iffy bounce. Off-pace delivery, snaked away sharply outside off. The keeper couldn't get his body behind the line and it runs away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} adds four to his tally. That was clipped away and the slide from the man at deep mid is not good enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is a thick edge but it will do for {{BATSMAN}}. Backs away and slashes the short of length {{BATSMAN}}livery, gets enough bat on that to clear backward point and short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another amazing shot by {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} with the double-teapot pose, wondering what he has done wrong. {{BATSMAN}} down the track, in a flash and even when there's no room on the back of a length delivery, whiplashes the slash, gets it through cover and extra-cover. Right into the gap. Top batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a shocker from Kuldeep and he concedes four runs. This was dropped short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} backed away and cut it straight to backward point. Kuldeep dived over the ball and ends up conceding a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, draws the edge. But this is no England, this is not 2014 - so this will be a boundary. {{BATSMAN}}'s squared up with the angle going across him on off, jabs his bat out, outside-edging it past the lone slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 142ks sits up nicely outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, AB thrashes it with a cross bat swing past the diving left hand of mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh the cheek. The deft. Attempts the scoop and nails it. Off the middle of the blade, nothing streaky about this one as he guides it past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cross-seam delivery, width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and stabs it through covers. The fielders on the off-side ring stay unmoved\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's one of his trademark shots. Saw the full middle stump delivery and then went inside out over cover. No chance for Polly at long-off. Gets forward and then gives himself room to get the elevation\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, my colleague Kumar who dines and drinks on stats tells me this - {{BOWLER}} now has the most expensive figures this IPL. Not a proud record if you are the youngster. Good shot, full delivery on off, {{BATSMAN}} opened the bat face and that's why he could find the gap with the square-drive wide of the fielder in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, adventure from {{BATSMAN}}. Deals another flatter ball by bringing out the reverse sweep. Picked the length early and broomed it away to the third man fence. Key was he rolled his wrists there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ton for the combo!! That was deft, cute, earns a four with the help of an open face of the bat. The dive from the man at short third man spelt agony for Pune. The match continues to slip away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, blasted away. {{BOWLER}} needs to be careful with his lengths here. Errs on the shorter side once more and {{BATSMAN}} gets across to blast it over mid-wicket. Just on the bounce before crashing into the ad hoardings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's peirced the gap to perfection, just a tiny gap between the fielder at point and cover-point and {{BATSMAN}} found it. Played with an open face, allowed the ball to come onto him and gets it in the gap past point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} tries to attack the pads of {{BATSMAN}}. He backs away and chips it over mid-wicket. Fielder from deep square leg tries to get across, but fails to stop the ball from rolling over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classy, shot of ther final so far - on a good length and well wide of off. {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and drives it on the up - splits the gap between cover and cover-point, no need to run for those. 16 from the over and Ravi Shastri notes that MI have doubled their score\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} doesn't like it. He's not happy with himself. Bowls a shortish delivery on leg and {{BATSMAN}} simply puts it away to the square leg fence with a nonchalant clip off his hips, 11 runs off the opening over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short, wide and four, no one moved after {{BATSMAN}} flashed it behind square on the off-side, a poor ball and {{BATSMAN}} took full toll of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky. Deft too in equal proportion. Moves away, manufactures room and opens his bat face ever so late in guiding it very fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! But that's how {{BATSMAN}} plays. No half measures. Darted in outside off and {{BATSMAN}} threw his bat at that, sliced the drive over backward point and started another over with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bowls full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} is seeing it like a hawk. Clears his front leg and clatters it square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more for {{BATSMAN}}, although this has come off a perfectly {{BATSMAN}}cent {{BATSMAN}}livery. Back of a length at the top of off, and it's been met with disdain from {{BATSMAN}} who clears his front leg and slogs it over mid-on. Almost went all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 144.5kph, that's nicely picked away off the hips by {{BATSMAN}}. Another pacy short of length delivery, actually on the stumps, but {{BATSMAN}} got inside the line and helped it away past the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another slower one, leg-cutter, like Ten{{BATSMAN}}lkar predicted in his tweet, and Faf backs away to slap it away through the gap at to extra cover for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, risky but four, {{BATSMAN}} backed away a long way, {{BOWLER}} followed him with a full ball, but {{BATSMAN}} has enough room to free his arms and drives it square behind point, beats third man getting across for his first boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Yuvraj must be wondering what's going on. He's getting yorkers at his end while {{BATSMAN}} gets full tosses. Here is another and it's blasted straight over the bowler's head. Like a rocket to the fence it goes. He's keeping {{TEAM}} alive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} thumps it down the ground. Goes deep and leg-side to free his arms, with mid-off in the ring, he just had to place it wide of him, which he does and collects four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. The move has paid off. He raises his bat and acknowledges the applause from his team mates. He shouldn't have been on strike for this ball. The basics in cricket I tell you. Low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} drills it past mid-off. No stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's lovely placement from {{BATSMAN}}. Another full toss from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't try to over-hit the ball, lofts the drive over cover and beats sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, just a hint of width outside off, {{BATSMAN}} made it look bad by arching back slightly, frees his arms and sends the cut scorching behind square on the off-side, beats third man - running to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four. Third man is square and {{BATSMAN}} got it fine enough to beat him. Just a good length delivery angled across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} went hard on the drive and the outside edge went away quickly to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swinging into the pads, no real threat, {{BATSMAN}} puts it away with a flick of the wrists. No-one at fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, googly but on the shorter length, {{BATSMAN}} does not go hell for leather, slides on the back foot and crunches it square on the off-side, no chance for a diving sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lousy beginning from {{BOWLER}}. Whangs in a short ball on leg-stump line, forgets the fine leg is inside the circle. Easy picking for {{BATSMAN}}, swivels across and helps it over the man at 45. Didn't get it off the middle but enough to clear the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is finding the gaps in the field like a boss. A short ball at the hips and it's been dragged through deep square leg by the southpaw, second boundary of the over. He hasn't taken any risks either\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor from Mills! That was dabbed away with soft hands and the fielder at short third man does the London Bridge and dives over it to open the floodgates for RCB. The momentum has again changed hands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, switches his stance open and reverse-pulls that to the third man fence. Cricket in modern times is truly ridiculous. And fun\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, phew! {{BOWLER}} despite getting a boot on that scorching drive, watches the ball run to the fence in a jiffy. Down the track and drilled so so hard\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh this could so easily have been in mid-on's hands. Shortish delivery, {{BATSMAN}} pulls off the front foot, not in control, Yuvi was very wide there and had no chance. This is the battle of the best bowler v best batsman\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another mediocre delivery by {{BOWLER}}. Drifts this one on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} gets it over square leg with a nonchalant flick, the home crowd is loving this even though the Royals are getting belted here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length balls at this stage. {{BATSMAN}} keeps up with the tradition of putting them away. Gets right iunder it with a burial and just swings his bat through the line. All the timing in spanking it through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, AB gets going, {{BOWLER}} shortened his length as he saw AB's charge. Quick hands does the trick for the Protean superstar, swivels across, rolls his wrists over and pulls it in front of square on the on-si{{BATSMAN}}, beats the man getting across from the {{BATSMAN}}ep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another quick delivery, but errs in line, {{BATSMAN}} moves across, crouches and helps it along its way. Manages to beat short fine leg and there's no one to stop that. Not to forget, a poor effort from Harbhajan who dived over the ball at short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the extra deliveries cost him a boundary. 15 off the over and a much needed one for Delhi. This was also quicker but right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} smacks it straight down the ground for a one bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, freebie to start from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} puts it away in style. Half-tracker and it's asking for trouble on this easy-paced surface. {{BATSMAN}} swivels on the back foot and controls the pull with elan through backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is in some pain but he's keeping the scoreboard ticking. Smacking 'em all over! Goes down on his knee and bludgeons it right over the bowler's head for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed, length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track, takes it on a half-volley length and drills it back past the bowler, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, glorious shot from {{BATSMAN}}. He's come out with a positive intent. Sees the width, transfers his body weight across and slaps it wonderfully past cover. That just rocketed away to the fence in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, throws his hands at it and gets a thick edge. The ball flies away to third man and a lazy effort from Avesh Khan at deep third man allows the ball to slip under his hands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely cut! Back of a length outside off, width on offer and {{BATSMAN}} plays a fine square cut as the ball races away through the backward point region for four runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, plants his foot down and absolutely drills the ball wide of a diving extra-cover. Overpitched from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} blasts him away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh, that's sloppy from KL Rahul. School-boyish error as he fails to get his body behind the line and lets it through his legs. {{BATSMAN}} shaved it towards long-on, KL Rahul moves across to his right and perhaps took his eyes off the ball completely. Don't even look at your skipper, KL..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} is about half a meter outside leg reaches out Sehwagesquely to slice it towards the third man boundary for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} seems to be having no problems on a surface where others have struggled. Short delivery on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} pivots on his front leg and pulls it backward of square, couple of bounces and into the fence. 12 off the first three balls\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice use of the pace from {{BATSMAN}}, sits back in the crease and opens the bat face at the right moment to send it fine of third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, dropped it short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and cuts it behind square on the off-side. Miller was caught wrong-footed and has no chance to recover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a timely hit! He's moved across the stumps, got down on his knees and paddled the fast bowler around the corner through backward square leg. Brave hit! {{BOWLER}} missed the yorker again and offered a full ball on the stumps\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, this is even better, on a good length and just outside off, Singh presses forward, drives it on the up and splits the gap between cover and mid-off. Good early signs for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, precision at its best. A normal seam-up delivery around off and {{BATSMAN}} drives on the up, opens the face of the bat a bit to place it between cover and point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the perfect yorker. Right in the blockhole. Deserved nothing lesser than respect. Gets the boundary to its name instead. {{BATSMAN}} just about jams his bat down in the way, gets the inside edge and then banks on his luck to take it past the stumps\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nothing much wrong with this delivery but {{BATSMAN}} is in magnificent touch now. He identifies the length early, gets in a good position and smashes it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, second time {{BATSMAN}} has got a streaky boundary off {{BOWLER}}. Short and wide outside off, he throws the bat on the cut, right off the cue-end and the ball runs away fine to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slice of luck for {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}}. {{BOWLER}} executes another yorker outside off and {{BATSMAN}} swung himself (quite literally) into that, managed to get a thick inside edge which flies past QDK to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is welcomed to the crease with a boundary. Feeds it full, overpitches it a tad and {{BATSMAN}} makes him pay by cracking it through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is cheeky. Pushed it through did {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} used the pace on that, shuffled across with bent knee and scooped it fine, giving short fine leg no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's sweet from {{BATSMAN}}. Exquisite timing. Good length ball curling away from off, {{BATSMAN}} caresses it on the up through the covers. Just had to find the gap there, races away on this outfield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is switching gears now. But he is aided by {{BOWLER}} here. Juicy full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and slaps it over extra cover, no chance for the sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely batting. Down the track and to the pitch before slamming it in the air, but wide of the diving Russell at mid-off. Consecutive boundaries\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Easily done! {{BATSMAN}} gets low on one knee and laps it away into the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball outside off and {{BATSMAN}} is away. Swats it across the line and gets it wide of mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off. Sheer timing fetches him his first boundary. Fuller and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drives through the line and the timing take care of the rest. There was a fielder in the deep and he had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a gift and {{BATSMAN}} won't miss out. Short of a good length delivery drifting down leg, {{BATSMAN}} tickles it fine. Runs away into the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the two off-breaks he's bowled in this over have both drifted down leg. Unlike the previous one though, {{BATSMAN}} just helps this on its away and gets it fine enough to beat short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that was in the air for a while, but just elu{{BATSMAN}}d the man at mid-off. This {{BATSMAN}}livery was pitched up by {{BOWLER}} and AB played a gentle chip. Almost got {{BATSMAN}}ceived due to the slower one, but luckily he played it with a straight bat to get it past the fiel{{BATSMAN}}r stationed at mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gorgeous shot! Pure class from {{BATSMAN}}. It was a leg-spinner from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track and lofts it with the turn over cover for a four. One of the toughest shots to play but he reached the pitch of the ball and made it easier for himself\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and those are the winning runs! Stand and deliver. Length delivery decking away, {{BATSMAN}} lifts the ball over the in-field and gets it away to the fence for a four to complete the formalities\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the little things in cricket cost you so much. {{BATSMAN}} should have never been on strike, but thanks to Maxwell he was and he collects a boundary. Slower short delivery and {{BATSMAN}} swiveled to pull it behind square, good connection as the ball bounced only once before reaching the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tossed up delivery outside off, not much of spin there and {{BATSMAN}} latches onto it. He smacks the cut behind square on the off-side. The sweeper can't get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, inside-out. That's some welcome. A wobbly seam off a length, looking to follow {{BATSMAN}} as he backs away. But he goes uppish, lofting up a drive over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, this is turning out to be a fine cameo from {{BATSMAN}}, comes down the track, uses his reach to good effect and clears cover with the lofted off-drive, couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunched through cover. Shows the kind of form he's been in this tournament. Short and fraction width provided, enough for {{BATSMAN}} to cash in. Getting on top of the bounce and slapping it in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, 19 from the over, fraction overpitched and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands at it and drills the drive over cover, few bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a well-controlled pull shot from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} did not get height on the short of length delivery, just above the waist and {{BATSMAN}} got on top of that nicely, rolled his wrists and struck it behind square, beating deep square leg with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss wide of off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} thrashes it powerfully square on the off-side. No-one there and it's a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, only with a man of steel-forearms can do it. Short ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} is committed on the pull but the ball does not quite come with pace. He does not flinch, goes with the pull and fetches it from outside off, almost clears the fence at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 200 marks to Billings for the effort. But it is four. Flicked effortlessly by {{BATSMAN}}, races across the turf to deep mid-wicket, Billings dives and pushes it back in play, but the ball rolls back to touch the cushions as the Kent man tried to pull it back the second time. {{BATSMAN}} and de Kock assumed that it would go for four and had to rush to make the third. Eventually all that was not needed as the third umpire judges it correctly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, adding insult to injury. This one sits up outside off on a good length and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't need any second invitation, holds his pose and crunches it wide of cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not convincing, but {{BATSMAN}} will take that. A very good over from {{BOWLER}}. Just misses the length this ball, goes full and that allows {{BATSMAN}} to get underneath and hoick it over mid-wicket. Not off the middle but enough to clear the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more runs! {{BOWLER}} is being taken to the cleaners here. Came round the wicket and actually got his line right but {{BATSMAN}} is in such a mood that he will put even the good ones away. Makes room by backing away and steers it to find the gap. Bisects short third man and backward point with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, quintessentially {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} was from round the wicket to the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} charges down whilst making some room and lofts it through extra cover. Superb hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and now young {{BATSMAN}} takes a leaf out of his skipper's book. The seam-up ball that held its line just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} is pretty glued to the crease and smartly just uses the pace of the bowler to guide it to third man. Beats Sodhi on this occasion, who tried his best but couldn't stop it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the reverse sweep! Played with disdain as he lofted it high over short third man for a four. He did it against the Indian spinners in South Africa. Rang a bell?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fraction short and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to pounce on that, he rocks back and nails the pull in front of square, couple of bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, \"welcome into the attack Mr {{BOWLER}},\" says {{BATSMAN}}. Picks the length on that short one early and makes sure to pummel it over mid-wicket, he's in the zone guys.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, out comes the reverse paddle from {{BATSMAN}}, third man was inside the ring, so he did well to get bat on ball and it escaped to the boundary to ease some pressure\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, some respite for {{TEAM}} as they get a much-needed boundary. Was a bit too straight from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} helped it wide of short fine leg with a neat glance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, here it is! Finally a boundary against {{BOWLER}}. This was a half-volley outside off, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to lean ahead and cream his drive through cover. Beats the two fielders chasing to stop this from reaching the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, is that the game already! Poor short ball wide outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} slaps it hard and splits long-off and deep mid-wicket to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is sworded away! Full and wide, throws his bat at the leather whilst losing his balance and smears the ball over point for a four. That will do for DD. 14 of the over and that is exactly what they need in each of the rest three overs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} makes full use of the free-hit. A quicker delivery on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it wide of short fine leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, NCN overcorrects and dishes out a full toss, {{BATSMAN}} sets up a solid base and drills it past mid-on. Didn't get it off the middle but manages it thread it past the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} has not get his radar right on his yorkers. A low full toss down leg, {{BATSMAN}} is almost down on his knee and swipes it behind square. McClenaghan at fine leg had no chance to cut that off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flatter this time. This is a result of what happened on the previous ball. Ends up on the legs of {{BATSMAN}}, who helps it to the fine leg fence with a little sweet tuck\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bleeding runs here! This is a fab counterattack from these two and the RCB bowlers are wilting under the onslaught. Slower but short with a lot of width, allows {{BATSMAN}} to chance his arms with a slap cut through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh boy! {{BOWLER}} has been {{BATSMAN}}-ed here. If there is ever a term like that. Just stands still, unleashes a strong bottom-hand to slap it through extra cover. Bulleted away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery on the pads and third in a row as the batsman clips the ball away over the man at short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, thats almost an inch-perfect yorker outside off, errs marginally, {{BATSMAN}}, with all his hockey experience, gets under it to bottom-hand that away to the deep extra cover fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not an impressive delivery by {{BOWLER}}. He has sprayed a full toss on the pads in his quest to attempt the yorker. Easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}} was flicks it away to the deep square leg fence. That went flat and for a moment it seemed as if this will go the distance. Alas, it didn't\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too slow and too much time for {{BATSMAN}} to reverse lap it over short third. Well played\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fuller length delivery outside off, the width was there and {{BATSMAN}} threw his bat at that, ended up slicing it over backward point and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time he knows exactly what {{BOWLER}} has bowled. Picks the googly, steps away from the line and opens the face on his cut past backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's hammered! Right into the slot and the big arms take over. KP gets underneath it and smashes it over the bowler's head. Luckily there was some elevation, else {{BOWLER}}'s head could have been in trouble\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes with the turn does {{BATSMAN}} and which is why this slog looks elegant. On top of that, has found the gap too. One bounce and over the ropes at the deep square leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lifts this over the in-field on the off-side. {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark with a four. This should ease his nerves a bit. Too short, too wide and {{BATSMAN}} will not let this go scot-free. Rides the bounce and makes hay\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not sure he intended it to go that fine. Short of length with a bit of extra bounce, {{BATSMAN}} steers it and the outside edge runs away fine - bisecting Dhoni and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} plays the ramp now, safe shot as third man was inside the ring - short and well wide of off, he waited on it, opens the face of the bat and ramps it over the empty slip cordon, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clumsy from Rashid and he looks to be in some trouble - short of a length and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of the bounce and cracked it straight to cover-point - Rashid jammed his fingers at the ball and let it slip through. 'It's paining', he says cheekily later\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, keeps bettering them. {{BOWLER}} keeps it full, {{BATSMAN}} isn't complaining, leans out, and inside-outs it over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now the back-footed punch, typically {{BATSMAN}}, standing on the bounce, arching behind and nailing this between point and cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misses the yorker, not by much and {{BATSMAN}} was quick to squeeze the ball between mid-off and cover for a four. Genius on show\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh goodness! What a strike from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} and the umpire had to take evasive action as it was struck so hard. Can you believe it? Still runs away to the fence. Full and on off, {{BATSMAN}} stomps forward and hammers it back at {{BOWLER}}, who puts up his left hand to take cover. The ball hits him and flies away past a ducking umpire Abhijit Deshmukh to the boundary. That must've hurt and it's his bowling arm\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely whipped away by {{BATSMAN}}. He's timed it beautifully, although {{BOWLER}} did much of the work for him by giving a gentle full ball on the pads. And then {{BATSMAN}} gratefully picked it up backward of square, past fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is playing a gem here. Delhi need him to play a few of these. Flat and quick around off, {{BATSMAN}} premeditates and reverse sweeps it through short third man. Was a well played shot by the southpaw\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Jonny is on fire! He dashes down the ground, wasn't to the pitch of the ball still goes through with the shot and times it well enough to smash it down the ground for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, past Faulkner at backward point. Dives sideways with outstretched right hand but can't stop this brutal cut from {{BATSMAN}}. Saw the width and just laid into it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flicked along the ground, big Polly runs to his right and dives, misses the ball and it escapes for four. Too full from {{BOWLER}} and he pays the penalty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too much of a risk. But when the luck flows for you, you'd better be milking it. And {{BATSMAN}} does it with aplomb. Sinks and without quite picking the wrong 'un slogs it hard and high. Through the hands of a diving Dhawan at the mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, probably another slower ball but this is a fraction short and sits up for {{BATSMAN}} who pulls this over mid-wicket. Picks his spot and gets a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} has lost the plot a bit against {{BATSMAN}}. Goes short and at the body, no pace this time and {{BATSMAN}} is able to pick his spot, swivels around and places the pull backward of square. All along the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, a half-tracker from {{BOWLER}}, short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and clatters it wide of cover - the man in the deep is very square and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, terrific catch from RJ - well, nearly, only he could have got to the ball, ran in a long way from deep mid-wicket, dived across to his left, went one-handed and got to the ball, but it kept going away and bounced past his outstretched hands. Nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, knew that mid-wicket was wide and clipped it high and wide of that fielder - any other fielder and it was an easy boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, tossed up just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went down on his knee, played with the spin and swiped it over mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}. It was a slower one on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} picks it up early and powers the pull shot wide of deep mid-wicket for another four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's on loop. 15.3, 15.4 and 15.5, each one predictable perfectly -- all pace dealt out outside off, lots of width too and this time {{BATSMAN}} picks out deep extra cover with that usual muscular slash\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he has powered this one for another four. {{BATSMAN}} is playing a gem. It was a fuller length delivery wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches for it and pumps it wide of cover for another boundary. He loved it! Punches the air in delight!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full and too easy. Wafted full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, presents a nice high elbow and creams it past mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no need to run for that. It was a full-toss wide of off and {{BATSMAN}} in this form is not going to let it go. He reaches for it and tonks it wide of long-on, it rockets to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, punched down the ground! Hits it on top of the bounce with the full face of the bat and beats mid-off with elan\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, some room and {{BATSMAN}} capitalises on it. Smashes it through the covers for a four. Got the room and pounced on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is spraying them all around. Shortish this time but at a gentle pace and leg stumpish, {{BATSMAN}} just had to beat short fine leg to get a boundary. He ends up clearing that fielder comfortably with a half-pull\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fabulous shot! Good length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stays his ground and lofts it handsomely over extra cover, just an extension of the arms and the connection was exquisite\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, super shot! {{BOWLER}} is being put under pressure here. Flatter and a touch short outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on the back foot and punches this through the gap at backward point. Lovely stuff! Even Kohli cannot help but applaud the stroke\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} again. This time it's short and wide and {{BATSMAN}} slaps it hard through point. It beats the diving fielder inside the ring as well as the one at the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is a stunning shot! Wow! Another fuller one and this time, {{BATSMAN}} was merely pushing it straight back past the bowler. Such amazing timing and the ball just rocketed away. Signs that this is a much better surface than the eliminator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} sets himself up for the reverse sweep, gets a bottom edge and the ball runs fine, past Shaw at short third man and beats his chase to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just the kind of over Punjab needed to get going. 12 runs off it as {{BATSMAN}} square drives the slightly full ball through point and manages to beat the sprinter in the deep. {{BATSMAN}} knocked over {{BOWLER}} at the other end as his eyes were on the ball. The little guy is on the floor..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slings away with the arm, back of a length, a whippy cut attempted, toe-ended away wide of the 'keeper to the third man fence for four. Fortuitous.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he wants to match Kohli, It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} brings his bat down early and sweeps it wide of deep backward square leg for a four. Incredible bat-speed!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the last two deliveries ruins the over for Krishna and KKR. Superb batting though from {{BATSMAN}}. Shuffled across and paddled the back of a length delivery over and wide of short fine leg. Just used the pace of the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} joins the party. Have to say that {{BOWLER}} is releasing all the pressure built with some poor bowling. Once again gifts width outside off and {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for this for a while now. Frees his arms to go over cover. Didn't middle that well but still had enough to go over the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tossed up delivery and has been slog swept! That was floated up and {{BATSMAN}} knelt down to thwack it hard\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, although he shows his cards too early, he has managed to get what he wanted. Some card he had. Stepped down and was followed by a short ball that did not have enough pace. Flat-pulled it along the ground to the deep square leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed! 141.2kph short of length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} sets himself up nicely and slaps it hard over extra cover, goes flat and almost all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slammed! Goes deep in his crease and pulls the short ball to the deep mid-wicket fence with that meaty swing of his\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, thick educated edge. {{BATSMAN}} swishes a punch outside off, running it away really fine for third man to do anything with it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, if he is going to bowl the wide yorker, then third man needs to be back. Yes, it was a bottom edge but the bowler and captain need to be smart, {{BATSMAN}} reached out with a bent back knee and squirted it off the toe-end to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half-volley. Errs in length and {{BATSMAN}} makes full use of...Times the pants of a drive through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smart, really smart from {{BATSMAN}}. Seriously can't understand {{BOWLER}} bowling short and angling outside off stump with third man in, {{BATSMAN}} just uses the pace offered and guides past the fielder inside\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, change of pace from {{BOWLER}}, the slower ball angling across the left-han{{BATSMAN}}r, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across, gets insi{{BATSMAN}} the line and helps it on its way over short fine for another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, thrashed! That was a poor delivery and has been spanked off the back foot. Picked the googly and smashed it past cover for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a shocking delivery. A full toss on the pads from round the wicket, that too with fine leg in. {{BATSMAN}} can't believe his luck as he glances it to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short one at the body, and that's a torso-twisting whippull towards the deep midwicket boundary for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Faf breaks the shackles! Stays put in the crease and lifts the length delivery right over the bowler's head. Can't keep a fielder there and that's a four for the South African, his first one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's no long-off, and {{BOWLER}} dishes out a full toss, aka, juicy freebie, deservedly sliced over mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slams a length ball between mid-wicket and long-on for four! Just mows this away without a care in the world!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, loose ball and {{BATSMAN}} has put it away. On the pads, shortish and {{BATSMAN}} walks down to tuck it away easily wide of short fine leg who was a bit off the mark too. VK isn't amused with that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, excellent footwork from {{BATSMAN}}! This wasn't all that full but he came down the track in a flash and lofted it over {{BOWLER}}'s head. Mid-on was a mere spectator. Top stroke! Not a bad ball at all, just a top shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, whippage! {{BOWLER}} tries the slower delivery but offers a half volley on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and whips it with a lot of bottom hand to deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice way to start the over. {{BATSMAN}} gets a leg-stump half volley and he puts it away nonchalantly, leans forward and flicks it backward of square leg, fine leg was inside the ring and the man in the deep was square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, throws his hands at the width on offer and lashes it through backward point. Two ordinary deliveries from {{BOWLER}} back-to-back. Not good\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, make that four fours of the over, banged in short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side. {{BOWLER}} was expensive in the final of IPL 2016, he has started badly here once again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 8000 runs in T20s for {{BATSMAN}}, reaches the milestone in a streaky fashion. Pitched up just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat hard seeking for a swing downtown, gets a thick inside edge which misses the stumps and runs away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, on to 90* is {{BATSMAN}}. On a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands at it and smacks it over the cover fence, on a few bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, really ordinary bowling. It's a gentle short of length delivery on off-stump, the ball sits up for {{BATSMAN}} who bludgeons it through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50-run stand up for the third wicket but Samson has done majority of the scoring! {{BATSMAN}} had flicked it to fine leg where Kaul slides to stop the ball. When he releases the ball to throw it, the fielder is in contact with the ropes. Nothing going SRH's way, nothing!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ohh! Shikhar, you cheeky, cheeky fellow. He shuffles well wide of off, {{BOWLER}} bowls it in his area. And it was on a fuller length, the length and line was ideal for {{BATSMAN}} to scoop it over short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the airrrr, in the gap and a poor effort from Dan Christian meant the ball escaped for four. He had to dive, thought about it, but took a long while to react. {{BOWLER}} bowls full and outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} lofts the drive inside-out, could have been cut off by the man running from long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} finally connects one. A wide delivery that was angled across the left hander who punches it past the fielder at cover. The fielder in the deep was way too square in order to cut this down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, handy runs for {{BATSMAN}}, on a length and tailing back into the right-hander, he waited on it and then clipped it backward of square on the on-side - right in the gap between the two fielders in the ring and it runs away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, a friendly half-volley outsi{{BATSMAN}} off and {{BATSMAN}} is off and running with a boundary, leans into the drive and places it straight of mid-off, the fiel{{BATSMAN}}r didn't have a chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, driven wide of long-off, oh dear, Hardik Pandya has let this go through between his legs. Off-drive along the ground, should have been stopped\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a hang on the front foot and keeps his mace flat as he forearms a smash back past the bowler. So typically {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the shackles are showing signs of coming lose - reaches out and slices this marginally wide one square of the wicket for four...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shortish and {{BATSMAN}} has pulled. This is a seriously good cameo from {{BATSMAN}}. Came in at the fall of two big wickets, but kept the shots coming. This one's pulled over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another one that doesn't really have width, a short one, but even though he's cramped for room, he's picked up the length quick enough to hit the middle with the pull and club it away towards long-on for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary of the innings! {{BATSMAN}} makes the most of the provided width. It's a short of a length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches for it and slams it through the gap at cover-point to gather his first boundary of the innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a way to get off the mark in IPL for {{BATSMAN}}. Leans across to a full ball and blasts it through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is such a dangerous player at the top and this is why? Gets a short ball outside off, he half-swivels and pulls nonchalantly over mid-wicket. No-one there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is pure wrist power. This was the slower ball, but it went too full, meaning that the batsman had a bit of extra time to react, {{BATSMAN}} flicked nicely along the ground through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a nice hit over wide long-off, with the spin, off the front foot, decently timed. Oh the lofted inside-out drive is a great feeling!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, outside edge and it's escaped past the diving man at slip, fullish delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} plays inside the line and tries to push at the ball, gets away with it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor first ball from {{BOWLER}}, dropped it short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and crunches it wide of point, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice way to get going, banged in short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, comes down the track and slaps it high and behind square on the off-side. Almost went all the way, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a sweep off a seamer. A major punch on the ego for sure. 127kph, on the sitting up length in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} strolls well across, sits on a knee and unleashes a flat bat to place it to perfection behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length delivery at the body, swivelled away past short fine leg. But it doesn't matter. MI clinch this by three runs to stay alive in the tournament\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and effective! A dibbly-dobbly length ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} gets down on a knee and paddles it over short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's been absolutely lambasted through extra cover. Back of a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slaps it red, leaves a vapour trail enroute to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now that's brilliant placement from {{BATSMAN}}. Third man up, so {{BATSMAN}} uses the width on offer on this good length delivery, allows the ball to come and guides it to the left of backward point and it came from the middle of the bat as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a boundary to cap off the over. 16 off it. Short and hint of width provided, {{BATSMAN}} exploits it by riding the bounce and spanks it crisply through extra cover. No long-off and {{BATSMAN}} collects four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, he's getting a move on, length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} delayed his drive by a moment and then placed it wide of extra-cover - no one in the deep and the ball ran away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} loves pace on the ball. He's at ease when he plays the fast bowlers. {{BOWLER}} went full searching for swing, but went as a juicy half-volley, {{BATSMAN}} drives it to the right of extra-cover and it raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flicked away to the mid-wicket boundary. No one bothers to move. Huge open space in the field. Poor from DD. Not at all mindful of the net run rate\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} latches onto it, on this occasion. Pushed through quicker on middle, {{BATSMAN}} took some time in getting his bat down on the heave, gets it off the inner half in the pocket between short fine leg and square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower back of length ball again, this time there's a little bit of width which allows AB to carve it away between backward point and short third man. It was uppish, but the placement was spot on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} charges himself for another flay, goes deep and carves it away over point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, biceps and triceps. Wrists and fists from {{BATSMAN}}. Gets into business by backing away to leg and hammers it over the bowler's head. So powerful! Picked the safest spot in the ground as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this guy has talent. Make no mistake about it. Turns a near yorker into a boundary. Special skill when you can do that. Backed away a tad and directed it with an open face, just wide of short third, who didn't get across. Should've done better\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft touch from {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} dropped one short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room, waits on it, uses the pace on the ball and dabs it late, beats Sandeep at short third man and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 129ks on a back of a length, and veering down, there's only one way the ball's going. To the boundary. Pulled behind square\n",
            "{{BATSMAN}} {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, terrific shot! Flighted delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} whips it with a lot of class and authority. It beats deep mid-wicket and canters to the fence. He is in fabulous touch!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played! Fraction fuller and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and punches it back at the bowler. {{BOWLER}} got a hand onto it, but it still beats mid-off to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's back-to-back boundaries now. {{BATSMAN}} has changed gears and he got the momentum he wanted. It's another short ball from {{BOWLER}}, not the kind of short ball that rises to head, {{BATSMAN}} stays back and flat-bats it over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely guided away to third man, a slide by Deepak Chahar and he's let the ball go through. Dhoni won't be happy, with the bowler first for needlessly trying stuff, and with the fielder for his effort. Hat-trick of fours now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drilled, {{BOWLER}} kept it full and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, makes room and drives it through the gap at extra-cover, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, this is excellent batting, fired short and down leg, he bends down low, uses the pace on the ball and laps it over short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, latches on. It's that sitting up length, and {{BATSMAN}} goes flat-batted, riding the bounce and timing the leather off it through cow corner, splitting the two men converging. In the hope of converging\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, paddlescooped just past short fine leg! Once again, {{BATSMAN}} hasn't got it off the middle but still has enough wood to get it past the fielder in the ring. Walked across very early, signaling his intentions to this fuller ball, had to fetch it from outside off but his brisk initial movement allowed him to do that, just\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, jumps out, looks to slam it away into the on-side and gets a fine inside edge for the ball to whizz past the keeper to his right for a four. Streaky but much needed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 137kph on the pads. And it doesn't even pitch. Oh my. {{BATSMAN}}'s swipes, heaving it into square leg, flat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, maiden IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He punches the air in delight! We have found another 360 degree player! Whatta cameo this has been! He moves to the off-side, takes it on the full and paddles it fine of fine leg for another four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another beautiful shot! {{BATSMAN}} is turning it on. Sees width on offer and just eases it through backward point. Just relied on timing and boy, didn't he time the pants off this one! Sweeper tried hard but was never chasing it down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done by {{BATSMAN}}! This tailed in sharply from a fullish length but the line was a bit too straight. Clipped away sweetly past the diving mid-wicket fielder and it raced away to the fence. {{TEAM}} are away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top shot! {{BOWLER}} overpitches with mid-off inside the circle. {{BATSMAN}} stays leg-side of the ball and thumps it over wide mid-off. One bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, another wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}}, fraction short and spinning back into the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} didn't pick it as he went for the cut - cramped up for room, gets a thick outside edge that brushes Rahul's gloves and runs away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, serene! The format might demand slam bang wham. But a back foot cover drive with a lean into the shot and hitting it on top of the bounce is welcomed all day long. He trampled back to stroke it off the back foot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fuller and this has been deliciously chipped over mid-wicket. All timing. No show.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fabulous shot! Wee bit of space offered from {{BOWLER}} on this flighted delivery and that is enough for {{BATSMAN}} to put it away, strides forward and creams the drive through cover. The timing ensures that sweeper is also beaten\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Archer is disappointed with himself. Overpitched flighted delivery and {{BATSMAN}} drills the drive straight down the ground, Archer gets across from long-on and tries to stop it with one hand, the ball does not stick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just can't bowl straight to {{BATSMAN}}. The slower delivery drifts with the round the wicket angle, flicked away with a lot of bottom hand in front of square, beating the fielder in the deep comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nails this overpitched delivery straight back down the ground. This is excellent batting. They've not allowed Rahane to get through a few cheap overs of spin which he would've so dearly loved\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nothing wrong this time. Right off the middle. Kumar offers width wide of off on this short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} takes advantage of it. He punches it and bisects cover and cover-point. Races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swept from in front of off-stump and Tye's lazy at the deep square leg ropes. Doesn't bend down enough as he picks it one-handed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's one of his trademark shots. Saw the full middle stump delivery and then went inside out over cover. No chance for Polly at long-off. Gets forward and then gives himself room to get the elevation\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four runs! Will he make them pay for that dropped catch? A back of length delivery by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} heaves it through mid-wicket as the fielder in the deep fails to stop it even after his dive, parrying it away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 149.2km/h, really quick, but strays on the pads, a full-toss, whipped away to the deep mid-wicket boundary for four. Easy pickings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it was boom or bust for {{BATSMAN}} with three dots, he decides it is the latter. Charges down and converts it into a full length delivery, cracks the drive past extra cover and there was no stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh he's bludgeoned this very hard. Full and outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} slices the ball hard and gets it in the gap at cover-point, the fielder in the deep had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant placement from {{BATSMAN}}. Bisects two men in the deep to perfection. Showing a piece of geometry that would put Euclid to shame. {{BOWLER}} strays it on the pads again, {{BATSMAN}} gets right behind it and clips it behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, backs away against this arm-ball and hacks it through mid-wicket. He's got it between long-on and deep mid-wicket, and despite a committed dive from Manish Pandey, he can only parry the ball into the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picks the slower ball and thumps it through extra-cover. Carnage in Indore. It was a back of length off-cutter and somehow {{BATSMAN}} managed to infuse enough power on the drive off the back foot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, a rare loose ball from {{BOWLER}}, dragged short and wide of off, cracked square behind point and the ball runs away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a good little cameo this from {{BATSMAN}}. He's handling himself really well. Short of length into the body, he swivels nicely and pulls it away through backward square. Uppish but in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and punished! Width on offer outside off, {{BATSMAN}} plays a upper cut and sends this loosener to the boundary at deep point. Still no six in this innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third boundary of the innings and all have been to the same area - fine leg. Quicker one from {{BOWLER}}, probably put off a bit by {{BATSMAN}}'s initial walk down the pitch and it's fed on the pads. Swept away past short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's in overdrive is {{BATSMAN}}! Jumps out of his crease, shows no signs of fear and pumps {{BOWLER}} straight down the ground for a one-bounce boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunches the drive through the covers and that is it! {{TEAM}} win!! They will spring to the top of the points table thanks to this mauling. The target of 183 never ever looked enough. Going back to the final ball: in the zone and {{BATSMAN}} threaded the ball into the gap with a lot of muscle power\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, here's the brute. A short one here that refuses to get up. A bare 123kph and {{BATSMAN}} spanks it with utter disdain. Pulls the leather off it to mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sits up perfectly. {{BATSMAN}} up there tall, already given himself loads of room and carts it over the covers. Nothing streaky here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky! Normal pace delivery from {{BOWLER}} but he's offered space outside off, {{BATSMAN}} allows the ball to arrive and runs it away fine to third man. The ball raced away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, okay, {{TEAM}}'s engine has started to rev up. Both batsmen changing gears now. {{BOWLER}} keeps bowling it wider, {{BATSMAN}} got into a good position and also anticipated it to be on the shorter side. Slapped it ferociously past extra cover and it trickles to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fetches it from outside off and heaves it between mid-wicket and long-on. Shuffled just a bit from leg to off, got behind the line and let his bottom hand take over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball and a front-footed {{BATSMAN}} mows it over mid-on. No shame in conceding a boundary to that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, squeezes the drive in the gap between cover and point. Wide yorker from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} gets his bat down quickly and times it superbly to pick up his second boundary of the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what timing from {{BATSMAN}} there. Gets on his toes and accomodates the bounce and angle from {{BOWLER}}, tucks through backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air... but safe! Length ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} checks his drive and manages to elude the bowler. Any other day and this would have been a catch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fetches the length ball from outside off and drags the sweep away into the on-side. The ball raced away square of the wicket on the on-side for a four. Didn't time it but had enough on it for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}}'s turn for some charity work. Second full toss {{BATSMAN}} has got this innings and he has put that away, heaved wide of mid-wicket, got it high on the bat but more importantly had found the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full again, but too much width on this occasion and {{BATSMAN}} roundhouses it to the cover boundary. Just lashed at the ball and got it away through the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} misses his length horribly this time. It was a slower nut on the stumps and was a full-toss, {{BATSMAN}} moves to the off-side and half-scoops it fine of short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misses the yorker by inches and that's good enough for DK. Went back and got under it, drilling it uppishly through a very straight long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, these runs are hurting Royals, really bad. Both batsmen are looking unstoppable. Shortish delivery on leg, {{BATSMAN}} swivels his pull past the fielder at short fine and ends the over with a boundary again. How often has that happened tonight!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pushed through flatter and wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and flat-bats the slap - beats {{BOWLER}} and races away to the fence in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! Not where he intended but will take the final result. Steps out and aims for a nudge into the on-side, the inside edge nutmegs him and runs away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundary to end the over. The short of length delivery sits up on the surface, {{BATSMAN}} had plenty of time to swivel and nail the pull in front of square, no chance for Ferguson this time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classy, that's why he's the best in the business, {{BOWLER}} dropped his length short and wi{{BATSMAN}} outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, AB was shuffling across, adjusts well and slaps it over cover, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, long-off had around 10 yards to cover and he couldn't get there. That is the power of {{BATSMAN}}. Races down the wicket and gets to the pitch of the ball, lofts it hard and over extra cover, one bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh dear. Ishan Kishan has defied the laws of living and walked through a ball at long leg. Or so it looked. Whipped off the pads, shipped away using the bottom hand and Kishan was charging in, and ran through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there he comes racing down the pitch to the offie with the ball turning in and plays the lofted drive, didn't connect with the middle of the bat, toe-ends it well enough to beat mid-off into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} starts off in a stellar fashion. It was full and was curving away from {{BATSMAN}}, he waits for the ball to deviate and guides it wide of cover for a boundary. He doesn't try to hit it too hard. Sweet timing!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the carnage continues, flighted delivery down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} sweeps, past the diving fielder at short fine leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, two fielders dived and both could not stop the ball. Trifle short and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to go back and whip it, first beats the dive of mid-on and then deep mid-wicket's. Placed to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped! A relatively easy chance by Jadeja's standards. DK muscles the pull and it was hit flat to the right of the fielder at deep mid-wicket, Jaddu got there quickly but the momentum was always taking him to his right and he seemed to have lost the trajectory momentarily as he tried to take it in front of his face. Sneaks through his fingers and travels to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more. He's a smart customer, is the pocket-rocket {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} is under pressure now. Peppered it short outside off, {{BATSMAN}} cleverly arched his back at the last moment and elevated it over the slip. Third man had no chance and he'll collect a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's called improvisation. Picks the length early again, goes back in his crease and guides this towards the third man fence. Opened the face of the bat real late and got a cheeky boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} cracks it past mid-off to bring his second four of the over. The idea from {{BOWLER}} was to bowl a yorker but could not control it there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the tap's opened. {{BOWLER}} tries going wider and fuller, but {{BATSMAN}} still finds a way to get under it and slice over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's class for you. The off-side is packed and {{BATSMAN}} nonchalantly walks across the stumps, tempts the bowler to bowl at the stumps, {{BOWLER}} delivers a slower ball, {{BATSMAN}} had ample time to flick along the ground, made sure he placed it well wide of deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one of {{BATSMAN}}'s best IPL innings this, brings up his fifty in 25 balls. Picks the slower ball early, times his swivel and pulls it past the diving left hand of short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third boundary of the over as {{BOWLER}} drops it short again and this time, {{BATSMAN}} pulls him away to the deep mid-wicket boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hammered away. Cannot bowl that length at this pace to {{BATSMAN}}. He'll punish you all night. Back of a length from {{BOWLER}} and it's pulled away wide of mid-on. All too easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how good is he with those cuts and carves on the off-side. Sits deep in his crease, waits for the full delivery and then at the last moment opens the face of the bat to drive in the air, there's a fielder placed exactly for that shot, but the ball bounces wide of him and speeds to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overpitched slower one and that's been burnt down to long-on. Absolutely drilled away with little respect\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, a floaty half-volley from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, closes the face of the bat and drives it back past the non-striker, no chance for the man at mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time backward square leg is back for {{BOWLER}}, but {{BATSMAN}} sweeps this very fine from him and also takes out the man at 45, nicely placed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, switches to round the wicket to {{BATSMAN}}, who's laid into this room offered outside off. Cracks it with a slash over third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! What wristwork. He backed away and {{BOWLER}} follows him, almost cramped for room is {{BATSMAN}}, but still manages to whip it wide of long-on. The strong wrists come into play to execute that shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in his half and he smashes it for a one-bounce four over mid-wicket. Good, clean swing of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a nice pull shot, he's short in stature, but he packs a punch with his shots. A gentle step forward and then a pull over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the gangly {{BATSMAN}} makes his intentions clear. He wants to have a piece of slinga {{BOWLER}}. Waits deep inside the crease and bludgeons a full ball back over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, looks to push at it, the ball nips in from the surface and tickles the inside edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, flatter and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and pulls it wide of long-on, the fielder gets across, puts in the slide and can't haul the ball back in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, so very beautiful. And trust {{BATSMAN}} to come up with them time and again -- this time courtesy just a punch, splitting the two covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picks the legbreak and pumps the drive over cover, excellent batting this from {{BATSMAN}}. Making great use of the fielding restrictions and looking to pierce gaps as often\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no respect whatsoever for {{BOWLER}}. Is greeted with a boundary. Short with no real venom, {{BATSMAN}} goes back and muscles the pull over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, adding insult to injury. Poor follow up delivery from {{BOWLER}}, drifting on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} duly puts it away with a fine clip off his pads over short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, okay, it's tennis now. {{BATSMAN}}'s already standing in a very-open stance, swatting this short-wide delivery like a forehand smash over mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's completely mistimed, yet {{BATSMAN}} will get a boundary, this game is so cruel for the bowlers. Flighted googly outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to loft that over long-on, but got it on the outside half of the bat, cleared mid-off and it ran away for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, right off the screws. A charge down the track in perpendiculars moving down and away in the same motion. All the breathing space for his arms in slicing it with all the power through the covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four runs! Will he make them pay for that dropped catch? A back of length delivery by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} heaves it through mid-wicket as the fielder in the deep fails to stop it even after his dive, parrying it away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft. Delicate. Cheeky. The wide slip tactic not quite making much sense now. With {{BATSMAN}} using his surgical precision in bisecting the man out there and the keeper with his delayed steer\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, makes room to a length delivery on the stumps and swipes it over the infield, clears cover-point and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and finally a four! Smart play from the Aussie. Was a full ball, {{BATSMAN}} opened the bat face and placed it in the gap between short third and point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely hit inside-out by Washi! The googly from {{BOWLER}}, seemed to have picked that from the hand, got a stride forward and lofted that beautifully over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, welcome, Mr. {{BOWLER}}. This is {{BATSMAN}} at his best. Full delivery outside off, he has a good front foot stride, the high elbow and the straight bat - creams the drive textbook style through extra cover. None of the fielders moved\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! {{BOWLER}} tries the same full wide delivery to {{BATSMAN}} but ends up conceding the boundary. This was right in the slot for the Delhi skipper, uses his reach and lifts it handsomely over extra cover, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one bounce and over the ropes. Making batting look so simple is {{BATSMAN}}. Waits for this length ball to arrive and lifts the punch over mid-off with impeccable timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wide full toss and {{BATSMAN}}'s carved it over the infield square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's the mother of all cross-batted shots! @149.4km/h, no width on the short of length delivery, and a straight pull past the non-striker to the long-off fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} drags his length back, drops it short and on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, pulled away over square leg for another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bang in the slog, at pace .. and AB's already crouches un{{BATSMAN}}r as he waits and smokes this over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, neatly driven and it beats the packed off-side field. Half-volley just outside off, tempting Sharma who leans across and creams it magnificently through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 134.1kph. So damn deft. A seam up outside off, and {{BATSMAN}}, lines himself up, opening his bat face very late, just to guide it through the cordon. The empty cordon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, eventful first over from {{BOWLER}}, a wicket and 16 runs. Another freebie to end his over, short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was all over it as he cracked it square past point, beats the inner ring and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the punches are out. A wide, short combo this and dealt with a certain degree of aplomb. Shows the leather the full face of the blade and crashes it through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a dream start from {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} dropped one short and just wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} backed away and cracked it square past cover, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sixth fifty for Mr. 360! That was shortish, the batsman jumped on the opportunity and muscled the ball away past the dive from the man at {{BATSMAN}}ep square leg. Superb execution\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} welcomes {{BOWLER}} with a boundary! It was a slower one on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} whips it in between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket. He found the gap to perfection! The placement was the key their!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Shikhar Dhawan makes a mess. There wasn't even a single there, but the batsman will get a boundary instead. Yuvi had swept the flatter delivery towards short fine leg where Shikhar misfields and lets it past him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, this was tossed up well outside leg, {{BATSMAN}} went down low, reversed his stance, got on top of the bounce and then found the gap behind square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, more luck for {{BATSMAN}}, full and wide of off from Shardul. {{BATSMAN}} saw the width and threw his hands at that, gets a thick edge that flies past Dhoni and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery from {{BOWLER}} to follow-up. Short, wide and {{BATSMAN}} is right on top of it, cracks the cut behind square and third man was only picking it up from the rope. {{TEAM}} are off and running\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} slashes at it, gets it over the infield towards third man for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} showing his class now. Sees the width outside off and helps it wide of short third man. With the field inside the circle on the off-side, this shot was always on the cards\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and he's back to dishing out length. {{BATSMAN}} lets it get parallel, slices his cut violently, powerfully, one-bounced behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is what he was trying to do the previous ball. Gets it spot on this time. Waits on the back of length delivery, allows it to pass him and then taps it just beside the keeper to have it racing into the third man boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from Shardul, {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of the bounce and cracks it square on the off-side, beats the fielder at point and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball from {{BOWLER}} which is almost nonchalantly dispatched through midwicket. Way too easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's the genius of {{BATSMAN}}. He was beaten in flight and had he not reached out low and found bat on ball, would've given Kishan a chance for a stumping, but stretches to his full reach and then carves it over wide long-off, for a one bounce over the ropes four. Incredible\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's the over spoiled, tried the offie again but sprayed it down the leg-side, fine leg was inside the ring and {{BATSMAN}} happily helps it on its way over short fine leg. Gee he's looking ominous\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, charges down and {{BOWLER}} makes him reach out by firing it outside off, {{BATSMAN}} still goes through with the big hit and the outside edge flies away fine, beating Pant to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a gift and {{BATSMAN}} gleefully accepts! Short and wide from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} climbs into the cut and deposits it over cover, a couple of bounces and the ball rolls into the ad hoarding\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length delivery angled away outside off, {{BATSMAN}} delightfully ramps it over slip. Lovely touch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's been pushed down the order but {{BATSMAN}} is off and running. Slower delivery from {{BOWLER}}, reared up a touch and {{BATSMAN}} was through the pull early. Fat top-edge loops over short fine leg and trickles away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gives himself a lot of room as he skates down the pitch, pierces the gap between extra cover and mid-off to perfection. Fast hands, full flow of the willow. Jos-outrageously-talented-{{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball outside off and the batsman opens the face of the bat to run it down past the man at short third man for a four. A despairing dive from Faulkner is not enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed! Abhishek was at the receiving end a couple of overs back, it's {{BOWLER}} now. Touch fuller outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink and bludgeons it past the man at wide long-off, beating his dive near the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is even better. This was not all that short but {{BATSMAN}} made room for himself, stayed back and went inside out over cover, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full ball on off, drilled into the pitch and bounces over {{BOWLER}}'s head before racing away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not a great day for {{BOWLER}} in the field. Since that run-out of Samson, nothing has gone his way. Even this was a false shot but the end result is a boundary. Nothing's working for the speedster. Drags back the length on his delivery and {{BATSMAN}} ends up top-edging it over the keeper's head as he hacks across the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and gets funky. Shuffles, doesn't mind showing away his stumps as he scoops this one really fine .. 18 off this one, 205 in all, and Bangalore nail the perfect finish!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, textbook-esque inside-out loft from {{BATSMAN}}. All class from Robbie. Expensive over for RCB. Nothing delivery from {{BOWLER}}, pitches it right in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and just stylishly lifts it over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, with all the power hitters back in the hut, the onus falls on {{BATSMAN}} to get {{TEAM}} to a good score. He waits for the slower delivery and back cuts it behind point - bisecting short third man and backward point expertly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's changing his gears now. Runs down the track, takes this floater on the full and drills it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classy shot! He has been out of form but strokes like these should set {{BATSMAN}} up nicely. Half-volley and not all that wide, but he leans nicely to caress the drive through the covers. Raced away to the fence in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, terrible delivery and has been put away. {{BATSMAN}} rocked back and allowed the bat flow to take over and cut it past point. The man at deep cover had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is playing a gem here! He isn't trying to hit too hard just relying on placement. And he is placing them really well. It was a slower one on a short of length, {{BATSMAN}} picks it up early, delays the bat swing and pulls it wide of fine leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has stepped on the gas now. The slower short of length delivery and he's into position quickly, swivels and places the pull with a nice wrist roll backward of square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, {{BATSMAN}} was clueless when he last batted against {{BOWLER}}, but he gets away with a boundary first ball this time. Nothing convincing about the shot though, this was the off-cutter that gripped the surface and was pushed across the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} went hard on the cut, got a fat top-edge that flew in the gap between the keeper and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good shot. Looked pretty. Was bowled full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} had made the room early but inclines his weight across, pinned on his front foot, and smothers the drive through covers. 92 off 36\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stand and admire! That's a scorching drive. Wow. That's not a half-volley, not even close. But {{BATSMAN}} still manages to blaze it away on the up. He hit that uppishly but found the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slogged away! {{BATSMAN}} gets his first boundary of the night. Goes down on his knee and places the slog to perfection. Finds the pocket at cow-corner and that shall spoil {{BOWLER}}'s opening over. Had conceded only six till then, but the boundary takes it into double digits\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! This was brute power. Dismissive stuff from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} floats up a half-volley just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} with his quicksilver hands lunges across and slaps it with precision through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Delhi inching closer to the target! {{BATSMAN}} is looking unstoppable, just like he was against KKR. Latches on to the short ball and swivel-pulls this one through backward square leg, beats the sprinter in the deep quite comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 134.9kph, full toss on leg from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it away handsomely over square leg for a one-bounce four. Good start to the over for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off the toe of the willow but enough to beat third man to his right. Width on offer outside off and {{BATSMAN}} stays his ground before cutting it past the man at backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, on a good length and in that channel outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans across, opens the face of the bat at the last moment, uses the pace on the ball and runs it past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a bit ambitious.. and he's gotten some lucky runs here. Stays back and wants a stylish and uppish back foot punch through covers. Not in control of the bounce and the outside edge flies over the lone slipper in place\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more! A desperate dive to his left in the deep from Mayank, but in vain. A length ball and {{BATSMAN}} walked across towards off to clip it away through mid-wicket using those mighty wrists. Agarwal got a hand to it, but couldn't stop the ball from going past the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a shot that is. Nothing wrong with the delivery. {{BATSMAN}} gives himself room and thumps it wide of mid-off. No chance of stopping those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flies away off the outside edge through to the third man boundary. Short of length outside off, maybe not the best option from {{BOWLER}} as it gives a slashing {{BATSMAN}} more than a fifty-fifty chance. He just needed to get something on it, which he did\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's clumsy from the fielder at extra cover. This should've been stopped. I guess Lomror is the culprit, Smith ain't happy. A fuller length delivery just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} just sublimely drives it crisply and sends it to extra cover where Lomror couldn't get his body in-line and fumbles. It scurries away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy-peasy for {{BATSMAN}}. Vrooming down leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and tickles it fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, expertly done. Uses his quick-silver hands to direct this wide yorker into the third man fence. Gets his bat down in time and threaded the gap between short third man and backward point with perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has made his mind up. He isn't deviating from it. This is what he'll do, live or die. Length ball at the stumps, and he sweeps it away through square leg. It was uppish, and there was a fielder in the ring, but he got it to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and slices high towards the cover region, Krunal comes in from wide long-off to dive and cut it off, but he's touching the boundary as he does that - boundary it is...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, on the off-side now! Fuller ball on middle and off, {{BATSMAN}} is sensing the lengths early and backs away for the loft over cover. Carved it away over the infield with ease. He is getting into the groove\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, width. Throws his hands out. Without holding anything back in the process. Skews off the outside half of the blade in the process. Not bad with third man inside the circle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a poor delivery from {{BOWLER}}. Easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}. Drifts it on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and just helps it fine past the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the partnership between {{BATSMAN}} and Pant is now 50. Sublime! Pitched up delivery outside off and {{BATSMAN}} cracks the drive past cover for a four. The ball sped away past cover in a flash. Stand and deliver from Gabbar\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is turning out to be a very expensive over from {{BOWLER}}, short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across and pulls it behind square on the on-side, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the idea was to steer it to third man, but {{BATSMAN}} got it finer than he would have liked. Slower delivery angled across the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} gets an edge that eludes Karthik to his right. Should he have gone for the catch? Tough one to call\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back to back fours for {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} goes quick and flat outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and slaps it through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, all timing. Back, lining himself behind and drills it to mid-off's right. Ashwin isn't the quickest, manages a palm. The outfield isn't Punjab's ally either\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a gift and {{BATSMAN}} accepts it with glee, full-toss outside off, all {{BATSMAN}} had to do was to find the gap, he gets forward and drills it to the right of extra-cover, no chance for the fielder getting across from long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, early signs that this deck is a beauty. It was banged in short, came at a comfortable hip-height for {{BATSMAN}} and he whips it over short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is putting on a show here - {{BOWLER}} leaks 16 in his first over, width on offer and {{BATSMAN}} chopped it behind square on the off-side, to backward point's right and the man in the deep had a lot to do - can't get there despite the slide\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wrong line from {{BOWLER}}. Lands it outside leg and {{BATSMAN}} is quickly down on his knee to play the sweep, picked the googly and slotted it wide of the deep backward square. The fielder had no chance of stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Rahane almost pulls off a stunner. Slower short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} takes it on, the pull goes in front of square and Rahane covered a lot of ground from deep mid-wicket, dives full length to his right and gets both hands, but the ball pops out once he hit the surface and rolls into the ad cushions. He might have hurt himself there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer and {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of it with the cut - behind square on the off-side and races away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets the width, makes it look worse moving away and inside-outs it over extra cover. Ah, the delight of watching him open\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a proper half-volley at the stumps, beautifully whipped away wide of mid-on. Excellent wrists from {{BATSMAN}}. {{TEAM}} off to a flier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four. The googly with some extra bite, {{BATSMAN}} was taken aback by the bounce and tried to withdraw his bat, but the outside edge had already been found and it raced away fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} welcomes {{BOWLER}} with a boundary. A front foot pull shot by {{BATSMAN}} as the bowler goes slightly short. That's the kind of form these openers are in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} continues to deal in boundaries. Rocks back, picks the length early and punches it through the gap at covers again, away she goes, into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the gallops are out. Jumps down, goes away, frees his arms and rubs the pressure inducing salts on the comeback. A half volley to help himself and throws everything his hands have on it to carve it through the covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, terrific shot, {{BATSMAN}} portrays his class. It was a fuller length ball at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} brings his bat down gun-barrel straight and drives it straight down the ground for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tweaks a touch outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes with hard hands as he looks to go stright of mid-off/cover. Thick outside edge escapes past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, replica of the previous delivery. Believe in luck? Another short delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes after it and gets an inside edge, past the stumps again to meet the fine leg boundary in succession.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's an entirely empty deep mid-wicket, so Faf walks across his stumps and tucks this uppishly with a lot of bottom hand into that area. Just timing, checked timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much needed boundary for SRH. A walk down the track from {{BATSMAN}} to on-drive the short of length delivery to the right of {{BOWLER}}. No chance for long-on. High elbow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 145kph, full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lifts it over mid-off. Used the bowler's pace to his advantage. A couple of bounces and into the fence. Good start to the over for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time shows off his prowess over the backward point region. {{BOWLER}} isn't afraid to flight it, even after getting hit, but {{BATSMAN}} backs away and slices it over the infield, four more, just opened the bat face at the point of impact and elu{{BATSMAN}}d the hor{{BATSMAN}} of fiel{{BATSMAN}}rs in the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, massive moment in the game. Tentative defence from {{BATSMAN}}, the ball turns away from him to take the edge which goes between keeper and slip. Was Morris standing too wide? He barely had time to move before it went through. {{BOWLER}} doesn't know what to do\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, these are useful runs for Royals. They'll take it and {{BATSMAN}} is playing a sweet little cameo here. A full length delivery outside off and the batsman slices it over point and gets a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short, wide and four, a bad ball from {{BOWLER}} at 133 kmph, {{BATSMAN}} had to reach out as he steered the cut over backward point, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, touch short, {{BATSMAN}} picks up the length quickly, goes deep in the crease and pulls it through deep mid-wicket for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 125.1kph, {{BOWLER}} resorts to a slower ball from a shortened length. {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and swings his bat hard to hammer it over vacant straight mid-on. One bounce and into the fence. The long-on fielder didn't even bother to move\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more! {{BOWLER}} pitches it up this time. {{BATSMAN}} presses forward and checks his drive. The ball falls wide and short of GG at covers and the ball rolls into the extra cover fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, throws his bat at a wide one and sends a thick edge wide of Rahane at second slip. Good effort from Shreyas Gopal at third man to cover a lot of ground to his left, but he fumbled a touch while on the dive and it runs away for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, appeal for LBW and umpire Anil Chaudhary has got it spot on. Right off the back boot. Low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to sweep it, missed and the ball runs away off the right boot. The ball had pitched outside leg and hence a good decision from the umpire\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh this is sublime batting from {{BATSMAN}}. Knows {{BOWLER}} is going for the wide yorker with third man inside the ring and he smartly squeezes it in the gap between short third man and backward point. A massive 27-run-game-killing over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drilled. {{BOWLER}} pitches it up and is dispatched with disdain. {{BATSMAN}} does not bother to move his feet and hammers the drive past a hapless AB at mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} and his golf hits I tellya. This isn't off the middle, but that bottom hand power and the baseball swing takes it the distance, just one bounce and over the long-on ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he announced his return to form in the previous game, and here's another superb shot. Gets off the mark on the first ball of the innings as he creams the floated delivery through covers with sublime timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, massive over. 21 off it. {{BOWLER}} errs down leg, sits up for {{BATSMAN}} on the hips and he whips it away past short fine leg. He beats deep backward square too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, high full toss outside off and {{BATSMAN}} can't put bat on it. Poor Parthiv Patel has no chance as the ball bounces in front of him and races away to the fence. {{BATSMAN}} asks for a possible no-ball but gets nothing from the umpires. It was around waist high and might have been given on another day\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and a boundary to finish.. {{BOWLER}} does not want to pitch it on a length, so he errs on the shorter side, {{BATSMAN}} is waiting for it and flays the cut behind square - bisecting backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is not happy with the effort by Gowtham. Should've stopped definitely. {{BATSMAN}} whacked it wide of long-on, Gowtham gets across, puts in the dive but doesn't stop it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, backs away and clubs this one cross-batted to the long-off boundary for four! Good start for {{BATSMAN}} here...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fullish and swinging away outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} stays in the crease and cuts hard, through cover-point and it races away for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, charges out to the pitch of the ball and smokes it down the ground. What a way to start from {{BATSMAN}}. Wow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, wrong 'un. {{BATSMAN}} tries the sweep, without reading the turn on it. The ball turns away to beat the bat, ricochets off the outer part of his torso\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, make that two in a row! This one's slightly wide of extra cover but {{BATSMAN}} has timed the punch-drive to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, floaty half-volley on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} needs no second invitation, gets inside the line and flicks it behind square on the on-side - almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} latches on anything loose, he absolutely does. It was a fuller length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches for it and slams the drive over point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a hat-trick of boundaries! Backs away into the on-side, and flays this inside out over the in-field to the deep extra cover boundary for four! {{TEAM}} needed this - the activation energy for something exothermic to begin\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a gift and {{BATSMAN}} ain't missing out. Loopy full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} does not do anything fancy, uses his power to drive it past extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not sure what {{BOWLER}} is appealing for? Clearly off the bat as {{BATSMAN}} reverse-swept and got a bottom edge, also {{BATSMAN}} had got outsi{{BATSMAN}} the line when playing the shot, beats short third and it raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, is greeted to the crease with a boundary. Flighted on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets and sweeps. Gets it more off the top-edge but it sails over behind square. No-one there and they'll collect a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's into the fun zone. {{BOWLER}} gives out another short one well down leg and Surya heaves it further. A tickle would've done here, but no, he'll do a carnage\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 4 wides, that's just bonus runs. Down the leg-side, turning away further and even Dhoni fails to get across in time. Desperate effort from Harbhajan to save the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR .. and again. {{BOWLER}} feeds it in the slog, and {{BATSMAN}} slog-sweeps, more into cow corner though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, 138.7kph, sharp bumper first up, {{BATSMAN}} is beaten - courtesy pacy and bounce. He is in no control to pull and misses it comfortably. Fies over the keeper's leap too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and now {{BOWLER}} overcompensates with the drag down. {{BATSMAN}} rocks behind, pumping the pull over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length, spinning away from off, {{BATSMAN}} steps back and punches it through the covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another leg break, {{BATSMAN}} waits and waits before dabbing that just wide of the keeper. Boundary through third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this was more streaky and {{BATSMAN}} won't mind. Hat-trick of fours. Quick and skidded through, {{BATSMAN}} was stuck on the back foot, looked to work it to the leg-side. Ends up squirting it more off the inner half and it eludes short fine leg, who's chase is vain in the end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now then, this is too much from CSK! Yes, the ball is swinging away, but you can't have such a big Test-match kind of gap at cover in a T20 game and this isn't the red ball which moves better. Fullish and outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} easily drives and picks up a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he has to hit them out now. Sees the width and slashes it through backward point.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's the width and there's the slash to follow that. Bullets away. The length was perfect to be hit. Shortish and angling away, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and cuts it fiercely through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is excellent cricket, the wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}}, pitched well outside off and spun away, {{BATSMAN}} waited for the ball to do its bit, arched back and carved it over backward point, the fielder gave the chase, but the ball spun away past him and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another edge, another boundary. On a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard at it and gets an outside edge that makes it fly past the keeper. Even a dive by Buttler wouldn't have helped his cause\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that has to be the softest stroke played to get a four this IPL. Unreal actually. Too full and {{BATSMAN}} got forward before wristing it wide of a diving Southee at mid-on. Placed expertly and the ball kissed the turf along its way to the fence. Delightful from KW\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the extra delivery and a boundary conceded. That's what you call small margins in cricket. Misses the yorker and offers a low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} dinks it over extra cover and the timing is such that it beats long-off comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, outside edge and four! Opens the bat face to steer, the edge flies to the right of Kulkarni who dives belatdely\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky way to bring up a fine fifty! Shortish with good bounce from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} just waits and dabs it with an open face. Well wide of de Kock and quite fine to the third man fence. It's been a good knock so far from {{BATSMAN}} but he has lacked support\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, erratic and {{BATSMAN}} puts it away this time. {{BOWLER}} strayed on the pads once more with this pacy inswinger, the southpaw just had to get bat on it and he tickled it past the keeper. Fine leg was quite squarer and had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and uses his bat angle to slice it fine of third man. There's a desperate dive, but the timing was too good\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now he finds the gap. Similar delivery, {{BATSMAN}} thumps it between the bowler and Kohli. The ball bullets away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 114.1kph, slower full ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} gets down to swipe across the line, gets a fat top-edge and the ball runs away fine for a one-bounce four into the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short and begging to be hit. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and finds the gap between long-on and deep mid with a hard pull. Right into the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's adding salt to the wound. {{BOWLER}} drags the length back and {{BATSMAN}} is all over it, uses the depth of the crease to hammer the pull past the diving mid-wicket fielder, no one in the deep to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky and four, wide full-toss from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} was shaping for the drive, opened the face of the bat and the edge flies behind square on the off-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gorgeous. So pleasing to the eye. Watches the ball bull-eyed and extends his arms over the loft over mid-off. Pure timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully timed! Placement was spot on too. Got this wide of mid-on and well to the left of the deep mid-wicket fielder as well. A touch short around middle, skids off the deck and {{BATSMAN}} whips it away with strong wristwork. Nicely done by the skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half tracker and {{BATSMAN}} makes him pay. There was ample width as well, {{BATSMAN}} reached out and flayed the cut behind square on the off-side, no chance for the sweeper cover to get across\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good adjustment from {{BATSMAN}}. Seemed like he was early on this slower bouncer but then decided to just control it. Got it wide of short fine leg and that was enough. Brings up the 50 as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, awkwardly for Warner and he can't stop it. A high full toss, swung away by {{BATSMAN}}, bounces just in front of his body and he can't even get a hand on that. Slips away from his grasp\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is a super quick outfield, flatter and on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, nudged away behind square on the on-side. Two men gave chase, but the ball kept going away from their reach\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drifting down leg, {{BATSMAN}} picks the line up quickly, gets down low and paddles it on its way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, looks to tuck a length ball in the air over mid-wicket, gets a thick leading edge which lobs up and rolls towards third man. Sandeep Sharma tried his best, but he ended up parrying the ball into the boundary boards\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, biffed! Watch out, Narine. A short of length delivery at 139kph, {{BATSMAN}} pummells the straight-pull over a ducking Narine at the non-striker's end. No chance for mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now the cheekiness. How smart is {{BATSMAN}} here? Nothing wrong with the delivery from {{BOWLER}}, it was flighted delivery just outside off but KJ cleverly went deep in his crease and opened his bat face at the last moment to guide it past short third man. The fielder gave a long chase but the ball wins the race\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is the {{BATSMAN}} of old. Put the bowler under pressure and then toy with him. {{BOWLER}} went short with his length after being hit over his head, {{BATSMAN}} waits and back cuts it behind point - bisecting backward point and short third man expertly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this isn't intentional, but it's useful. Length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} had charged down looking to biff no matter what. So it doesn't matter to him that the ball's far away. He throws his hands at it, and ends up slicing it off the outside half over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first one of the innings for {{BATSMAN}}. This was short and wide outside off and was meant to be put away. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out, reaches for it and thrashes it away, beats sweeper cover quite comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picked off his hips for six, is it? No, one bounce. So stylishly done. Loose from {{BOWLER}} again, he bowls back of a length and bowls leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} languidly swivels outside the line and helps it on its way. Lovely wrists\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, was that another chance? Looked like Nitish Rana got a fingertip to it and would be called a dropped chance. Fullish and angled across outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} squre-drives on the rise, the man at backward point moved to his left and tried to reverse-cup the ball but couldn't hold on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, only he can execute this shot with so much success. Sits down and moves across even before the ball has come out of the bowler's hand. It is a slower {{BATSMAN}}livery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} waits and pulls over short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, makes room while clearing his front leg and bludgeons Sreenath {{BOWLER}} straight down the ground. Can't slot fielders for that kind of a shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, fraction too short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room, waits on it and then slices the cut past the reach of Munro at backward point - much needed boundary for the Sunrisers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, slower ball goes all awry for {{BOWLER}}. Ends up as a waist-high full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was making room and connects with the slash. Sending it over point and free-hit beckons for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Those magical wrists of {{BATSMAN}} coming into play. Went back upon seeing this darter on leg, just swatted it across the line through square leg and pierces the gap to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, similar ball into the pads, this time he just helps it away through the gap between short fine and backward square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good use of the feet. {{BATSMAN}} puts on the dancing shoes and gets close to the flighted delivery, then muscles the drive straight of long-on, where Russell's dive is an after thought\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a dropped catch and then the MI's best bowler has been carted away for four next ball. Five runs off 2 balls and the asking rate is only around 9. Short of a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} pulls powerfully and there's no one at deep square leg to stop the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! Away-angler at 136.4kph, {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink and gets a thick outside edge that runs away through the gap between the keeper and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there wasn't any room there, not much pace either - some 124 odd kays - but the trick was in playing late. {{BATSMAN}} does that. Plays close to his body, opens the bat face and steers a boundary behind the dive of short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets loop, gets room, gets turn too. And AB {{BATSMAN}}ci{{BATSMAN}}s to help it along .. stepping forward a touch and lofting it insi{{BATSMAN}}-out over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, on the dance down, flings his hands out and slices. Can't keep it down. And Siraj running in from third man can't keep it in. Misjudges his dive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} responds by coming down the track, he reaches the line of ball and lofts it over cover for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, really poor delivery from {{BOWLER}}. He strays in line, tosses it up on leg stump and all {{BATSMAN}} does is paddle him away fine into the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, risky but four, pushed through flatter and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} backed away, exposed his stumps and gets a thick edge on the cut, rolls away past Kohli at slip and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swings hard and gets a boundary. Poor delivery as well from {{BOWLER}}. A short ball, {{BATSMAN}} slightly crouches and swishes it through mid-wicket. There is no protection there and {{BATSMAN}} is away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary of the final, {{BOWLER}} offers a freebie, it was a half-volley outside off. {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and squeezes it behind square on the off-side, beats backward point and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, for a second, {{BOWLER}} thought that he had flummoxed the batsman with his googly but {{BATSMAN}} made incredible adjustment despite not reaching the pitch. Throws his hand fully and blasts it past the non-striker. Nobody is stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, kills the game off, surely. Tremendous batting from {{BATSMAN}} Sharma. He picks the bowler's mind, reads the incoming yorker and sweeps it away through backward square. Raises a fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} joins in the fun now and {{BOWLER}} is getting a severe beating here. Misses the yorker anmd gives a low full toss, {{BATSMAN}} is already across the stumps and wrists it away powerfully wide of the long-on fielder. Nicely done\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fortune for {{BATSMAN}} but he won't mind as long as the runs keep coming. Wanted to heave this away but got deceived by the slower ball and got an inside edge onto the pad. Trickled past leg stump and went very fine down the leg-side to the fence. Handy for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss outside off, 144kph, {{BATSMAN}} carves it away through backward point. Rocketed off his bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and it flies between keeper and slip! {{BATSMAN}} pokes at this pacy good length delivery and the edge flies past the diving right hand of Pant. The slip was a little late to dive to his left, but its well past him before he could react\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is turning out to be an expensive over from {{BOWLER}}, dropped this one short and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it and then reverse laps it past the lone slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hammered! He is putting on a show here. Keeps moving around in the crease, makes room as the ball is delivered and drives it with his weight on the back leg, pierces the gap between extra cover and mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flies off the outside edge past short third man, no chance for the fielder who was inside the ring. He just threw his hands at the slightest amount of width that {{BOWLER}} had provided\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, looks a belter of a wicket this one. Just look at the timing on that. Minimum effort, maximum result. Was swinging into the batsman this full length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} creams it past the fielder at cover-point. {{BATSMAN}} has scored six boundaries and a six, Narine none\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a horror delivery from {{BOWLER}}. Slips it down leg, too easy for {{BATSMAN}} as he bends low and sweeps it very fine, earns himself a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now he's managed to get under a very full ball. The trick was in not reaching out for the ball. Stayed put, lifted the ball and got it over wide mid-on. Good shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! Spears a full delivery at 147.6ks and Mo squirts a thick inside edge through his legs, the placement is such that he splits fine leg and deep square leg perfectly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, two fours out of two. Clears the front leg and scythes this full-wide delivery to the left of sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, leading edge and it balloons over short third man. Got to feel for the bowler, set him up really well. Good length delivery, seaming in and just straightens off the pitch. {{BATSMAN}} was aiming for an across-the-hoick and lost his shape. Thick edge and gets away fortunately as it soars over the fielder's head before rolling away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh that's a fantastic shot! Tries backing away towards the on-side initially, then steps across shaping up to scoop, and then moves back again, only to steer that back of a length slower delivery in the channel late, with an open face, wide of backward point towards the deep backward point fence for four to finish off the innings...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not the best effort from Tahir in the deep, lets the ball sneak through for four. He's immediately removed from that position. Good length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get all of it but does enough to carve it away through sweeper cover's dive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, full and well outside off, right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} as he drives it past cover, the fielder in the deep has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the pressure is released with a low full toss. {{BOWLER}} went for the yorker and did not get it right, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it past the mid-wicket fielder and once it passes the inner ring, there is no stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pace on the ball from {{BOWLER}} and he's been put away. That's not how Thakur and Unadkat were bowling. It skids on nicely from a back of a length for {{BATSMAN}} and he flays it through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and effective. Makes a bit of room to this shortish ball that was going across him, guides it over the slip fielder, who is fairly wide. Third man too is in the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's an awful ball from {{BOWLER}}. Offers width, by bowling it well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in his crease and carves it over point. 50-run stand comes up between the two\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, those trunk-like forearms take over. {{BOWLER}} tosses outside off and {{BATSMAN}} drives with the turn. Places it wide of sweeper whose dive makes contact with the ball but fails to keep that in. First boundary for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is looking in good touch today! Intent in his gameplay. This was short and wide outside off, the opener makes use of the width on offer and thrashes it past the man at cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, chips down the track, converts it into a pitched up delivery and smokes it down the ground for a four. He has been finding gaps at ease tonight. That was the googly from {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, would have been a wide if {{BATSMAN}} left this but he chooses to go after it. Didn't time it well enough, still clears the infield on the off-side comfortably. Shorter length slower ball that was lifted over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, each and every run will hurt Uthappa. A short of a length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out for it and punches it through covers as he beats the fielder's dive inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, looks like go big or go home for {{TEAM}}. That seems to be the philosophy for them. {{BATSMAN}} gets into business rightaway. Flashes his bat at this away-swinger, the bat face turns at the point of contact but he manages to clear the in-field on the off-side. Opens his account with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cuts and cuts well does Hashim {{BATSMAN}}. Stays deep inside the crease and rotates his wrists through a fierce cut, beating a diving backward point to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes inside-out and cannons the ball over cover for a boundary. That was a full ball outside off and the batsman thwacks the ball over the fielder to get another boundary. Even {{BATSMAN}} joins in the act\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is on the charge! Creating some momentum for {{TEAM}} but he has to bat deep. This is a yorker attempt gone wrong from {{BOWLER}}, a full toss and it's whipped away through the big gap at square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow. That sped off the bat. {{BATSMAN}} breaks the shackles, stands tall and extends his hands into fierce punch, right off the middle and pistols away to the fence beating the sweeper cover fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy peasy. Can't bowl on the legs of any batsman. {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across to get inside the line, helps it along the way past the man at 45. Off the mark with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, three in a row. Problems aplenty for {{BOWLER}}. Just not getting his line right. Slants it on the pads, fine leg was inside the ring and {{BATSMAN}} will put it away seven days a week and twenty four hours a day. Flicks it past short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 'catch it' cries {{BOWLER}}, but {{BATSMAN}} has got enough wood on that. {{BOWLER}} saw the batter back away and fired on following him. {{BATSMAN}} toe-ends the drill over and wide of mid-off. Uppish, but safe\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, some runs scrapped here. In style rather. Those wrists employed in executing the lofted drive over extra cover. Finding the gap to perfection. {{BOWLER}} for some reason doesn't believe in not dishing out half volleys at this stage of the game\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 138.1km/h, a full-blooded drive through the vacant extra cover region! A good length delivery in the zone, angling in, and not much wrong with it, {{BATSMAN}} takes a small step forward and drives it through the line towards the deep extra cover fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misses the blockhole. Just the shot {{BATSMAN}} needed to help himself to his first runs. A low full toss on the pads and whipped away with those enviable wrists. The deep square boundary takes the impact\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries. Follows up the full delivery with a short one, {{BATSMAN}} is on one leg to pull it away behind square leg. The man was inside the ring and there was no one stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four to end the over! 142.7kph, very full and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and superbly slices it over backward point. Pattinson runs to his right in the deep, but puts in a lousy effort to stop that. {{BOWLER}} wears a cheeky smile on his face, sure he didn't like it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, walking swat, utterly outrageous. {{BATSMAN}} - clearly with no respect - walks down the pitch and then rocks onto the front foot to pull it so damn neatly to bisect deep mid-wicket and long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overcooked on the legs. And {{BATSMAN}} owns him, all bottom-hand in this whippy on-drive. He knows there's no long-on, and he bisects the ones inside the ring to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant from {{BATSMAN}}. These might be crucial runs. Could well be match-winning. This 10-odd runs he has managed in the last over. Wide length ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} reached out and cut between the two men in the ring on the off-side. No-one sweeping out there and {{TEAM}} end with 205\n",
            "San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that was a poor piece of fielding from the man at third man. So {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark straightaway in this IPL. San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} bowled a {{BATSMAN}}cent length ball outsi{{BATSMAN}} off stump, just shaped away from the right-han{{BATSMAN}}r, {{BATSMAN}} gui{{BATSMAN}}d that with an angled bat past point and eventually managed to get a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is on fire here. Remember he is playing against his old franchise. Length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} swings through the line, not off the middle but goes straight and collects a one bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now on the other side of the ground. {{BOWLER}} needs to stick to one plan. Short and on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} didn't go hard on the pull, just relied on placing it fine and pocketing a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hat-trick of slower balls and so predictable. {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and lofts over and wide of mid-off. So easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is deceived for a while, in the flight. But does well to go with the shot and hits it well enough to beat the dive from long-off to his right. Eventually timed it really well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} welcomes him with a thumping drive. Bit of air and {{BATSMAN}} plants his front foot forward, smashed it straight back over the bowler's head. Didn't bother to run, he knew he had middled it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played! This was a back of a length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, uses the pace on the ball and dabbed it behind square on the off-side. Backward point dived to his left, short third man to his right - but both can't stop the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, steers another yorker to the third man boundary. Mumbai looking absolutely clueless. Rohit claps for his bowler who's hardly faltered with his execution, but that's hardly much consolation for {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, placed! Well placed! This is what Delhi were lacking. It is a short ball and {{BATSMAN}} rolls his wrists on the pull to bisect the fielders converging from deep backward square leg and deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clears his front leg and lays the finishing marker on the game. AB at mid-on slides to his left, but realizes that's too far to fetch. So, Dinesh Karthik and {{TEAM}} start off their campaign in style, a morale-boosting 4-wicket win over RCB. A typical slog from {{BATSMAN}}, all he needed to do was clear mid-off and boy did he hit that hard! Comfortably past mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, much needed boundary for {{TEAM}}. Banged in short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across and helps it on its way, beats short fine and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is relieving some pressure off {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}}. Length ball on his pads, {{BATSMAN}} gleefully puts it away behind square on the on-side. It went in the air - but well wide of Unadkat at short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just a mere extension of the punch. Played it with leaden-feet and timed it to perfection, waited for the full ball to dip and graced it with touch of elegance. Back over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, floated full on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} sits up and brooms it away with sheer disdain, rocketed away behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, why do you bowl that? Easy runs on offer for {{BATSMAN}} and he gets off the mark with a delightful stroke. Quicker and overpitched outside off, Yuvi plants his front leg forward and middles the drive. No chance for long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not where {{BATSMAN}} wanted it to go but he will take it with both hands at this stage of the innings. It was on a fuller length and was attacking the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swings his willow hard. He gets a thick inside edge and it beats short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dances down the track, picks up the googly and hoicks the ball away through mid-wicket and long-on for a four. {{TEAM}} will take it, with open arms\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short balls have had a history of troubling {{BATSMAN}}, true, but not at 118kph. Muscles this pull well in front of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brings out the broom. Spots the length, the friendly one and without bothering to read the turn this time sweeps it powerfully through square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very wide outside off and {{BATSMAN}} somehow reaches out and then generates enough power to carve it over extra-cover. He's in a hurry now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, streaky but {{BATSMAN}} will take it. On a good length and holding its line outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to drive, the late wobble takes the edge and rolls away through the vacant slip region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, backs away, receives one that is pounded in on short of length and slaps it over cover. Some form these blokes are carrying, and the confidence is on show\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the boundaries are flowing for {{TEAM}}, fraction short and sliding down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} went half-way down and pulled it behind square on the on-side, the man in the deep was square and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor bowling. Offers width outside off and {{BATSMAN}} places it expertly, he waits for the ball to arrive and steers it behind point - between short third man and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, delicate. The quicker offie and {{BATSMAN}} picked it alright, camped back in the crease and used the pace on the ball to direct it fine past short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third boundary of the over, slower and shorter of off, {{BATSMAN}} bends down low and places it into the vacant gap at deep mid-wicket, split the two men in the deep to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot. Waited for the ball to turn away and then {{BATSMAN}}layed the shot to send it wi{{BATSMAN}} of point, sweeper had too much distance to cover and the ball beat him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more. {{BOWLER}} darts it outside off, {{BATSMAN}} crouches low and bludgeons it over extra cover. No chance for the men in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another drag down, and {{BATSMAN}} makes it worse with his camp deep in the crease. And the uses the width outside off to carve it away behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty partnership! {{BOWLER}} over-corrects and bowls this too short, easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}. Pulled away through mid-wicket for yet another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, breaks the shackles in style! Swung across the line for a four. That was in the arc for {{BATSMAN}} to thwack it through the square leg region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wide full toss outside off and it's been sliced over cover-point. What a knock this is proving to be. If KKR had Russell, {{TEAM}} got {{BATSMAN}}. Two of the cleanest strikers of the cricket ball playing this match\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a buffet ball from Krishna. Sends a length delivery down leg, easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}} as he gently shuffles across and helps it very fine. Fine leg was inside the ring and just watched the ball elude to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is a brave hit and well executed too. Flighted delivery wide outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} was down on one knee and he had to fetch that shot, extended his arms and slog-swept it nicely into the deep mid-wicket boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, when you can hit on the up in that manner than deduce it's a belter of a wicket to bat on. {{BATSMAN}} charges forward, transforms the length into a fuller one and just eases it through cover. The timing was stellar and it raced off the bat and reached the fence in some micro seconds!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the partnership between {{BATSMAN}} and Eoin Morgan is now 50. Short ball, flatter in trajectory and the batsman stays back to cut it away between short third man and point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good length ball outside off, tentative footwork from {{BATSMAN}}. But it doesn't cost him. Instead, he benefits. The loose poke results in an outside edge which runs away fine to the third man boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, loopy dip, but {{BATSMAN}}'s just too smart. He runs down, maybe yorking himself in the process, but why bother when you have bottom-hands as good as these .. drills it straight down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, drives it on the up and beats the diving fielder at cover, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Pant was flying in air like David De Gea, he gets a hand on it but fails to grab the catch. It was short of length delivery down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} gets some bat to it on the pull and ball goes just wide and to the left of the keeper for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh glorious. As clean as it could get. A pitched up delivery in the arc and {{BATSMAN}} gives his top order a facepalm moment with a full bat face presentation. Whizzes past the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, vintage {{BATSMAN}}! Tossed up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out, gets to the pitch of it, and lofts that inside-out over extra cover for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length at the body, {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes aren't on the ball all the way through, but he's controlled the pull nicely behind square. And the timing is brilliant, even though he's checked the shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is winning this battle against his state mate. Once again he picks the length so early, swivels deep in the crease and pulls to deep mid-wicket, beating the fielder comfortably to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed straight down the ground, can Kohli get there? He can but in trying to pull it back, doesn't deflect it back inside the playing area. It was too full and {{BATSMAN}} knelt down to hit that back over the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, belted, {{BOWLER}} got a hand onto it, but such was the fierceness of the shot - he could only get a hand onto it - tossed up on middle, {{BATSMAN}} pressed forward and drilled it back at the bowler, will go down as a half-chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is a brilliant shot. Not a bad ball at all for the field set. Fullish and outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and punches it with an angled bat, splits backward point and cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third successive delivery straying on the pads, the length was short, so it won't swing, {{BATSMAN}} pulls, can't tell he controlled that but he placed it well wide of the man at square leg/widish mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} has his hands on his head. He shouted \"catch it,\" but it was nowhere close to the fiel{{BATSMAN}}r. Slower back of a length {{BATSMAN}}livery, {{BATSMAN}} punched it on the up and in the air, wi{{BATSMAN}} of extra cover and sweeper though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it is all going {{BATSMAN}}'s way. He might walk on water today if he wants and get away with it. A well-directed yorker, {{BATSMAN}} brings his bat down and squirts it off the inside edge to the fine leg fence. Not far away from the leg-pole\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, expensive over from {{BOWLER}}, short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, rolls his wrists and bisects the two men in the deep on the on-side, rolls away to the fence in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length outside off, guides it with an open face between backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, that should get him going, fraction short and wide of off, he leans forward, plays with a flat-bat and gets it in the gap - wide of extra-cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a cracking shot to get off the mark! That was a gift from {{BOWLER}}. Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, clears the front leg and slaps it hard over covers. One bounce and over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's fortuitous for {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} fires it in, {{BATSMAN}} was setting up for a wild slog and goes hard. It cuts him for room and the batsman gets a thick inside edge which shaves the leg-stump and runs away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now he's back to his caresses. More like the {{BATSMAN}} we know. Moves away, exposes his stumps and {{BOWLER}} tries his best to evade the reach with a wide yorker. Gets under it and shows the full bat face in lofting it over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, {{TEAM}} will take these runs, length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swung across the line, gets a big edge that flies through the vacant first slip region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, geez! That is some shot. Pitched up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't move his feet much but just drives through the line, the weight going back and the hands moving towards the ball. Nobody moved in the field as the ball rocketed past mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball, {{BATSMAN}} stays back and punches uppishly off the back foot. Bit of a slice, which is why he isn't in control, and interestingly gets it over the man at mid-on who was running back. Jofra Archer tried to fetch it back but the ball dropped in front of him and spun into the boundary ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that spoils the over. Not a bad ball by any means. Banged one short and generated good lift, {{BATSMAN}} is late on the pull, off the glove and well wide of MS. Runs away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's poor planning. He goes short with square leg and fine leg inside the ring, even the mistimed pull from {{BATSMAN}} races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, eye-pleasing! Back of a length wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets into to perfect position as he punches the ball on the up through the covers, blazed away...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full and gets slammed! Right in the swinging arc for {{BATSMAN}} who times the pants of a flashy drive and gets it in the gap through covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first ball from {{BOWLER}} and it is smashed for four. Short, wide and {{BATSMAN}} had the width to free his arms, slaps it behind point and third man had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, they have been trying to bowl wide of off to {{BATSMAN}} and he smartly targets the cover region with a nice lofted hit, just bounced inside the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four. {{BOWLER}} is not happy. Throws a wild stare at the batsman. On a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went hard at it, gets an outside edge that races away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's lovely placement. No one at third man, he was actually inside the ring, so any width from the bowler is going to be easy, {{BATSMAN}} opened the bat face and nicely guided it past the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, such an artist! This was darted around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it to arrive and heaves it into the huge gap at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a freebie! A 91kph, short-and-wide ball, cut hard to the left of backward point. Raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and smashed! {{BATSMAN}} picked the length early there, the line was there to help him too. Just swivels and belts the pull backwards of square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR leg-byes, {{TEAM}} are through to their 8th final in 10 editions they have played! A short one that's angling down leg, {{BATSMAN}} whips it away off the backfoot (off the pads in fact) past a desperately-diving Pant towards the fine leg fence for four - and there are hugs in the changing room already. {{TEAM}} are through to another final - surprise, surprise!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 16 runs off the over! Another glorious shot. Bottom hand power. Shimmies down the track, converts into a half-vollet and {{BATSMAN}} drove it exquisitely through extra cover. All along the carpet and into the fence. 82/0 after 8 overs!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flat one angled into middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets low and swats a sweep away to backward square leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, successive boundaries for the Englishman. This was on his pads and {{BATSMAN}} flicks it wristily over square leg. Very VVS-esque shot that and it's four more for the opener\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, anti-climactic end to a superb effort. Put in a pool like dive at {{BOWLER}}ep mid to get to it. But then kept sliding and the ball slipped away. Just touched the ropes and their was dismay on the face of the skipper. The short ball was thumped away between mid-wicket and long-on by the batsman\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, down the track to drill this hard wide of short cover, Dre Russ slides and stops the ball, but was his back foot in touch with the rope when he was in contact with the ball? Third umpire checks, four it is\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, chipped over a leaping extra cover! {{BATSMAN}} was a bit in two minds as he played this, almost as an afterthought but did well to clear the infield eventually. Was looped wider outside off, and {{BATSMAN}} didn't really get to the pitch but went through with the stroke. Picked his gap well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's that. A juicy length delivery right in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} swings it over mid-on. Trickling away into the fence with the field brought up. Applies the finishing touches in style. {{TEAM}} plant their flag again to reclaim the fortress\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh risky but it's come off for {{BATSMAN}}. Preempts, gets down low and paddles it. Nutmegs Dhoni and runs away to the fine leg fence. It skimmed the under-edge but it's DK's pet shot, so he earns a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he is looking to play aggressively and maximise the powerplay. This is tossed up outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and slog-sweeps over mid-wicket, one bounce over the ropes. Lovely batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smacks a wide full ball, flat-batted, wide of Smith's one-handed leap at mid-off. Good aggressive shot that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another juicy full toss. Oh dear. Oh dear. Flat-batted, heaving it downtown. Oh the bleeding, it's getting painful to watch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that might be the commentators curse. {{BOWLER}} missed the yorker by a few yards, low full toss on middle, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it to the fine leg fence. The fast outfield on display again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overpitched and {{BATSMAN}} puts it away. {{BOWLER}} overcooks the flighted delivery and offers width as well, {{BATSMAN}} bends his back knee and creams the drive through extra cover. He did well to pierce the crowded field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, loosener from {{BOWLER}}. Rank long hop on off, {{BATSMAN}} had all the time in the world to go deep in the crease and pull it in front of square, wide of deep mid-wicket and {{BATSMAN}} is getting a move on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, inhuman this fella is. Really. How hard and flat has he hit that. To a short rising delivery into the body. He just has smashed the leather off the ball and gave deep square no chance. Muscled that with sheer force\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, more runs for {{BATSMAN}}, more frustration for {{BOWLER}}. This the slower ball on off, {{BATSMAN}} was perhaps looking to play with an open face, he didn't look to get it that fine though, past the keeper and third man was inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, makes rom to a well flighted delivery, gets down on his knee and goes inside out over cover-point, a few bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, you mind-reader {{BATSMAN}}. Knows he's going to get it full, so moves away, gives room and with a measure of mid-off in the circle, goes inside-out in his lofted drive over. So very easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundary to end the over. Short one on the pads and all {{BATSMAN}} has to do is help it on its way. Does so and drags it past the fielder at short fine leg, finds the fence and moves on to 28* with that, was the knuckle ball and {{BATSMAN}} picked it up nicely\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} oversteps and bowls a length ball on middle and leg. {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and tucks it very fine. The short fine leg fielder is pretty fine as well. Free-hit coming up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed! This is the length that {{BATSMAN}} enjoys a lot. Shorter from {{BOWLER}} and it's been dispatched with a nonchalant pull through square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too easy! Drifting down leg on a length and all {{BATSMAN}} had to do help it on its way, he sits on one knee and scoops it fine of the keeper to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, that should release some pressure off {{BATSMAN}}, comes down the track, flat-bats the short of a length delivery and lifts it back over {{BOWLER}}'s head, a few bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a good comeback from {{BATSMAN}}, tossed up on the stumps, he gets down low and sweeps it over square leg, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more! Drags the length back and bowls a slower one outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes after it with hard hands and gets an outside edge. Eludes the man at short third man and gets back-to-back boundaries\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, follows the edges with one off the meat. A half volley and sends it on a leather hunt with a spank through the covers. Bangalore touch 160\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a dart at 99.8kph wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat at it and slashes it through backward point. 15 off the over with two balls to go\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Brilliant use of the crease. It was the quick ball - 113.4kph - {{BATSMAN}} made room and lifted it inside-out over extra cover for a one-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} missed the yorker by a yard or so and that was just what {{BATSMAN}} wanted with the line being middle and leg. He waited for the ball to come and flicked it past the diving mid-wicket fiel{{BATSMAN}}r\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rubs in some more elegance. Clears his back leg, reads the flight, reads the googly and inside-outs it over extra cover. Oh Kolkata need the breather .. time-out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another hit-me on leg-stump, all {{BATSMAN}} needed to do was get some bat on that; he spots the line early and manages enough contact to clip that fine for a boundary. A wicket a three fours, an eventful over comes to an end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, time for the {{BATSMAN}} show! Goes down on his knee and scoops the length delivery over fine leg. The fielder was inside the circle and the opener clears him comfortably. That almost went the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh boy. He's toying around with the bowling out here. {{BOWLER}} looks to go wide outside off with the shortened length as well. But {{BATSMAN}} in all his confidence walks across, crouches and half-pulls, half-sweeps it past the reach of the man at 45-degrees behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky, but {{TEAM}} will take it. It was a good over from {{BOWLER}}. Full, fast and slanting into the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} heaves across the line and the inside edge eludes a diving Sanju Samson\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good shot! The {{TEAM}} skipper shimmies down the track, gets close to the pitch of this quicker ball and chips it over wide mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first four of the innings. Beats the five men on the off-side with a cracking cut. The width was there and he pounced on that beating a diving cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's asking for trouble. Short and way outside off stump, the arm-ball gone wrong, maybe the newish ball slipped out of his hands, {{BATSMAN}} had to reach out and he cut that fiercely past point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, front foot no ball and it's safe to say that the game has just started. Batting game I meant. {{BATSMAN}} backed away as he got width on the off-side and absolutely spanked the drive with full face past the diving left hand of backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! Not where he intended, but when luck is on your side, everything goes your way. {{BOWLER}} comes round the wicket and cramps {{BATSMAN}} for room, he attempts a cut shot and the outside edge runs away to the right of Buttler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant timing! Low full toss wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and slices it past backward point. It skimmed off the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one ball per over he will bowl short. Or else he can't bowl. That's {{BOWLER}} for you. This short ball doesn't rise enough to trouble {{BATSMAN}} who rolls his wrists on the swivel-pull and beats deep square to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is excellent cricket from {{BATSMAN}}, made room as he came down the track. {{BOWLER}} spotted it and followed him - {{BATSMAN}} is good enough to tuck it past square leg, the man in the deep is very square and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, whipped, length delivery on the leg-stumnp line, {{BATSMAN}} makes room, gets his left leg out of the way and flicks it wristily past mid-wicket, off the mark with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is an awful effort from Narine. Makes a royal mess of this one. {{BOWLER}} wears a cheeky smile on his face. It was a short ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets a top-edge as he tried to elevate it over third man. The ball lobs in the air and drops in front of Narine at third man, he fails to get his body behind the line of the ball and lets it go through making him look absolute silly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just the hint of width. Enough for {{BATSMAN}} to sniff a boundary out of it. Throws the kitchen sink at it with a crack through the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, creamed, width on offer from Shardul, {{BATSMAN}} leans into the shot and drives it to the left of extra-cover. It was in the air but was perfectly placed as well, no chance for the fielder at mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, carrom ball, but the length is short, {{BATSMAN}} muscles the pull through mid-wicket. Tye moves to his left from long-on, but is lethargic to bend low\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, didn't time it well, but manages to fetch a boundary. This was bowled fuller and {{BATSMAN}} went hard on the drive. He probably wanted to go through mid-off and got it off the inside edge. Beats mid-on by a long way and once it beat him, the quick outfield did the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half a step, but full hands. Gets the back leg out, whippy wrists and drills it away through the covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and the equation is down to 17 off 4 balls! A tossed up delivery by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} has smashed it right past the bowler, it's four more..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has had enough. Opens his stance, knew what was coming and blasted it hard. Lost his timing and shape, dragged it off the toe-end and it beats mid-off. Long-on does his best but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he is playing around with the field here. {{BATSMAN}} is on a roll. He is expecting the short ball and swivels to pull this wide of the man at short fine leg. {{BATSMAN}} is motoring along here. DD need to somehow stop him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! What power! This was close to yorker length, but {{BATSMAN}} used the depth of the crease nicely, went deep to get underneath it and hammered it over extra cover. There was a fielder in the deep but he had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} already looks in his element. Slower short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} picked the length so early, short-arm jabs the pull over mid-wicket and it almost went the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky but DD won't mind. The slower delivery but had the space for {{BATSMAN}} to throw the kitchen sink, the outside edge flies fine and down to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 1000 runs for {{BATSMAN}} in IPL! Wide-ish delivery in the channel outside off, very close to tramline, {{BATSMAN}} gets down on his knee and smacks it over covers, one bounce and into the fence she goes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, this short-ball plan isn't working for MI, too short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it in front of square on the on-side, the man in the deep is too square and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky from {{BATSMAN}}. He is taking his side over the line for sure. It was on a length and there was just a bit of room, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it to arrive, opens the face of the bat at the very last moment and guides it fine of third man who had no chance to stop it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bursts through the hands. {{BOWLER}}'s. Was a polite drill down this squeezing out the fuller one from {{BATSMAN}} as he smashes it back. The bowler, slow to get low has a boundary against his name\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's some helicopter in this one, piling on the low full toss and whipping it into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged but just eludes Gayle's outstretched right-hand. {{BOWLER}} gains trampoline bounce outside off with this back of a length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} pokes with hard hands and outside-edges it towards Gayle, who was at a widish slip. Gingerly stretched his right hand but it escaped away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, perfect cover drill -- big plonk in front, leaning through the line, still head, high elbows and the fullest of bat-faces in bisecting the two men out there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just bowled a slower ball, tries to repeat, but this is well outside off stump and the batsman read this from the hand. No third man, so {{BATSMAN}} camps back and cuts past backward point. A 31-ball fifty for Watto, another very handy innings at the top\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, got it finer than he intended to but he won't mind. Flatter and closer to off, executes the late cut and it dribbles away off the outer half. Beats short third man easily and speeds to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 10 off 2 in this over. {{BOWLER}} has been belted for the first time in powerplay. He is clearly not used to it. And his response will be interesting to see. It was touch fuller of good length, {{BATSMAN}} picks up the length early and drives it like a boss. It beats cover and races to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good length delivery in the channel outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lets it come on, true bounce and no lateral movement, driven away on the up to deep extra cover for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, let the ball come onto him, used the pace on the ball and then nudged it behind square on the on-side, beat the man in the ring and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky from Kane! Moved right across the stumps and paddled that, didn't middle it, got a bit of an edge, but that was good enough, short fine leg had no chance. 200 up for Hyderabad\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, fraction overpitched and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to get forward and creams it into the wide gap at cover-point, no need to run for those and {{BATSMAN}} is off and running in style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Bhajji comes in, Bhajji is not going to be spared either. That was short again, hint of room and {{BATSMAN}} jumps onto the cut to spear it away past the man at point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, takes it from well outside off and sweeps it away squarer. That was off the inner half of the blade and made enough contact to speed away into the gap on the on-side. 49 needed. The game getting easier for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, on the up. And a dispatch. the strike rate is back to normalcy now. Stands up on the bounce, shows the full bat face and flays it through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, miscued but it was in the gap. Slower delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} is through the shot a bit early and ends up slicing it over extra cover, the ball has enough to beat a chasing Finch from long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, drops this one short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and cracks it over cover, couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes down and smashes the full toss over the deep mid-wicket ropes. Some nerves maybe from the Afghanistan leggie and {{BATSMAN}} pounced all over them with a mighty slog-sweep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, dropped it short and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} had plenty of time as he rocked back and pulled it wide of mid-wicket, even the big dive from Russell can't prevent the ball from hitting the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finishes the innings on a positive note. 19 runs off the over. {{BOWLER}} went for 39 in his final two overs. You have to get the yorker spot on against {{BATSMAN}}. Slightly off and he puts it away, the bat comes down like an axe and he lofts it over {{BOWLER}}, one bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picks the gap behind square, and nails. Opening his bat face and using the sheer pace that {{BOWLER}}'s dishing out all over to get it perfectly out there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fabulous whip off the pads. Drifting into middle, a length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} used his strong forearms to power it away, beats deep mid-wicket's desperate dive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, goes right through {{BATSMAN}}, but bounces over the stumps. That's beaten everyone. An absolute ripper from {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length but there's enough room outside off. {{BATSMAN}} makes some of his own and punches it behind point. Softly done\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, woah. {{BATSMAN}} > elegance. It's too full anyways and Sharma lays in with a stride getting to it in drilling a lofted drill straight into long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a real sitter. Quite a nothing delivery this from {{BOWLER}}. Neither full nor short enough. Gives {{BATSMAN}} all the time to open himself up and spot the area to place this angry pull of his. Decides it would be cow corner to take the brunt\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a wicket and 12 runs off the over! {{BOWLER}} slightly overpitches and {{BATSMAN}} took full toll of it. Bent forward and laced the drive wide of mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, errs in line and that is enough for {{BATSMAN}} to collect a boundary. On leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and uses {{BOWLER}}'s pace to glance it past the diving short fine fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully sliced wide of backward point's leap and that's been let through by Mujeeb, who's running across from third man. Covers the ground, slides but can't stop the ball. Was almost in control but then wasn't\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hat-trick of fours! Too straight on this occasion and {{BATSMAN}} tickles it to fine leg for another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, overpitched and on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, that's easy pickings for him, gets inside the line and clips it in front of square on the on-side, beats the fielder getting across from the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, third man was inside the ring and he went full and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reached out for the slice, gets a thick outside edge that cleared the man in the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and gets a short ball to his liking. Cuts over cover, a couple of bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, guided, in the air but in the gap between short third man and backward point. {{BATSMAN}} used pace on that short of length delivery really well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Kumar continues to struggle with his lines. Attempted pitched up {{BATSMAN}}livery, ends up in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} who makes merry. Hoicking it over wi{{BATSMAN}} long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} joins the party too. First off his firts ball. There was width on this delivery and {{BATSMAN}} cuts it over backward point and wide of third man for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is smart batting. Looked like the short slower delivery on the leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line, swivels and helps it away fine knowing fine leg is very square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, time for cliches, \"Fortune favours the brave\" chirps Laxman Sivaramakrishnan on air. Also, french cricket from {{BATSMAN}}, goes for the almighty pull, the ball shapes in a touch, takes the inside edge and beats a diving Saha, who sprawled to his right. Runs away to the fence in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} makes full use of the free-hit, he picks up the slower one early, gets himself in a good position and tonks it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary. This should get him going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh, poor Rashid. The ball's following him and this time he fails to stop it. Should have done better definitely because the standards he sets in the field is amazing. Shortish from {{BOWLER}}, well outside off. {{BATSMAN}} gets deep and cuts it past point. Rashid did cover good ground but ended up letting it away to the fence at sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sublime from {{BATSMAN}}! He's looking in great touch tonight, isn't he? Too full from {{BOWLER}} and it's been drop kicked over wide mid-on. Supple stuff and easily over the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and {{BATSMAN}} is exactly doing that. On a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} picks the length early and chips it over extra cover for a cracking four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hat-trick of fours here. Raining boundaries. {{BOWLER}} shifts his line outside off, {{BATSMAN}} with a bent knee reaches out and drills it over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a night to forget for Imran Tahir as he puts one down. Pick-up flick shot from {{BATSMAN}}, Tahir at fine leg was late to anticipate as he tries to reach the ball with a lackadaisical dive, through his fingers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another short ball and this time {{BATSMAN}} puts it away. No height or venom on this, {{BATSMAN}} is quickly into position and nails the pull over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and it races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, change of pace from {{BOWLER}}, it was the slower ball, but it was well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} leant forward and cracked the drive wide of mid-off, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rubbish from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} deals with it. Darted full and down leg, {{BATSMAN}} crouches low and helps it along the way past short fine. 100-run stand comes up with that boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, banged in halfway down and {{BOWLER}} does not have the pace to trouble the batsman, it sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} and he nails the pull in front of square, wide of long-on and though Pooran had just a few yards to cover, he was not able to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, connects this time and although it hasn't met the middle, {{BATSMAN}}'s muscled it in the gap between mid-on and mid-wicket to send it racing along to the turf\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 110.8kph, slow, short and wide. {{BATSMAN}} backs away and slaps it fiercely over extra cover. Couple of bounces and into the fence. Still a good over for Mumbai as they managed to nip out KW\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, doesn't nail the timing again but he's hit it with enough power to beat mid-on to his right. A full ball slanted in on off, {{BATSMAN}} shovels it away down the ground with a lot of bottom hand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a hit-me delivery. {{BOWLER}} shortens his length and there's not much pace or bounce to threaten the batter. {{BATSMAN}} gets into a strong position and pummels the pull in front of square on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, leg-stump half-volley from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} bends down low, uses {{BOWLER}}'s pace and laps it past the keeper, no need to run for those with fine-leg inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slow full toss and lofted over mid-on for the first four of the innings. That was a terrible delivery and {{BATSMAN}} took advantage of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the 180-degree opposite now. Drags the line from outside off, perfectly under the sweep to nail it through square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the gallops are out. Jumps down, goes away, frees his arms and rubs the pressure inducing salts on the comeback. A half volley to help himself and throws everything his hands have on it to carve it through the covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, width on the off-side to the right hander this time, {{BATSMAN}} has no second thoughts, he stays his ground and cuts fiercely square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor bowling from {{BOWLER}}. He misses the yorker and bowls a juicy full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} uses the pace and steers it to third man, no one there to stop the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 123.8kph, just a punch. First ball, eh. High elbows, standing up on the length delivery and stroking away through the line, through the covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boundary to finish the over. It was on a fuller length and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches for it and smokes it wide of long-on for a four. It raced off the bat!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor start from {{BOWLER}}. With third man and point inside the circle, he gives batsman the room outside off. {{BATSMAN}} waits for the ball and cuts it late to pick the gap perfectly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is a shot of a man in confidence. He picked the wrong 'un that was a tad overpitched and lofted it straight of mid-off, superb way to open your account\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classic shot by Kane. Another short delivery well outside off, looking the class of {{BATSMAN}} he won't miss out. Plays a perfect square cut and pierces the gap at cover-point to end the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flighted delivery down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in the crease and tucks it wide of the leg-slip, it beats short fine and will reach the boundary too. {{BATSMAN}} is on fire!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the idea was right from {{BOWLER}} - to opt for a fuller one as follow up for the bumper - the execution was poor. It's a full toss and {{BATSMAN}} slices the drive over cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} walks at {{BOWLER}} who bowls a slower ball on middle and leg. That's {{BATSMAN}}'s bread and butter shot. A beautiful wristy flick through mid-wicket fetches him another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! This is some hitting. Fullish and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} nonchalantly lofts it inside out over extra cover, the ball almost carried the distance. One bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brute force. Nipping away outside off, plenty of room to free his arms and {{BATSMAN}} seizes.. slapping it over extra cover with enviable timing!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not a great effort by Bumrah at short fine leg, he should have stopped this. Was down the leg side as {{BATSMAN}} swept it past the man at short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, all kinds of zig-zag, that run-up, a slower, wide length ball, {{BATSMAN}} delays the shot and then just cross-bats a slap to long-off for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deliberately goes up and over point. Ordinary delivery. Short of length with width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} opens his wrists up as he slashes it away to lift it over the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy to put away. Drifting down leg, all {{BATSMAN}} had to do was get a tickle, which he did. No chance for the man at 45 to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clears the infield! {{BATSMAN}}'s intentions very clear, he wants to kill the game in the Powerplay. Not really in the slot but he goes through with the chip shot down the ground. Easily over mid-on and it speeds to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} stretches out to reach it and then cuts it away to the point boundary. He's taking {{BOWLER}} apart\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} ain't happy with the fielder at fine leg. Was a short ball and {{BATSMAN}} it pulls it away as he beats the fielder in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, calculated risk from {{BATSMAN}}. First ball from a new bowler, mid-off inside the ring and {{BATSMAN}} was walking down the pitch, extends his arms and lifts it over the fielder, couple of bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, delicate hands from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} pulls his length and feeds him with width outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in his crease and opens his bat face at the last moment to place it in the gap past point. The timing is flawless and the sweeper in the deep had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, attempted slog sweep, is not really well timed but is well placed to send it away into the vacant backward square region for a much needed four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a lovely shot by Mayank! That's the kind of form he is in. Pitched up outside off and the right hander plays a gentle punch to pierce the field at covers, it's a rollicking boundary and the first one of the night for Punjab\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and profitable result for {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} wears a wry smile on his face. Slanted across outside off, lured {{BATSMAN}} into playing a false shot. Gets the outside edge and unfortunately for {{BOWLER}}, it flew past a diving DK to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misfielded by Maxwell at mid-on. Flat from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} wrists it away and basks in the glory of someone else's plight\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and what does he do now? Backs away, creates oodles of room and allows his hands to power it over cover for a four to deep extra. Again, the power and placement worked in tandem over there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, reverse sweep and four, flighted delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends down half-way and then gets it past the keeper, no chance for short third man and the ball rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} will take on {{BOWLER}} even with the long boundaries. Flighted outside off, {{BATSMAN}} is down on his knee and launches the slog sweep over mid-wicket, since it is a big side of the ground, the ball bounces inside the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too wide from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} punishes. Camps back and cuts it in the direction of the turn. Beats point and races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a poor ball to end the over, short and on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he gets insi{{BATSMAN}} the line and pulls it fine - past Archer's dive at short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} continues to offer width and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out this time. Short and wide at 136ks, {{BATSMAN}} frees his arms and flays it over point with disdain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for KL {{BATSMAN}}! His third in his last four games. Jumps out of his crease and hacks the flat delivery wide of long-on, Manish Pandey runs across and dives but couldn't only manage a fingertip on that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh Lungi! He's the old fit self that he is. The rhythm isn't there, the strides aren't intense. Full delivery, {{BATSMAN}} charges and slaps wide of mid-off. Can't be bowling full with mid-off in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} keeps fighting. He charges down the track while making enough room for himself to carve this short ball over cover. It was more of a slice, but he's still able to beat sweeper cover to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he has placed it to perfection! It was on a good length and was wi{{BATSMAN}} of off, {{BATSMAN}} opens the face of the bat at the very last moment and gui{{BATSMAN}}s it in between backward point and third man for a four! His third of the innings!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, fuller length delivery and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, head on top of the ball and then lets his wrists take over - drives it sumptuously wide of mid-wicket for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot! {{BATSMAN}} can bat. And he can to do it at a brisk rate. Delhi would want him to get them the momentum. On a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} stays leg-side and uses the space he created to drive on the rise past mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gift first up for {{BATSMAN}} and he says thank you very much. Fired full and down leg, might have been the attempted yorker, {{BATSMAN}} helps it away fine and the pace of {{BOWLER}} takes care of the rest\n",
            "Na{{BATSMAN}}em to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now clears his front leg and lofts it insi{{BATSMAN}}-out over the covers. The off-si{{BATSMAN}} field is up and Na{{BATSMAN}}em has bowled to his field by drifting it in on middle, but AB is just too good\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, loses radar. Yea, the overestimation of his swing - starting on the middle-stump line and expecting it to go across. But alas, it goes straight on, and {{BATSMAN}} makes it worse with his shuffle, tickling it off his thighs fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one bounce and into the cushions. That'll release a bit of pressure off {{BATSMAN}}. Picks the length early, rocks back and pulls the shortish delivery over square leg, one bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pressure? What's the spelling of that word? This guy seems to have exactly that sort of attitude. Gallops down the pitch, doesn't matter who's bowling, stamps his authority with a rollicking thump over mid-on. Came off the cue end, but he's got it under control with strong bottom hand power\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more! The runs are coming thick and fast for DD. Not the greatest of deliveries from {{BOWLER}}. Short and drifting down leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and pulls it fine, beating the diving fine leg fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third boundary of the over. {{BOWLER}} is going for plenty. Short delivery and at 132 clicks it is not going to trouble {{BATSMAN}}, who pulls it along the ground in front of square, the placement was perfect\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, offers some width to {{BATSMAN}}, who will not miss out on these. Reaches out and bullies it with serene timing through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full on middle, strong wrists from {{BATSMAN}} as he drives past mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lashes the cut between backward point and short third man. Short and wide from {{BOWLER}}, and this time it was a normal pace delivery. {{BATSMAN}} used that pace and carved it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh he's hit this for four. {{TEAM}} need 3 more to win and Rayudu needs one for a hundred. Length delivery down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} swings it away behind square on the on-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shaping in this time. But {{BOWLER}} has gone too full, making things easier for {{BATSMAN}}. Whips it past mid-wicket. Timed it beautifully\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that one sighter is enough. Premeditates another back of a length, gets his front leg out and delightfully crunches it, flat-batted through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the airrr, Pandey dives full length to his right at long-off and gets a hand on it. Excellent effort. Flighted delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} smashed it down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rare boundary for Delhi. Loosener from {{BOWLER}}, drifting it on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and whips it off his legs behind square. Splits the gap between deep square leg and fine leg to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, well-directed short ball from Kumar but {{BATSMAN}} manages to help it over the keeper. Gets himself into a tangle as he was late on the pull, however gets some glove on it and it purrs away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bludgeoned! A short of length delivery outside off which {{BATSMAN}} smokes through mid-wicket. To hit that well in front of square against someone like {{BOWLER}}, especially after having to fetch it from wide of off, it's a special shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} continues to march on. The wicket won't make a difference to him. A full length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} moves away and chips it over covers. Billings can't get there in time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played - a little counter-punch from young {{BATSMAN}} - bends down half-way, uses the pace on the ball and plays the reverse pull, behind square on the off-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, nicely tossed up on off, {{BATSMAN}} gets a big stride forward, gets close to the ball and drives it back past the non-striker, beats mid-off and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, phew! {{BOWLER}} despite getting a boot on that scorching drive, watches the ball run to the fence in a jiffy. Down the track and drilled so so hard\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's the boundary for the over Mumbai need. Low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} crouches a bit and uses the pace of {{BOWLER}}, opens the bat face and steers it between backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's decided that {{BOWLER}} has to go. Really good tactics from {{BATSMAN}}. These are gentle medium pace deliveries and he's backing himself to clear the infield. Goes over mid-on again. One bounce and over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classic shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Just a soft push from the crease to this full toss and it roars away to the fence. Beats extra cover, minimum effort there from the mighty Hash!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, poor line from {{BOWLER}}, short and on {{BATSMAN}}'s hips, he was looking to flick and missed, clipped the thigh-pad and beat the diving keeper - brings up the 50 for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off and running. {{BOWLER}} gets a bit greedy. Tries to swing it from middle-stump and in the process gives {{BATSMAN}} a freebie, flicked away uppishly over the square leg umpire\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft touch from {{BATSMAN}}. Pacy back of a length delivery, he just waits on it and dabs it late. Only had to beat the short third man fielder and he did it with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball again, this time much straighter, and so {{BATSMAN}} pulls it hard through square leg for four more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 94.8kph, back of the hand stuff, drifting down leg though and generously full. {{BATSMAN}} is quick to pounce on, sits, uses the angle and drills his sweep behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, intercepting the gap. Again. Dead straight with his drills down the ground. Banging it into the turf and it flies over the umpire and teases the two men converging. To beat them both\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, loose delivery. It's drifting onto the pads and all {{BATSMAN}} has to do is help it on its way. RCB can ill afford these errors, especially when they're defending a sub-par score\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, spinning away outside off, had been pushed through the air much quicker. {{BATSMAN}} sits back in the crease, anticipating it, and dabs it cunningly past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not in control but he's found the gap behind square on the leg-side. Short ball that climbed on {{BATSMAN}} who miscued the pull over backward square leg. Split fine leg and deep square leg with precision\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, was there bat involved? The ump thinks so. The premeditated shot fetches {{BATSMAN}} a boundary. It was fired outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reverses his stance and tries to play the reverse sweep. Probably, there was a bit of wood on it. DK can't stop it and there no one else to stop that from reaching the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Backed away, manufactured room and then slapped this short ball over backward point. Once bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he was saving the power for this shot. It was full and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} smkoes it straight down the ground and it rockets to fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, you need confidence to play that shot, especially against {{BOWLER}}. The off-break turning in, {{BATSMAN}} reverse sweeps it over backward point. Not off the middle, but once it cleared the infield it was going to be four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, this was full and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was backing away, plays with an open face and finds the gap behind square on the off-side, no one moved\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no stopping him, it seems. Short of a length and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slaps hard and evades the fielder at cover-point. He's in the zone folks!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, belted straight down the ground. {{BATSMAN}} knows what is coming from his Hyderabad teammate. Skips down and then brutalises the short of length delivery back over the bowler's head. Umpire was ducking for cover there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery and that's been put away. First boundary for {{BATSMAN}}! With fine leg inside the circle, he bowls a short ball down the leg-side. {{BATSMAN}} gets a glove on the pull and the ball goes fine of the fielder at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, neatly ramped. A cutter from {{BOWLER}}, which Faf's spotted early, shuffling big time and sitting under to scoop it over the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a shot that will shove you into a crisis. An outside edge or a glide? Yes, {{BATSMAN}} made room there but to drive, through covers. May have opened the bat face but that was an edge that beat short third, and raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed down the ground! {{BATSMAN}} into his 40s as he makes sure to make the bowler pay for pitching this one up. Played it straight as an arrow as the fielder at long-on couldn't get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} brings out the innovation. Spotted the leg-break early, gets low and reverse-sweeps it past short third man. Brilliant!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first four of the innings. Beats the five men on the off-side with a cracking cut. The width was there and he pounced on that beating a diving cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} breaks free and this is his first attacking shot of the night, fraction too full and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets his left leg out of the way, brings his bat down and thumps it back past the non-striker, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bashed over mid-wicket. The shot of a man in prime form. Not all that short from {{BOWLER}}, but {{BATSMAN}} quickly read the length, camped back and took heavy toll of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} flings his hands at it and carves it through backward point. It goes to the fence like a bullet\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} throws it wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} forces it behind square on the off-side and the ball races away towards the fence. The man in the deep isn't sharp to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, looks to defend and the ball trims the inside edge to run past the sticks. Cruel it is for the bowlers. The ball lifted up after landing on a length forcing the batsman to jab at it but the ball clipped the inner edge to run past the timbers and the keeper for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, it's a Test pitch now. Or seems like it. Spins in from outside off, sneaks through {{BATSMAN}}'s drive away from the body and misses off-stump by a whisker - in the way also beating Buttler to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} fails to reach the pitch of the ball, but his bat was gun-barrel straight and he lofts it straight down the ground for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, inswinger on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} hops and gets a fine tickle on the thigh pad and {{BOWLER}}'s pace takes care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it is not working for {{BOWLER}}. Hyderabad's fifth bowler is becoming a problem. Nadeem leaked runs and {{BOWLER}} too is going for a few. The back of hand but overpitched it, {{BATSMAN}} delays the loft and sends it soaring over extra cover, one bounce and over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, two in two for {{BATSMAN}}! Uses the pace on this short of a length delivery and glides it past the fielder at short third man. The dive by the man inside the ring wasn't able to stop the ball from making it to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, RJ dropped one short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} made room and then chopped it behind square on the off-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, the rib-tickler. With fine leg inside the ring, not sure if that's a great idea. {{BATSMAN}} hops and misses the tickle, the slow-low nature of the pitch means it shoots a bit low to take the thigh pad en route to fine leg fancy boards\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, fraction too short from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and pulls it in front of square on the on-side - beat mid-wicket and raced away across the fast outfield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, you are kidding me! What sort of a shot is this? He was almost beaten by the change of pace by this shortish slower ball, slapped it pretty straight towards long-on despite having to fetch this from outside off stump. Dhoni has been having long-on very wide fro {{BATSMAN}} and he had no chance. In fact, Dhoni and Bravo were not happy with Faf. Looks like he was standing very wide without instructions and maybe he was just wandering\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, runs down the track, gets close to the ball and drives it past the diving fielder at mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misses the yorker on this occasion and {{BATSMAN}} makes him pay. Fuller length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} plants his front foot across and hammers the drive through extra cover. Rocketed away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the line was quite similar again. Angled across tight on off-stump but {{BATSMAN}} goes for the pull this time. Was prepared on the back foot and swatted it away round the corner, with a deliciously awkward swivel\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's swept away over backward square leg and it's four more. Turns out to be a good start for {{BATSMAN}} and Gujarat. This was a delivery down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} sweeps, gets a bit of top edge but he swung hard to send it over the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the moment has arrived. Hundred for {{BATSMAN}}. His first this season and look at him go. Leaps up, roars in delight and brandishes his bat. Even the Kolkata crowd are going bonkers. Special knock from the Indian captain. Shuffles across his stumps and whiplashes it through mid-wicket. Kuldeep's miserable day continues as he fails to stop the ball near the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, skiddy and pacy back of a length delivery at 152.4kph, {{BATSMAN}} sees that coming. Clears his front leg and heaves it hard and over mid-wicket. Couple of bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not entirely in control but gets the result. Another slower ball variation from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} is early into the slog. Skies it high towards deep mid-wicket but it's in the gap. Finds the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is a bit streaky but {{BATSMAN}} won't mind. Bangs it short, {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull, gets a top-edge that flies over the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now then, now then, you can't bowl way too short and slow either. No sweeper cover remember, only third man and deep cover, so {{BATSMAN}} stands tall, delays the cut and hits it over the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Short ball. {{BATSMAN}} pulls and mid-off is in the ring, this will be a four, giving Delhi a much-needed win. Has this been given as four or is it only a single? Yes it is a four. Delhi win by 6-wickets\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, inside edge and four, on a good length and holding its line outside off, {{BATSMAN}} walked across on the swipe, gets a thick inside edge - past the off-stump and past the diving Parthiv. A hat-trick of boundaries for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, IT's a TIE. The scores are level as {{BATSMAN}} pulls this to the fence at deep mid-wicket. Dug in short, {{BATSMAN}} stayed back and placed it perfectly. SUPER OVER to decide the winner. Elation in both camps. Kohli is relieved for the moment and smiles that they haven't come second. He walks off briskly to push for a Super Over win\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, walks across towards off and effortlessly picks it away over backward square leg. Brilliantly timed yet again. Fine leg was up inside the ring and {{BATSMAN}} picked his spot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Gayle has given up! As soon as this was swept. Was the leg spinner around the leg stump and {{BATSMAN}} did well to elude Gayle at short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's edged and no one at slip. {{BOWLER}} delivers one outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard at it and gets a thick edge that escapes past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, backs across, gives away and swords the ball past point for a four. Much needed boundaries these for {{TEAM}}. The run rate getting a facelift here. Poor length again from {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's in autopilot mode now, {{BATSMAN}}! Gets to 8000 T20 runs! Not a bad ball, almost the perfect wide yorker from {{BOWLER}} but {{BATSMAN}} is in the zone now. Waits deep in the crease and opens the bat face late. Bisects short third man and backward point easily\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and again! Much better from {{BATSMAN}}, not so from {{BOWLER}}. Short again and allows the left-hander to free his arms. Punches this on the up and splits the gap at cover. This should get the {{TEAM}} skipper going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another one! The bowlers have no answers to this brilliance by the {{TEAM}} pair. The left hand - right hand combination is make it difficult for the bowlers. This was floated on middle and {{BATSMAN}} went down on his knee to sweep it through square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball on middle stump, {{BATSMAN}} smacks the pull through square leg. Smith just throws his head back after another poor delivery\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sat up on a perfect length to be smashed, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and nails the pull over mid-wicket. Take four!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow, get the thesaurus out. That's been cracked away with utter disdain. Short and wide yeah, but look at the sound the bat makes. Pinches the slightest gap at point and lasers it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets it away very, very fine! Didn't intend to get it that fine perhaps but he won't mind, will he? The perfect yorker from {{BOWLER}} but {{BATSMAN}} digs it out with an open bat face. Manages to slice itwell past a diving de Kock to the fence. When it's your day, it's just your day!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, strays on to the pads from over the wicket and has been tickled away fine for a four. {{TEAM}} will take these\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not the ideal start for {{BOWLER}}. Fullish and swinging into the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} flicks, fine leg is inside the ring and he had no chance. Off the mark in a flash\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} moves leg-side and slaps it straight back past the bowler. Mid-off was up inside the ring, and {{BATSMAN}} is able to slot it to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball sitting up, and {{BATSMAN}} pulls it with authority through deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, back of a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, lets the ball come onto him and then defltly glides it past the keeper, third man was square and has no chance, 21 from the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, floated up outsi{{BATSMAN}} off and has been spanked past cover for a four. That was hit really hard and the man at {{BATSMAN}}ep cover {{BATSMAN}}spite trying his best just couldn't stop it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, irritating runs these. {{BATSMAN}}'s edges are back to deal. {{BOWLER}} gets some extra bounce on his top-spinner but all that comes in handy with {{BATSMAN}} looking to sit and slog. The top-edge runs past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! That is a fine shot. Moved away to leg and even a dragged back length didn't deter him, went up and over the infield off the back foot. A very difficult shot to play but {{BATSMAN}} made it look easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ruins what should've been a really good over. Slips into the pads and {{BATSMAN}} plays some sort of a half-flick, half-sweep to nail it in the gap behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, absolute smash back, tennis forehand. A walk, clearing the front leg and a swat downtown, with {{BOWLER}} getting a fingertip as he tries pulling his hand out of the way. Oh and also, a fifty -- and revenge for the 2019 WC is well and truly complete\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary conceded by {{BOWLER}}. 121.4kph back of a length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} had the width to work with and he times the pants off this backfoot punch, sweeper was not on the boundary line and he is not able to cut the angle as the ball races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely struck! Overpitched and {{BATSMAN}} makes room to biff it over extra cover. Clean hit and in the gap as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, walks across. Sits down. Gets under the fuller delivery and scoops it over the keeper. Almost off the toe end but with the field behind square up in the circle it seems safe\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, uppish, but in the gap. {{BOWLER}} offers width on this short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't go hard at it. Stays back in the crease and dabs it aerially through the gap between backward point and cover-point. He used the bowler's pace (143.4kph) to good effect\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classic counterattack by Surya. This was a dropped catch at mid-wicket as Narine failed to reverse cup it, parrying it away to the fence. {{BOWLER}} bowled an overpitched delivery on leg and the right hander flicks it uppishly for the fourth boundary of the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, skids through low, a tad short, {{BATSMAN}} gets low and carves it away through the gap between cover point and backward point for four - bisected perfectly. Surgical precision\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy for {{BATSMAN}}. He is a class player. A gift from {{BOWLER}}, down leg, with fine leg inside the circle, a beautiful leg-glance and {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark with four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not a bad start! Short ball at the body and pulled away into the on-side for a four. The man at fine leg had no chance. He played it slightly late but did well to get enough meat on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bit more air, and {{BATSMAN}} sweeps hard, beats mid-wicket on the dive to his left and {{BATSMAN}}ep square has no chance. Too full and {{BATSMAN}} found the middle of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of the bounce and cracks it behind square on the off-side. Beats backward point to his right and the man getting across in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is flowing like a river. He is timing the ball so very well. But the required rate demands more out of this. It was a slower one on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it handsomely, beats fine leg and it races to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, on a good length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, drives it on the up and clears Lynn at short extra-cover, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} are dealing in boundaries at the moment, tad too full and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward, closed the face of the bat and drives it in between the non-striker and the umpire, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, once again, {{BATSMAN}} steps out of his crease, this time he manages to get under it and club it over wide mid-on for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! A brave shot from Jaddu. Waltzes down the track, gets to the pitch of the delivery and thumps it down the ground. With mid-on inside the circle, that's a safe shot. Gets it well wide of him and the ball has enough legs to go past the boundary rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, punched and K.O! That was actually a pile driver down the ground. Picks the short of length delivery and punishes it down the ground, uppishly, for a four past mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much needed boundary for {{TEAM}}! {{BATSMAN}} didn't get hold of the slog sweep that well here, still got enough and also found the placement well. Speeds away to the deep square leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more leg-lined, but {{BATSMAN}}'s quick to make room this time, and his outside edge is thick and hard enough in the wafty drive to run away through the empty slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stand and deliver! Mid-off was inside the ring. {{BOWLER}} offers width on the back of a length and {{BATSMAN}} flat-bats it straight past the fielder at mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, on the pads, clipped away to deep mid-wicket and that has raced away to the fence in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss and he's crashed that over extra-cover, the shoulders are dropping in the Orange camp. The yellow in the stands is very bright. {{BATSMAN}} got down low on his knees and loft-drove that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, connects this time! Clear intent from {{BATSMAN}}, walks down the track and makes room to loft it inside out over extra cover. Clean strike and it races to the fence on the bounce\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nearly holed out. But gets four thanks to Morris' fumble. At long-on. He went for the catch, but the ball bounced in front of him and since he didn't get his body behind the line of the ball, it runs away. Was a full-toss and {{BATSMAN}} biffed that in the air\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gee that's disrespectful. Transfers the weight on the front foot and flat-bats it over {{BOWLER}}'s head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top-edge through fine leg. A delivery going down leg from over the wicket, the left-hander is in no shape to sweep that. Goes for it and gets lucky\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} seals it with a boundary! Short from {{BOWLER}}, enough width for {{BATSMAN}} to slap it past backward point. Superb chase from the Gujarat Lions to hopefully provide a boost to their turbulent campaign\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, different bowler and {{BATSMAN}} takes him on this time. Not the ideal start from {{BOWLER}}, dropped it way too short, gave {{BATSMAN}} enough time to camp back and smash it over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, excellent shot from {{BATSMAN}}. This will give him some confidence. He comes down the track and at the same time makes room for himself to loft it over deep cover for a handsome boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he got out against CSK playing this, but that was to an offie, this is a leggie, reverse-swept and well wi{{BATSMAN}} of backward point. {{BOWLER}} is welcomed with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nothing dicey here. {{BOWLER}} feeds him a high full toss outside off and {{BATSMAN}} neatly opens his bat face to carve it backward of point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, would need many more of these. A wide liner this from Bhajji and {{BATSMAN}} capitalizes with a reverse as he brooms it past the lone man perched at point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a half-tracker by {{BOWLER}} and it has spoiled the over for him. Was proving to be quite economical till then. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back in his crease and hammers the pull as it beats the sprinter at deep mid-wicket. Bowled well against Rana, but not so well against {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, only slightly short, the ball slides in on leg, and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to go back in the crease. He effortlessly whips a pull over square leg and beats long leg to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} goes aerial and clears mid-off. Didn't time it as he would've liked but just enough to clear the fielder. On a back of a length on off, {{BATSMAN}} used his bottom hand to good effect to chip it over the ring. Couple of bounces and home\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, jumps down the pitch and looks to mow across the line. The bat face turns on impact and the leading edge runs wide of a diving short third. Much-needed boundary that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, that's quite a way to get going, dropped short and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets halfway down and pummels it past square leg. {{BOWLER}} is disappointed, knew immediately that it was a bad first ball to the new batsman\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the swing from {{BOWLER}} takes him on the pads once more, {{BATSMAN}} stays in the crease and whips a glance down to the fine leg boundary. Brisk start from the Kings XI\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this short ball sits up nicely outside off and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it, maintains solid base and swat-pulls it in the gap through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, seems like Ashwin has ran out of options...a short and wide hit-me from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} smacks it off the back foot behind point. Too easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's been helped away quite fine from {{BATSMAN}}, capitalizing superbly on just a bit of misdirection from {{BOWLER}} who strayed ever so slightly on middle and leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, would you believe it? Morris allows the ball to escape past him. Has his hands up to apologise to {{BOWLER}}. Short delivery and {{BATSMAN}} pulls it without much timing. Morris was reluctant to come for the catch. Tries to take it on the bounce, but the side spins beats him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}} - not all that convincing, but he will take the runs on offer - the idea was right, fine leg was inside the ring and he was looking to clear him - late on the shot, off the gloves and past the diving keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, banged in short and into the gut, but {{BATSMAN}} is quick enough to swivel into a shimmering pull to the backward square leg fence for four! Pretty picture, that...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a salute in celebration. Takes the bat to his head in holding it up to his team mates inside. Covers all his sticks with a shuffle and after getting bored of the wides throws the kitchen sink at it and slaps it over point. #HisFastestIPLFifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} goes downtown once more and gets the desired result. {{BOWLER}} goes fuller with the tossed up delivery and {{BATSMAN}} drills it straight back at {{BOWLER}}, who is slow to get down and stop it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball, pulled away and no man in the deep mid-wicket region allows the ball to race away into the fence. Chahal from deep square ran across and the ball sandwiches between him and the ground to ensure that he is in some pain. Hope he is OK as he has a grimacing expression on his face\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full on off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't time it perfectly but manages to drive it through the gap at extra cover. Rajasthan Royals, who almost messed up the chase at the end, have been bailed out by {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now this is a fine, fine yorker.. and look what happens. {{BATSMAN}} squeezes it out with an open bat face and has that scooting to the third man fence. Who says cricket's for egalitarians?!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hammered past long-off. Flighted outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lowers his stance and reaches out to smack it in the gap. Even Dre Russ can't stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} win! {{BATSMAN}} does it for his team. No big celebrations. Just a big smile and then a hug with Hardik Pandya. Low full toss as {{BOWLER}} missed the yorker, thumped wide of extra cover and mid-off was inside the ring as well. Raced away and {{TEAM}} have done the double over RCB this season - but it must be said that the Kohli-led side had chances to win both games. 8th loss for RCB out of 11 this year. {{TEAM}} go top of the table\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball, bad ball and put away. The batsman was waiting for it and swats the pull away fine on the on-side for a four. Crisply timed and it ran away. {{BATSMAN}} has run into a massive purple patch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets lucky. Sliced the slower delivery straight up but it had enough elevation to clear the short third man fielder. Came down the track and aimed to go over cover, was beaten by the angle across him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, back of a length on off, {{BATSMAN}} is early into the pull. The ball kisses the back thigh and escapes past Karthik, he dived over the ball there. Bonus runs for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short, angling across. But {{BATSMAN}} goes almost as deep as his stumps and waits for the slant to get big as he pulls it away, splitting the massive leg-sided gap perfectly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, {{BATSMAN}} at his best, moved all around the crease - {{BOWLER}} saw it coming and went wide of off, but {{BATSMAN}} still reaches out and then paddles it over short fine - think, only AB could have rivalled him for that shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the outside edge flies between keeper and slip. Absolutely flew off the bat. Length ball ripping away from off, draws {{BATSMAN}} forward in defence and the turn is prodigious. Watson is slow to react, and when he does, it doesn't stick in the left hand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, was that a punch or a cut! But was beautifully done as he used the pace of the bowler to send it away. The man at deep cover put in a clumsy dive but couldn't cut it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, if the last one was {{BATSMAN}}'s brilliance, this one is {{BOWLER}}'s mediocrity. Strays on leg stump and is glanced fine for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what has Gayle done there? He's kicked that ball away to the boundary. Went for the chase from short third man and ends up kicking it away to the fence. {{BATSMAN}} went hard at this one as the thick outside edge flew over the fielders at short third and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time he does! {{BATSMAN}} gets third time lucky. Another shorter length delivery from {{BOWLER}} and was perhaps a touch closer to {{BATSMAN}} who connected the ramp nicely. Over Karthik and very fine which means third man has no chance. Nice innovation\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air and in the gap! On a good length that swings away a tad, {{BATSMAN}} presses forward and shows the full face of his bat as he drives uppishly. Gets it between mid-off and extra cover. The quick outfield does the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another sublime shot by Shikhar! Puts on his dancing shoes and bludgeons the shortish delivery through mid-on. The fielder was very square, hence this was always heading to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, tossed up well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across, gets well outside off and sweeps it behind square on the on-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, comes dancing down the pitch and punch-drives the full delivery to the left of mid-off, {{BATSMAN}} batting with full freedom and he has got the license to do that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, awful from {{BOWLER}}. He bangs it in very short but the speedometer just shows 128kph. The ball was actually on its way down when {{BATSMAN}} slashed it over backward point. GL being clobbered out there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stand and deliver! A tossed up delivery by {{BOWLER}}, goes a touch full and {{BATSMAN}} slams it past the bowler. {{BOWLER}} hardly had any time to react, but believe me, had he got his hands to it, he could've been seriously injured. It was hit so hard!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's been thrashed through extra cover. A fuller length ball, stand-and-deliver stuff from {{BATSMAN}}. Stood tall and hammered the drive between extra cover and mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wowww! What an off-drive, the strike-rate is up and running again. Very brave from Ro to have mid-off in at this stage, but Watto made full use of this juicy full ball and powered it to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, {{BATSMAN}} is a top all-rounder for Karnataka and this shot just certifies it, read the leg-break, opens the face of the bat, used the pace on the ball and ran it past the lone slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now the bowler overcompensates by bowling short. There wasn't much of width on this one, but hopped and backed away slightly to create a bit of room and cut it away to the right of backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft now! He has the bowler by his mercy. That was short, outside off and the batsman opens the face of the blade to guide it fine on the off-side. Third man was moved square after the last ball and had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely! No fancy shots from {{BATSMAN}}. He uses {{BOWLER}}'s extra pace to his advantage, stays leg-side of the short of length delivery, opens the bat face and directs it behind square on the off-side, split backward point and short third man expertly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what he's done here is ruled out Guptill at backward point. Hit it over him, and wide of him. Short and wide, talls up and cuts it ferociously. Powerplay done: 46 for 3\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, delicious, absolutely delicious stroke! More width and the length is shorter as well, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't go hard at it, instead relies purely on timing and boy, didn't he time this or what? Stays back and guides it past the left of the backward point fielder and it raced away. Third man had no chance at all\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the airrr, could be out, oh the fielder makes a mess of it. Low full toss, {{BATSMAN}} slogs, should have been held at deep mid-wicket, Dagar the sub wasn't quick enough to move forward, he dived but let it pass. He's immediately moved out of that position\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. This was banged in short by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} took his eyes off the ball, still went through with the pull, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes. {{BOWLER}} looks amused, that ball didn't deserve a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third boundary today that {{BOWLER}} has conceded off the pads. Just straying a touch with the swing. Curling in on leg, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and just tickles it through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, worrying signs for Mumbai. They can't afford to leak runs from both ends. {{BATSMAN}} holds a good shape and lofts the length delivery inside out over extra cover. A calculated shot as mid-off was inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and another ventilator-shot - the kind that just about keeps a chase alive. It's another slower-wide combo, but {{BATSMAN}}'s not getting fooled (any longer). Throws his bat out and slices it away over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, they're still in this. Quite unbelievable. Full length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swings for the rafters and sends a thick edge flying past short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it. Low full toss, {{BATSMAN}} sinks low and smacks the sweep through square leg. Off the sweet spot of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fourth boundary in five balls for {{BATSMAN}}. The start is getting better for DD. {{BOWLER}} overcompensates and goes full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} is up for it and cracks the drive past the diving cover-point fielder. Sped away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is a monster when he gets going that is. Stands on the crease and butchers this slowish off-cutter that sits up, beats extra cover with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh what a shot! {{BOWLER}} over pitches this full delivery, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and drives hard through cover, Chahal dives to his right and gets a hand on it, yet the ball comfortably reached the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fabulous shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Sets up a solid base and caresses it past long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much needed boundary. Another slower delivery, {{BATSMAN}} dances down and heaves it away into the deep square leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, inside-out over covers. Perhaps only Raina matches him there. Reads the flight early, drags himself inside the line and then goes over covers. Boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picks the legbreak, jumps back inside the crease and clobbers the pull over square leg. In the gap and that's a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, advances, gets to the pitch of the delivery and nails the straight drive. Take four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ah, shot! Top stroke! This should get {{BATSMAN}} going. One of his favourite strokes, stands up tall and punches this wide of the man at extra cover. Wasn't that bad a ball, just a super shot and from the look of things, this pitch looks a belter\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, moves leg-side evn before the ball is delivered does {{BATSMAN}} and that would have distracted the bowler. {{BOWLER}} fires one well down the leg-side and that's easy pickings for the skipper. Stays low and sweeps wide of the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, nice way to get going, that should give {{BATSMAN}} plenty of confidence, length delivery on his pads, he prods across and clips it in front of square on the on-side, beats the infield and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played, too straight from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across, gets inside the line and picks the gap wide of mid-on with the on-drive, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, poor delivery and deserved four. High full-toss sliding down leg, brushes the thigh pad of {{BATSMAN}} and beats Pant's dive to his left. Runs away fast to the fine leg fence. {{BOWLER}} has been disappointing with the ball tonight\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, but that was a bad misfield from the man at cover - on a good length and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leant into the drive and found cover - who let the ball go through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, threads the gap this time. Pure class from {{BATSMAN}}. Stands still and lets his hands do the talking. Punches a back of a length delivery crisply through cover-point, beats the packed off-side field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely pull shot. Short delivery, but {{BATSMAN}} rocked back to power it through square leg, Unadkat runs to his left in the deep but can't stop it. But why is he running around near the rope and not bowling?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's an old-fashioned heave from {{BATSMAN}}. He gets behind that back of a length delivery and tonks it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, through Jaddu's fingers at mid-off. Length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stays leg-side of the ball and carves it flirtingly past the fieldsman at mid-off. Jaddu leapt full length, but the execution from {{BATSMAN}} was too good\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crafty and controlled. The short ball, the batsman gets on top of it and guides it past short fine leg for a four. The man at short fine leg and deep square leg tried to cut it off but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, all these are bonus runs. Banged in short and aimed for the badge on the helmet, {{BATSMAN}} pulls and the top-edge runs away fine beating Patel near the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too straight. Never an ideal follow up delivery, never an ideal any delivery. {{BATSMAN}}'s quick to pounce, shuffles inwards and tucks, splitting the gap between the keeper and short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pressure telling on {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} is ruthless. Harmless short ball that's pulled away through square leg. 'Gabbar' seizing the momentum straightaway\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary of the final, {{BOWLER}} offers a freebie, it was a half-volley outside off. {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and squeezes it behind square on the off-side, beats backward point and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, back of a length and just outside off, he waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and taps it past the lone slip, beats the man getting across from third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Shorey again can't get there. Quicker and attacking the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} heaves it to cow corner - right between deep mid-wicket and long-on, Shorey runs to his left this time and can't stop the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short googly, pulled away to deep mid-wicket, Uthappa runs to his right, gets to the ball but fumbles as he tries to hop and stop the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, up and over screams Danny. Short ball zoning into the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} archs his body back and uppercuts the ball away over the man at point for a four. Hat-trick of fours and {{TEAM}} try to break the shackles\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, errs in line after a good start. This is a shortish one on leg and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out on the chance. Swivels and drags it down to the fine leg fence, can't keep a fielder there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a good shot by {{BATSMAN}}. Has timed the ball nicely so far. Gets one overpitched dolly on the pads and he makes sure to put it away to the deep mid-wicket fence with a flick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fab shot! More authority this time from {{BATSMAN}} who sat back to the half-tracker and nailed the pull comfortably over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is almost predictable. {{BOWLER}} has the pace to trouble {{BATSMAN}}, so one could see the bouncer coming. {{BATSMAN}} was already backing away before the bowler delivered the ball and easily managed to pull it over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more! 118.8kph, slow and full, {{BATSMAN}} slightly looks to squeeze it out and gets another outside edge that beats a diving Pant to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stuck in the crease while flashing a drive away from the body, runs away off the edge for four. Third man was up in the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good follow-up with the slower delivery but got the length wrong. And the line. Shortish outside off, allowing {{BATSMAN}} to stay back and flash it square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 135ks hint of width outside off and {{BATSMAN}} lashes on it with a fierce cut through point. {{TEAM}} and {{BATSMAN}} off the mark in style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, so he bowls three dots, there is this urge to get your name in the wickets column, especially in this format and in this tournament, so {{BOWLER}} tries the fancy slower ball when back of a length was perfectly working for him, {{BATSMAN}} pounces on the short delivery and powers the pull over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, the wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}}, but the length is way too short, allows {{BATSMAN}} to go back and whip it behind square on the on-side - no one in the deep and the ball runs away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} puts bat to it and guides it wide of the short fine leg fielder for a four. DD needs more of these shots from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, use of the feet again, {{BATSMAN}} is just rubbing it into {{BOWLER}}, who has had a catch being put down. Goes straight down the ground and over the umpire's head. Into the 90s now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another bumper, another pull. {{BATSMAN}}'s not in control, but it doesn't matter, it's the powerplay after all. Drags it from outside off in front of square, and nothing the chase or the dive from the guy chasing it from square leg can do to stop\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball, {{BATSMAN}} shows his class. Shuffles forward and towards the delivery and opens the bat face to slice it behind point. Pure timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, Narine gave up the chase very early, this was tossed up on middle, {{BATSMAN}} went down low, used the pace on the ball and lapped it fine, beat short fine and rolled away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh this one kept low and it's very unlucky for the bowler that the ball has gone for four despite taking the inside edge of the bat. This was the slider on the shorter side, {{BATSMAN}} went back to pull, the ball didn't rise, went off the inner part and split short fine leg and backward square leg to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drags it short, the arm-ball went wrong. Fired it outside off, {{BATSMAN}} cuts that hard and eludes a diving cover-point to his left. As soon as he got it past the fielder, it was four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another. Keep 'em counting. Another half-volley, and this one's been scorched through covers with an elegant bat flow. The deliveries remain the same, only {{BATSMAN}}'s shots are evolving into something more telegenic\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and powers the pull in the gap through mid-wicket, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, yes he can! {{BOWLER}} is not learning, doles out a friendly full toss on off, {{BATSMAN}} opens the bat face and slices it behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, consecutive boundaries and this was not a poor delivery. Fab shot from Watto. Spotted third man inside the ring, waited for the back of a length delivery on off and dabbed it past a diving backward point, the quick outfield takes care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brute power! Fuller in length from {{BOWLER}} this time, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and absolutely smashes it wide of the mid-off fielder for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, boom. With 24 runs needed per ball, {{BATSMAN}}'s managed one-sixth, but it's a night time one-sixth. Backing away, getting under {{BOWLER}}'s full one and swinging downtown\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, leans forward, takes on the short pepper head-on and mows it across the line. Not the timing but once again the placement in finding the gap to bounce it into the cow corner fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finally {{BATSMAN}} gets off the mark. Was waiting for a loose delivery and he has latched onto it with both hands. Throws the kitchen sink at this short and wide ball and cuts it over backward point as the fielder in the deep couldn't do nothing about it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stamping of authority from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} gets predictable, bangs it short and it sits up wonderfully for {{BATSMAN}}. Rocks back and pummels it wide of mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky from {{BATSMAN}}. He brings out the reverse sweep and plays it fine of the short third man for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and cuts, beats backward point and sweeper cover has too much ground to cover. Beats him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! A full throttle cross bat swing against a length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} sends a huge chunk of top-edge on that, one bounce and over the ropes at third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, right off the toe-end from {{BATSMAN}} as he slashes at a wide length ball. Balloons over backward point, and beats a stiff effort from Tahir at third man as he couldn't bend down enough to cut it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the yorker goes wrong. Just an inch too full, just a degree too leg-sided and {{BATSMAN}} has easy pickings, flicking it perfectly behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back fours for {{BATSMAN}}. And this crowd is buzzing with excitement. {{BOWLER}} is looking for some swing on offer, he bowls another fuller length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} takes a good stride forward and drives it like a boss through cover. No stopping that!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's pierced that gap so well. Shortish and spinning away outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} cuts well and sends it between cover and cover-point. He wants to make the most of this powerplay\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in an attempt to keep it away from {{BATSMAN}}'s range, {{BOWLER}} sprays it down leg, the left hander gets enough bat on the glance to take the ball fine and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sliced over point! Rifles it full and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and hits it uppishly in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, almost prised out {{BATSMAN}} with his first ball. Fuller and straightened just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was pushing forward without any intent and feeds an outside edge which beats MS to his left and runs away to the third man boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a risky shot but {{BATSMAN}} backs himself to ramp a short of length delivery into the third man boundary. He got it fine enough of the fielder. One bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Manish hasn't had a great day in the field - fuller length delivery and well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} sliced the drive wide of cover. Manish got across to his left at long-on and then went one-handed on the stop - can't stop it cleanly and the ball hit the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, kneels down and sweeps {{BOWLER}} between long-on and deep mid-wicket. Gee! This is some exhibition\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fine! Excellent start for {{TEAM}}. Shuffles across a long way does {{BATSMAN}} and helps this length ball on leg, down to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} makes room, gets followed by a short ball but does not flinch. Goes with the pull - tennis-like heave - and sends it to the deep mid-wicket fence on the bounce\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball, comes late to {{BATSMAN}} - that is what the shot suggested. {{BATSMAN}} is early on the pull and slices off the outer edge, over the head of the keeper and into the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower length ball on leg stump, too easy for {{BATSMAN}} who is well aware of short fine leg's presence inside the ring. Just whips it past the man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 89.3kph, the googly spinning away across the left-hander outside off. {{BATSMAN}} swings hard, balance out of sync and elicits a thick outside edge which flies through the vacant slip region. {{BOWLER}} has his hands on his head.. lucky {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} errs in line and {{BATSMAN}} makes him pay. Half-tracker down leg, {{BATSMAN}} will keep putting this away to the fence, seven days a week and twenty four hours a day. Half-swivels and helps it away past short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, back of a length and on the stumps, he waits on it, opens the face of the bat and runs it past the keeper. The pace of {{BOWLER}} does the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bad ball. Down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} does not have to do much, sweeps it well to the fine leg fence. Was trying a googly there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} takes the adventure route. Walks across his sticks, waits for the ball to arrive and scooped it over short fine leg. Knew the fine leg was inside the ring and hence opted for the shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Kohli drops a tough chance here, now, now, he better not hurt his shoulder here. That right one is still sore, we all know. Miscues to deep mid-wicket, Virat Kohli hops back to take it, jumps just in time but tips the ball through. Umpires check if it has touched the ropes as VK looks to recover the ball, and he had\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a friendly flighted {{BATSMAN}}livery full and outsi{{BATSMAN}} off stump, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and doesn't over-hit the ball, drives nicely along the ground and hits the gap at cover. The ball escapes past the diving fiel{{BATSMAN}}r\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 124.4kph, slow, short and wide. {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and throws his bat at it. Gets a fat top-edge that flies over the short third man fielder. Uthappa did run back and dived but to no avail\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful timing. That sped off his bat through backward point. Back of length just outside off, not that bad a delivery, but {{BATSMAN}} leans back and spears a cut through to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, uncocks the wrists on impact and goes inside out to get a four over cover. One bounce into the fence. Shot of the day so far. The execution looked serene despite not a lot of followthrough with the bat. Just a suplex of the wrists\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, quintessentially {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} was from round the wicket to the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} charges down whilst making some room and lofts it through extra cover. Superb hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Lovely piece of timing. {{BOWLER}} bowls full in search of swing, it did swing away a touch, but {{BATSMAN}} was nicely forward to cream the cover drive from the middle of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} has erred big-time with the leg-cutter and {{BATSMAN}} gets him away. It's well down the leg-side and {{BATSMAN}} whips it over short fine leg for four. It was so close to clearing the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, have seen him practice those switch-hits in the training, it's coming out so well. Careful Davey, don't let the rule-makers take notice and force a rule change. This is smashed through point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sliced over point. {{BOWLER}} goes round the wicket and dishes out a floaty lazy non-warmed-up delivery that's full, wide and worthy of a dispatch. Yep, over backward\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that previous ball has messed his line up. This time he goes full at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles inside the line of it and whips it away to the fine leg boundary. Top batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 16 runs off the over and not the best of outings for {{BOWLER}} on IPL debut. He finishes with 3-0-35-0. Once more the slower delivery is on the shortish length, {{BATSMAN}} waits and cuts it behind square, splitting backward point and short third man to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, unorthodoxy from {{BATSMAN}}. Brings out his patented ramp, getting low in time and elevating it over the short third man fielder. {{BOWLER}} has a cheeky smile on his face\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more than 80 percent of {{BATSMAN}}'s runs have come off short deliveries so far. KXIP aren't learning. To make matters worse, {{BOWLER}} sprays it down leg and all {{BATSMAN}} needed to do was help it on its way. Karun Nair dives, but all of that sliding effort goes in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's the first boundary of the innings. Length ball on leg, {{BATSMAN}} whips it away fine enough to beat fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and that is fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! He has wasted no time today to get going. 45th Fifty plus score for {{BATSMAN}}. Flat-batted it down the ground and got it over mid-on for a four. On a track where batters have struggled for timing, he has looked in supreme touch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flurry of boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}. And {{TEAM}} are off to a sensational start. It was a short of length on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} pulls it wide of the keeper for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, excellent timing! Another delivery pitched on a full length by KG, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and just play a gentle push. Timing is good enough to beat the fielder at wide mid-off as the ball rockets to the fence, two boundaries in the over so far..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fuller length delivery on middle, whipped away from the crease past mid-on to the long-on fence for four. Fantastic shot.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh, this will do for the Royals. Finally, {{BATSMAN}} gets some bat. Goes low and scoops this full ball at the stumps over short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sweep shot off a pacer. You don't see that often. The slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} spotted it very early, went across his stumps and broomed it over short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} overpitches and {{BATSMAN}} takes heavy toll of it. The back leg is bent, to the pitch and then creamed the cover drive. The placement was spot on too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a gift first up for {{BATSMAN}}. Short delivery at 128kph, sat up nicely for the in form keeper, who swivels across and pulls it neatly behind square, well away from the short fine leg fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Archer dives but fails to stop the ball at deep mid-wicket. Short delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} pulls, deep mid-wicket runs to his left, actually got there but made a mess of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back of a length around off, what a late-cut that is. Played it so late, almost behind him, splits backward point and short third to perfection. No third man and too wi{{BATSMAN}} for sweeper to get across\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slightly more open-chested from {{BOWLER}} from wide of the crease, angles it into a short of length spot, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and has a slash at it, gets a top-edge that just evades the 'keeper's leap to the third man (almost long stop) boundary for four. 17 off the over!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's not gonna miss out twice in two balls. {{BOWLER}} drifts another one on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} gets the faintest of touches on the ball and it races away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is batting of the highest order. The cross-seamer on a fuller length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} takes a step across and lofts it inside out through extra cover. Iyer at sweeper had no chance. The placement was equisite\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has no trouble this time. Slow, short and wi{{BATSMAN}} outsi{{BATSMAN}} off. AB jumps and slaps it up and over extra cover. Easily done\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed! This is an excellent shot. On a length and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} uses a straight bat and tonks it straight down the ground. It rockets to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four. Flighted outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drives and the ball flies off the outside edge, runs away fine and Rana had no chance catching up with it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} breaks the shackles! Runs down the track, looked like he lost his shape on the shot, ends up slapping it through extra-cover, beats the infield and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, leggie on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} clears his leg and flicks it nonchalantly, he finds the gap wi{{BATSMAN}} of long-on and it thuds into the fence. Welcome boundary for {{BATSMAN}} and RCB\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, advances down, gets beside the ball, lofts it over extra cover. Lovely batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not a good finish by {{BOWLER}}. Another loosener outside off, too short and wide of off. {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat and drills it hard along the ground through extra cover. Strong bottom-hand power and beats a desperate dive from Klaasen at sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky runs but they all count! Flattish and turning away from around off, {{BATSMAN}} was squared up all ends up on the flick. Thick edge and it beat backward point, all the way to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clears a flying extra cover fiel{{BATSMAN}}r! Good hit from the increasingly tired {{BATSMAN}}. Ma{{BATSMAN}} room and read the slower ball well before slapping it over the infield. Smashed it really well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this was even better. A full and tossed up delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} strides forward and lofts it to perfection over extra-cover. His confidence is high and that shot will make him feel even better\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drifting on leg-stump and it's been cutely paddled away. Runs very fine, through keeper's left and runs for a boundary. Not a great start that by {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky! First ball and {{BATSMAN}} is down on his knee to play the paddle, uses the pace on the ball and places it fine, the lightning fast outfield took care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's helicopter-slashed it through backward point. Not a great delivery. It's short and wide from {{BOWLER}}, just the kind of ball {{BATSMAN}} needs to break his shackles\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a nice drive through covers. {{BATSMAN}} leaning a bit into it and reminding {{BOWLER}} that he wasn't the batsman who faced the short ball, so a full ball outside off isn't going to work\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is turning out to be a fine start for {{TEAM}}, too short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side, beat short fine and rolled away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! Streaky way to get off the mark, but {{BATSMAN}} won't mind. Seam-up delivery that shapes away a tad, {{BATSMAN}} chases it with a slash and gets a fat outside edge. The ball flies between slip and short third man. First boundary of the innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball and drop-kicked over mid-off. Played the drive on the up, did not intend to keep it down and got it over the head of the fielder for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is too good with those pick ups. Sees the back of a length delivery around the hip region, {{BATSMAN}} maintains a strong base and swats it behind square on the leg-side, no chance for deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Punjab have got boundaries but not all of them have been well timed ones. This one too is not. {{BATSMAN}} makes room, tries to go flat-bat on this short ball. Mistimes but does well to get it just over the fielder at mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is a proper pull. Dragged down by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} was onto the back foot in a flash, pulled it between wide long-on and deep mid. Found the gap to perfection. Hit hard as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, make it a hat-trick of boundaries, he's toying with {{BOWLER}}, comes down the track, gets close to the ball and does enough to clear the leaping fielder at mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50-run stand up for the second wicket. Short ball by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} lines up for it. Treks back in the crease and pulls it over mid-wicket. Having conceded two boundaries in the over, {{BOWLER}} opts for a deep mid-wicket immediately\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh boy, that's top quality stuff! Slower ball from {{BOWLER}} but {{BATSMAN}} is in such a mood that he is picking everything. Waits for it and there was width on offer, so just reached out to hammer it through the covers. Rocketed away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that ruins the over for {{BOWLER}}, leg-stump half-volley, all {{BATSMAN}} had to do was get some bat on that. Once he did - fine-leg, who was inside the ring had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot by {{BATSMAN}}! Pitched on a full length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} eyes the covers boundary and lifts this one over the infield. No fielders in the deep and that shall be four runs for the left hander\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slapped, short of a length and shaping away from outside off, {{BATSMAN}} plays with the angle and carves it behind square on the off-side, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a gift and {{BATSMAN}} is too good a player to miss out. Full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} does nothing fancy, just uses the pace on the ball and lofts it over extra cover. It was a safe shot with mid-off inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sinks on the sweep. Barely gets himself in control of it. The stride doesn't even get close enough to the pitch of the delivery as he top-edges it in the end. Has a boundary to his name with the man charging in from fine leg sacrificing some runs in the quest of looking to take the catch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ruins the over. But it was a top shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Speared into the blockhole and {{BATSMAN}} almost casually squeezes the slice past the diving point fielder, the lightning fast outfield takes care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dismissive pull from {{BATSMAN}}. Skiddy short of length just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets quickly onto the back foot and short-arm jabs it wide of mid-on. Rolled his wrists at the right time to find the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gift from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} accepts it gleefully. Good length ball on the pads, he leans forward and clips it neatly past the square leg umpire, the quick outfield does the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed past the stumps at the other end. Too full and {{BATSMAN}} has drilled that in a flash. Rocketed away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it. Gets into a good position and smack the pull through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's powerfully struck! {{BOWLER}} dropped this one short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and bludgeons past the bowler, the fielder at long-off had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft once again! {{BATSMAN}} wants to finish this in a hurry. Slightly shorter this time, not much room but he plays is late with an open face. Gets it wide of Bairstow and short third man had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, great timing from {{BATSMAN}} as he whips this delivery backward of square. Back of a length on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} climbs onto it. A boundary at the start of his innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that might just ease {{BATSMAN}}. Full and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} stays back but leans forward and clips it wide of mid-on, Ashwin's dive is not good enough to stop the ball and it races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hammered! Fractionally short and that's enough for {{BATSMAN}} to take it on, Goes on the front foot to launch the pull over mid-on. Gets it well wide and also comfortably over the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, not off the bat but {{TEAM}} won't mind. Was angling in on leg stump and {{BATSMAN}} shuffled early for the flick. Off the pads and races away down to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, once again {{BATSMAN}} advances down the track, {{BOWLER}} saw that and shortened his length. It was slower as well. But, {{BATSMAN}} is well equipped. Despite not getting to the pitch of the ball, he holds his shape and lifts it over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, did that carry? No it didn't! Kohli is not happy as the ball escaped for four. The fielder didn't do much wrong there. He went for the catch and it landed just in front him. {{BATSMAN}} swept uppishly towards backward square leg and got away with it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, breaks the barrier of respect and drives it on the up, uppishly. Over cover and into the fence. The ball was in the zone and the batsman did not hold back to smack it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, read the batsman changing his grip and fired in a quicker delivery at 107ks, {{BATSMAN}} still adjusted and reverse swept it past a diving Lynn at backward point. It was a tentative dive from the Australian\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Sanju wasting no time, gets going with a first-ball boundary. Latches on to the length delivery and pulls it through mid-wicket without much hassle, beats the sprinter in the deep quite convincingly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the gamble hasn't paid off. A wicket was scalped, but the overall result - 22 runs off the 19th over. Flipper outside off, {{BATSMAN}} crouches and lifts it inside out. No chance for long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} takes on his former statemate. Stretches across outside off, gets under this flighted delivery and lofts it over cover. Excellent execution!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sets himself up for a slower delivery and clobbers the off-cutter over the fielder at extra cover, excellent timing and placement from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed. Too full and {{BATSMAN}} used his levers to bullet it past the umpire. Who did well to get out of the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drags the mighty heave from around off. For a moment he seemed to have found mid-wicket. But it was in the gap between mid-wicket and mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary of IPL 2018, first runs of the tournament as well, on a good length and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}}'s feet went nowhere as he extended his arms on the drive, hits it in the air and through the gap at extra-cover, no one moved\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a full toss. First up. Dictates terms right away does {{BATSMAN}} with a lean forward in whipping it through the on-side. Quite a warm up this\n",
            "Na{{BATSMAN}}em to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hat-trick of fours! Na{{BATSMAN}}em is clueless against AB at the moment. He tosses this up wi{{BATSMAN}} - the best thing he can think off - but AB still walks across and powers the sweep through square leg. Crowd going wild\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that a top shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Stands tall and admires the punch through covers. The fielder had no chance of stopping those. 6runs off 2overs from {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the carnage. {{BOWLER}} loses it down leg, the last hit has mentally scarred him. And is mowed away, fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bang! {{BATSMAN}} strikes them really hard. {{BOWLER}} missed the yorker length by a good couple of inches, {{BATSMAN}} pumps the drive straight down the ground. Rocketed to the fence and beat long-off with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, almost.. {{BOWLER}} overcorrects his length, bowls fuller this time. {{BATSMAN}} flexes his arms and lifts it over mid-off. Just clears the fielders and runs away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, a juicy full-toss from {{BOWLER}}, might have slipped out of his hands. {{BATSMAN}} was startled as he pushed at that, gets a thick edge that rolls away past the keeper and into the fence. An immediate apology from {{BOWLER}}, but that wasn't dangerous\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fabulous shot! It was the wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} picked it right out of the hand. Got into position to play the inside out shot and struck it handsomely over extra cover. The timing was exquisite\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the length is great on this one but the line is awful. On the legs of {{BATSMAN}} and he whips it through backward of square leg. Now they have got the four, need to make it count\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, it was the slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, rolled his fingers across the seam. {{BATSMAN}} watched it all along, played with an open face and guides it in the gap behind square on the off-side, beats backward point and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there is deep square leg, there is deep mid-wicket but {{BATSMAN}} has expertly split them both with a well timed pull shot. {{BOWLER}} went normal pace on this short ball and it didn't rise high enough for {{BATSMAN}} to be troubled\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, right up there! Brilliant delivery and equally well played. Opened the face of the blade and dug it out to squeeze the ball past the dive of the man at short third for a four. {{TEAM}} need more of these\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the initial call from {{BATSMAN}} was \"two\". Even he didn't know how well he had timed it. Full toss just outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, which is caressed through extra cover. Rahane at sweeper had given up the chase quite early\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sloppy, slippy! KL Rahul, the culprit. {{BATSMAN}} drove this flighted {{BATSMAN}}livery all along the ground to the left of long-off. There was no need to sli{{BATSMAN}}, but KL does that and over-does - courtesy {{BATSMAN}}w? In the end, he could only watch the ball go past the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 122.6kph, back of a length, slow, but there's width, generous width. {{BATSMAN}} stays on his back foot, and cuts away through point, beating third man comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, horror start for {{BOWLER}}. Drags it short first up, ample time for {{BATSMAN}} to rock back and pick his spot. Chooses cow corner and dismisses from his sight\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunched off the middle! Full pitcher in the zone outside off and {{BATSMAN}} just leans into the drive while slotting it in the gap through extra cover, raced away!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball alright, but this is way outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} delays the cut shot, puts it past backward point and the man sweeping the off-side boundary could not cut it off as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and that is an usual sight. {{BOWLER}} throws it full outside off, might have swung a bit. But how does it matter, {{BATSMAN}} flays the drive uppishly through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fired down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} gets down on one knee and sweeps it fine past the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clean and over mid-off. The same delivery that got Saha, but {{BATSMAN}} is in and seeing it well tonight by the looks of it. Goes over mid-off with a full bat-swing and clears the fielder comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air and that's the first boundary of the innings! The knuckle ball on a shortish length, {{BATSMAN}} walks down the track and pulls it over mid-wicket. There is no one in the deep and the ball races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fittingly a {{BATSMAN}} signature cover drive to finish the game. He's been fantastic tonight and has calmly ensured an easy win for {{TEAM}}. Overcooked from {{BOWLER}} and it's been creamed away off the front foot. Long-off had no chance of cutting it off. {{TEAM}} return to winning ways\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy pickings! Full toss and a lot of width outside off as well, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't even need these gifts in the kind of form that he is in tonight. Absolutely feasts on it with a slice through backward point. Sweeper had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} connects and finds the gap at deep extra cover. Another full and widish delivery from {{BOWLER}} outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat and crunches it in the gap to collect a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tickled away fine as that was the quicker ball. Has run away to the fence for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and cut away now. Slight bit of room from {{BOWLER}} and the batsman hammers the cut to the right of the point fielder for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, bonus runs! They all count though. Pacy delivery on leg stump, was a freebie in every sense and though {{BATSMAN}} couldn't get bat on the flick, it brushes the pad and splits the keeper and short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and fractionally wide, {{BATSMAN}} has a lower and wide stance and has a solid base to execute the perfect cut shot to deep backward point for four. Unbelievable...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short one at the body, {{BATSMAN}} hasn't opened up his stance, finds himself in an awkward position, knows he'll be late on it, and goes for a blind hook - gets bat on it and deflects it away towards fine leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, such awareness from {{BATSMAN}}, sees the mid-off is inside the ring, makes room and lofts over him so nonchalantly. A couple of bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, aggression written all over that shot! Pitched up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} brings his bat down in a jiffy and lofts it over the leaping man at mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top-edge and over the keeper. Sometimes extra pace can let you down but {{BOWLER}} shouldn't mind this. Bouncer, rearing off the deck and {{BATSMAN}} for the nth time tries the pull and gets a top-edge to his favour\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracks away a pull shot. Who said he's not good with the short balls. Rises in sync with the height on this short delivery and pumps it through square leg. Another great shot today from the master\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, phew! That was close. Shortish, again slightly turning in and the cut is played off the top-half of the bat. The man at backward point leapt up but still could not even get finger-tips to it. 10 runs of the over and {{TEAM}} fight on thanks to this cameo from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} ends a decent spell - 4-0-29-1\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a poor start from {{BOWLER}}, short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} waited on that, played with an open face and beat Mujeeb's dive at short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} inches closer to another IPL ton. Wide full toss and there aren't many worse deliveries to bowl to a set batsman. Especially with third man in the ring. {{BATSMAN}} slices it away, well wide of the fielder in the ring and away she goes to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is better. Will make him feel better, this shot. Makes room and punches the length delivery through extra-cover. No fielder in the deep as {{BATSMAN}} collects his second boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full a ball on off. Cannot be termed a poor ball but the brilliance of {{BATSMAN}}. Opens the bat-face at the last moment and squeezes it square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hunts the fence. Much needed this for the Punjabis. Takes it off the pads and brings out the broom as he sweeps it this away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wide half-volley outside off, {{BATSMAN}} has his feet glued to the turf and lofts it towards sweeper cover for four. Lands about a centimeter short of the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, his eyes were wi{{BATSMAN}} open as {{BOWLER}} was running in, maybe he was waiting for the short ball. Mur{{BATSMAN}}red through mid-wicket. That's actually so disrespectful to a fast bowler, but this is a tough game\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, angled in, was that armer, towards leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} came down the wicket, realized he wasn't to the pitch of it, but still went through with the shot Through deep mid-wicket for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} waits for it, gets on top of the bounce and slaps it over mid-off. The fielder was inside the ring and he just had to clear him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it was in the arc for {{BATSMAN}} and he dispatched it for a boundary. {{BOWLER}} after bowling brilliant slower ones decides to bowl a yorker. He fails to get the yorker right, {{BATSMAN}} gets under and powers it wide of long-off. It rockets to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sliced in the air, the bat turned on impact there. But {{BATSMAN}} will still get four. He can't do much wrong tonight. Backs away a touch to what was probably a slower ball and is able to place it wide of long-off, the ball turning away from the fielder further after bouncing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, uppish, but not convincing. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} chips it over the infield, more towards square leg, luckily for the visitors, the ball went in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air and just over the leaping mid-on fielder. {{BATSMAN}} is early into the pick up shot, more of a leading edge and the ball balloons over a backtracking mid-on fielder. The practice wickets take care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! This is a cruel game. Krishna deceived the batsman with a good slower delivery, {{BATSMAN}} was through the shot and the outside edge bisects Karthik and short third man perfectly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is playing a blinder for Punjab. Sees a short ball, backs away and bludgeons it powerfully wide of long-on. Evades the fielder comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, why worry when you can play shots like these? Walks well across his stumps and meets the ball with greatest of ease, chips the punchy on-drive over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has had enough of pushing and prodding, makes room to a good length delivery and hoicks - off the thick inside edge and past square leg, runs away to the ropes in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slips through slip's hands! A fraction short, very little width, {{BATSMAN}}'s teenage upper body tries a cut, gets a top-edge that flies over Suryakumar Yadav at slip, as he gets a fingertip to it. Away to third man for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sheer timing from {{BATSMAN}}, back of a length and on the hips, he gets inside the line and clips it past square leg, the timing is sweet and the ball runs away to the boundary ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has decided to play his shots in the powerplay. The ball was come on nicely and that is the best time to score. Dances down and lofts it straight back over {{BOWLER}}, Gowtham does well to get across from long-on and get a hand to it, but the ball still rolls into the ad cushions\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, well, this is clever batting frm {{BATSMAN}}. He's too good with the dinks. Again picks the length delivery, gets deep in his crease and opens his bat face at the last minute to glide it past Bairtsow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fuller, wider, squeezed, four! Bowls it quick and full, the quicker hands of the batter come into play and squirt the ball past point for a four. Much needed one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smartly played by {{BATSMAN}}! Gets down on one knee and paddles the full legbreak in the gap through short fine, Siraj puts in a dive after a long sprint but ball wins the race\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and it keeps getting better. Rocks back, stands tall, waits for the short drag down to sit up and swats in his swivel. All the crunch in the timing to reintroduce it back into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's risk involved but he has to take all that is on offer. {{BATSMAN}} reverse sweeps this full ball to place it between short third man and backward point. This is his first fifty of the seaons. Will it be in a winning cause?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, right in the sweeping zone for SD. He gets inside the line and thrashes it away behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, piles it on. With the width not enough to force matters in the off-side, {{BATSMAN}} takes it into the other side of the pitch. Another back of a length this from {{BOWLER}} looking to cramp him up for room and responded with a flat bat this time. Barely bothers to keep it down either, gets it in front of the man looking to cut it off at mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 140.7kph. There's the crunch. {{BOWLER}} gets a little too greedy, going short without a lot of pace and {{BATSMAN}}'s ready for it, bringing out a short arm jab to smack it into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, {{BATSMAN}} is on a mission - back of a length and well wide of off, he swivels across and pulls it in front of square on the on-side - one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is how he started against Na{{BATSMAN}}em. Went bang bang. This is a top top shot. {{BOWLER}} loops it up on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and opens his body to go insi{{BATSMAN}} out over extra cover. That's tra{{BATSMAN}}mark AB\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, premeditates the reverse, and knows third man is inside to sweep it neatly over him, perfectly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slogged away off a length ball towards the deep mid-wicket fence but does not matter. DD win this by 55 runs. This has been a superb show from DD, ably led by their new skipper - Shreyas Iyer. Two vital points and {{TEAM}} have been jolted badly by this\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} being cheeky. He telegraphed his ploy very early, {{BATSMAN}} shuffled across to get inside the line and scoop it over short fine. He generated enough power to clear the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh, better. {{BOWLER}} - with more pace - and with more in the slot. Wide, outside off, {{BATSMAN}} moves away, sits down on a knee and carves it away into third man, almost all the way too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and that wasn't timed! Off the inner half of the bat and the ball escapes into the gap between deep square and deep mid for a four. Poor delivery and was put away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} not impressed, either by the effort from the keeper, or by {{BATSMAN}}'s attempt at a pull. {{BATSMAN}} is rushed by this short of length ball and sends an outside edge past the diving Ojha into the third man boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that was pitched halfway down the track, AB hammers it with brute power over mid-wicket. Hadn't got the timing right, but he did well to place it in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, great crack of the bat as {{BATSMAN}} crunched this flat-batted swipe wide of deep midwicket. {{BOWLER}}'s slower ball was short in length and sat up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stands tall in the crease and flat-bats a shortish delivery straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} makes the most of the free-hit. {{BOWLER}} is not impressed. Very full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends down and uses the pace of the bowler to squeeze it behind point. No chance for third man to cut that off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} are going well here. {{BATSMAN}} talked about intent after their loss against RPS. He and Gayle are showing it. Bouncer, {{BATSMAN}} walks across and pulls it very fine. The fine leg fielder was very fine and he had no chance there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} too meted out with the same treatment. Good length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans into the drive and places it square. It is a crowded off-side field and he's threaded that to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, consecutive boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}. That should calm the nerves. Overpitched and {{BOWLER}} is punished, {{BATSMAN}} strides forward and creams the square drive through the packed off-side field. No need to run for that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now {{BOWLER}} fires it short and {{BATSMAN}} goes back to punch it through the covers. What a blistering start for {{TEAM}}! 16 off the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, short of a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} made room for himself and clattered it over cover, no one moved and that brings up {{TEAM}}'s 50\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, make that 20 off the over. {{BATSMAN}} has raced off to 40 in no-time. A real dart on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} milks it off his pads. Easy peasy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has come out firing. Picked the length early on the short of length delivery, got his front leg up and nailed the pull in front of square. That came smack bang off the middle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliance to end in some sloppiness. A punishing drive this from {{BATSMAN}} through the covers and the other KP runs around, swoops and dives to cut off what was meant to be a certain boundary. But in his attempt to get up and throw has his back leg spike brush the boundary cushions. Oh dear, the misery gets worse\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful footwork from {{BATSMAN}}, so nimble. He's been in such sublime form. The length is short, which he picks in a flash, and pummels the pull through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is an ordinary over from {{BOWLER}}. 19 runs off it and he like Malinga has been expensive today. Full toss on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} says thank you very much and flicks it behind square leg. The man was up inside the ring and the ball was well away from him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Uses the width outside off and bounce and elevates it over backward point to collect his first boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, scores level! This is his night! Backs away and picks this up from leg-stump, opens the face and flays this between perfectly through the gap in the extra cover region for four! A dive at the boundary, but that won't save the boundary...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stand and deliver! No need to move, anyone. Stay put. Short in length around off, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and pulls it over mid-wicket. No fielders in the deep and that shall be four runs to end the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped short. AB makes it look much, much worse, rocking behind in the crease and then throwing his weight behind a tonked loft, splitting long-off and extra cover in the {{BATSMAN}}ep perfectly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back fifties for {{BATSMAN}}! A dolly of a delivery from Hardus {{BOWLER}}, sprayed into the pads and {{BATSMAN}} just puts bat to ball. Fine leg inside the ring and that's a easy boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, whipped away! Floated on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} is on his front foot to heave this one towards the deep mid-wicket fence. Played that in the air, but more importantly in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, Dhawan was the fielder at wide slip - dived to his right, but the ball was just wide of him. An awkward jab from {{BATSMAN}} as he pushed away from his body, didn't count for the extra bounce\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hammered! Clear intent from {{BATSMAN}} as he gives the charge and forces this length ball past the bowler. Well wide of mid-on and it speeds away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a cracking boundary to bring up the 50-run stand. Moves away, picks the length on the fuller one and lofts it well over mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a bad fumble from Rana and he has cost his team two runs. Full and on his pads, flicked away behind square on the on-side. Rana did the hard yards, got to the ball and slips it through his hands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Dhoni shouts Na na na from behind as it was a short one, it was wide of off too. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and cuts it wide of short third. Another boundary for {{BATSMAN}}!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, so he gets a pitched up delivery from {{BOWLER}} and drives a boundary away. Why not. Room outside off, half a stride to middle it and off she goes through covers!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, chopped, short of a good length and just outside off, too close for {{BATSMAN}} to play the cut, he gets a toe-edge and beats the lone slip, third man is square and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lucky, {{BATSMAN}} ain't complaining. The batsman goes for the big wild swing. The ball trims the outer half of the bat and flies over the man at short third man for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, full-toss on {{BATSMAN}}'s hips and all he had to do was to clip, he does so and beats the tumbling dive from Rahul Chahar - running across from fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a shot. {{BOWLER}} overdoes, overpitches and that's too easy for {{BATSMAN}}. Gets forward, with a full face of the bat and creams it past mid-on. That boundary will ruin a decent over by {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor line! Can't bowl such freebies when a batsman is in good touch. This was a shortish delivery on the thigh and all {{BATSMAN}} wanted to do is get it past the fielder at short fine leg, manages to do so. Drags it past the fielder and gets another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 16 runs off the opening over. Couldn't have asked for a better start. On the pads again and all {{BATSMAN}} does is clips it past the fielder at short fine leg, he dives there but the ball is too quick for him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the bowler is under pressure too here. Even someone as confident as {{BOWLER}}. He drops it short, allows {{BATSMAN}} to rock back and he belts it over square leg. Bounces just inside the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this wasn't timed as he would've liked, but {{BATSMAN}} will still earn a boundary. The slower {{BATSMAN}}livery from Fizz, {{BATSMAN}} didn't pick it as he was through the shot early. Still managed to get enough wood to place it over mid-on. There's no stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} looks at the base of his bat. He knows that it didn't come off the middle. Full toss outside off and {{BATSMAN}} swings it away in front of square on the leg-side, wide of the long-on fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overpitched from {{BOWLER}}, the over-correction from the bowler, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and plays a lovely off-drive to the left of mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, consecutive fours for {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} sprays it down leg, {{BATSMAN}} just gets a tickle on it and sends it very fine. Races away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nearly the season's screamer .. Samson covers good ground, flies, but no, he's not as genetically blessed as a Holder. So it was short, with no pace as usual and {{BATSMAN}}'s adjusted heave just can't be kept down. Luckily for him, it's a foot wide of deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done from {{BATSMAN}}! He was anticipating a slower one and it indeed was one, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, makes room and eases it past short third for a boundary. No need to run for that!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another back of a length ball, and just cross-batted disdainfully over the bowler's head for four. No respect!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 141.8kph, a bit of a top-edge in this swivel-pull, but palming over off Rabada's jump at the deep square leg boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball on off stump, which to be fair isn't that short as {{BATSMAN}}'s made it out to be. He collapses his back leg to get low and swats it wide of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor bowling from {{BOWLER}}. He has been all over the shop. Straying down leg and that is not where you bowl to {{BATSMAN}}, easy pickings for the Royals skipper as he glances it fine past the fielder at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flat delivery, skidding, {{BATSMAN}} gets low and swat-sweeps that to deep square leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot! First boundary of the innings. {{BATSMAN}} walks down the track and in the process moves leg-side, which allows him to free his arms. The length was on the shorter side and {{BATSMAN}} slapped it away over wide mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length delivery just outside off and has been whipped from there. Difficult shot to call but was a hybrid of the helicopter that his brother had played a few balls back. Bisected the gap between deep square and deep mid\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Elegant. {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across a long way and flicks this full ball around off very fine. No chance for the man at short fine leg. The ball reached the fence in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the airrrrrr and just over the leaping Maxwell at mid-on. {{BATSMAN}} is known for his audacious stroke-play. He won't mind playing his shots in any situation. Shortish delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} smacks that from the crease, didn't get hold of it, more a sort of a pull shot it was, the ball just evaded the Punjab skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length delivery rising steeply outside off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and tries carving it away through the point regio, gets a massive top-edge over slip for a boundary to third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot! {{BATSMAN}} backed away even before the ball was delivered and that allowed him to free his arms. It was darted outside off and {{BATSMAN}} crashed it through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! Another away-turner and {{BATSMAN}} cut hard from the crease. Gets a fat edge that eludes first slip and runs away to third man for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it is getting from bad to worse for {{BOWLER}}. And finally, something to cheer for the Royals fans. It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets underneath it and pumps it wide of cover for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the slip was there for {{BATSMAN}}'s first ball. But he was taken off for this one and guess what the ball goes right through that gaping hole. Good delivery from {{BOWLER}}, hitting a length and getting bounce, the edge was found but there was no-one to catch and it runs away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, chops the cut away off the back foot and gets it past the man at point for a four. {{TEAM}} are racing away towards the target. 42 needed now. Dropped it slightly short and {{BATSMAN}} was quick to pounce on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! This has been a morale-boosting over for Punjab. Banged short, at the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} is too strong to miss out. Pulls it witheringly to the cow corner fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 139.5kph, full toss. {{BATSMAN}} slices, has his bat turning in his palms, but still has enough in it to chip it over extra cover, and beat Rashid's sliding dive from sweeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, such strong bottom hand! Wow! This kid certainly packs a punch, doesn't he? Fired fuller by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} was on the charge, adjusts to drill it powerfully past the bowler. Long-on had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finally a boundary of {{BATSMAN}}! That'll give him some relief. This was short one on leg, {{BATSMAN}} does well to drag it down to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, controlled aggression from Rishabh {{BATSMAN}}! Sits on one knee, picks the legbreak and sweeps it in the gap between deep square and deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} misses his length horribly this time. It was a slower nut on the stumps and was a full-toss, {{BATSMAN}} moves to the off-side and half-scoops it fine of short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's crashed into the fence. Full length delivery on the stumps and {{BATSMAN}} won't stop himself from clearing his front foot and nailing one to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Even though it is Delhi, the crowd are up on their feet to applaud the knock. {{BATSMAN}} acknowledges it with a wave of the bat. The slower length delivery, heaved in front of square, bisecting the two men in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, from round the wicket, tossed up and {{BATSMAN}} has smote it back over {{BOWLER}}'s head. Flat hit and bisects long-off and long-on. Super shot. He is continuing his stroke-making\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more clumsy effort from RR in the field. Gopal, the guilty culprit this time, who lets it through. {{BATSMAN}} moved across on this occasion and helped this short of length delivery to short fine leg. Gopal was lazy to bend low and didn't get his body behind the line of the ball. Sneaked through his legs and off to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a good shot. But he looks at his bat. Not entirely happy with the connection. Saw the tossed up delivery and charged {{BOWLER}}, to the pitch and lofted wide and over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has seen enough of this good length stuff from {{BOWLER}}. Decides to score a boundary, plays across the line and chips it over mid-wicket, splits deep mid-wicket and long-on to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back fours for {{BATSMAN}}. He's getting a move on. {{BOWLER}} overcorrects and slips in the slower short ball, {{BATSMAN}} waits and pulls it after twirling his wrists behind square. Big gap and he will earn a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is in his elements today, slower short ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} picked the length early and found the gap past cover-point with the cut\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, carved over cover, which Pooran chases and appears to have pulled back at the boundary. But no, he isn't all that good, for when his fingers are on the ball, his elbow's on the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} exploits the field. Too short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} quickly shifts his weight back and punches it past Bhajji at cover, who gaves a desperate chase but the ball wins the race\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, kind of a shot Jonny would salivate upon for days! It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} takes a good stride forward and creams it through cover for a boundary. Another 50-run wasy partnership for Jonny and Warner. It's an easy game for them at the moment\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 142.9km/h, back of a length delivery angling into the hips, tucked away with fabulous timing towards the cow corner fence for four. Harshal Patel's valiant effort at the boundary in vain...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first ball from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} takes the seam-up delivery and sweeps it through backward square leg, hit well and found the gap too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the short ball didn't work against Agarwal.. it almost did against {{BATSMAN}}. Hits him high on the bat as he pulls. No control as it flies to the left of Krunal but he can't get to it at long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's almost gone all the way! {{BATSMAN}} lost his balance on this shot, which isn't unusual as we know but this is still outrageous to pull off. Swivels across on the pull and skies it in the air down the leg-side. Too fine though and the fine leg fielder could only watch it land in front of the ropes and brisk away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short, {{BATSMAN}} pulls it down the ground over the mid-off fielder for a four. Shouts of catch were there but it was well away from the fielder. Even long-on tried to cut it off but couldn't\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, touch quicker and {{BOWLER}} also gives width outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stays low and plays the square drive really late, the timing was such that the fielder from sweeper couldn't get across to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very full, {{BATSMAN}} crunches a drive between extra cover and mid-off. Really hit it hard and gets another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and the covers again. It wasn't all that full, and {{BATSMAN}}'s going through with what's more a punch this time, and the rest is the same (2.4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top shot! Not much gap between backward point and short third man but {{BATSMAN}} has found it. To begin with, there wasn't any width on offer as {{BOWLER}} darted this around off, the southpaw still managed to get the cut away. Bhajji is not amused\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, dropped it short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it and cuts it hard, beats backward point to his left and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finally {{BATSMAN}} gets off the mark. Was waiting for a loose delivery and he has latched onto it with both hands. Throws the kitchen sink at this short and wide ball and cuts it over backward point as the fielder in the deep couldn't do nothing about it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, three boundaries off the over and 16 came from it, too short and too wide from {{BOWLER}}, can't bowl those lengths with third man in the ring, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and clears the fielder with the cut, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, premeditated. {{BATSMAN}} shuffled across early and {{BOWLER}} smartly dragged his length back, {{BATSMAN}} still went through with his paddle and got the faintest of connection to beat Buttler to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft! {{BATSMAN}} camps deep inside the crease and steers the ball with softest of touches as he opens the bat face at the right moment. Needed a dive from Narine at short third man, he is just lazing around\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft touch from {{BATSMAN}}! Spotted the length of this flat delivery early and opened the bat face at the last minute to guide it past Bairstow's gloves fine of third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, tossed up just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to bend down, rolls his wrists and then plays the reverse sweep - past short third man and runs away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is in a hurry here. Wasting no time as he backs away to this back of a length delivery and bullies it through the packed off-side field. Not so productive start for {{BOWLER}} and DD\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just over a diving Pollard at backward point! Was shortish and a hint of room which {{BATSMAN}} pounced on with a flashing cut. Clears the infield, just, to get the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss, plenty of room on offer and Yuvi flays it away square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR. Help-me please. Leg-side fodder, {{BATSMAN}} tickles it fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary of the innings. Sweetly timed by {{BATSMAN}}. Saw the ball dropped on a shortish length, pivoted back and flayed it through cover. This is a mickey-mouse outfield and it zooms away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sloppy work from Finch. A crisp drive to the left of mid-off, Finchy was late to react and hence the dive came in late, gets some hand on it, but ends up parrying it to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}}'s game keeps getting better and better! Employs one of the best tactics to play spin. Gets down on one knee and swats the reverse sweep from outside off, right in the gap behind point, sweeper cover can't get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that should have been stopped by Rahul Chahar at deep point. Short and wide outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} cuts, Chahar got there running to his left from sweeper, but he fumbled\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now {{BATSMAN}} skips out of the crease, takes it on the full and drills it through extra-cover. Back to back boundaries\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} picks the leg-cutter on this occasion. Took a stride forward, opened his bat face and flayed it past point. Sweeper cover fielder couldn't get across and it runs away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's sloppy from Narine, should have been stopped. Again {{BATSMAN}} fails to time the ball, this was a good length delivery that rushed, the ball took the inside edge of the bat and escaped wide of mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, timed! That's what you get with class players like {{BATSMAN}}. Just stands his ground, waits for the fullish delivery to arrive and chips the drive over cover with an air of confidence. All the way...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superb batting this from {{BATSMAN}}! Waits for the full delivery to land and just opens the bat face at the last instant to send it between the keeper and short third. Deft!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fullish and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slices it over the infield. The carnage continues. {{BOWLER}} just doesn't know where to bowl to {{BATSMAN}} and he concedes 26 runs in the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's no mercy in the world for things that're short. In cricket too. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and smashes the pull through square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tries to land it on a length and is greeted with a drive on the up. Lovely timing and placement on it takes it away to the fence. {{BATSMAN}} is away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superb shot! It is not easy to hit {{BOWLER}}'s slower balls. But {{BATSMAN}} does it superbly. Just delayed his shot and lofted the full off-cutter over extra cover. The placement was also perfect as he got it wide of sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and flat outside off, sliced away in the gap between point and cover point for a four. The room was there and the batsman chased that widish ball to put it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries, short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of the bounce and cuts it up and over backward point - third man is fine and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's nicely done. Goes back in the crease, picks the length early on the short one and helps it down to the fine leg fence. Short third tried hard to cut it down but it's a lightning quick outfield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, a rare bad ball from KKR tonight, a floaty half-volley outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans into the shot, finds the gap past cover and watches it roll away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, presses forward causing the bowler to shorten his length, quickly transfers his weight onto the back foot and spanks the pull through mid-wicket. {{BOWLER}} didn't get a lot of height with that and it sat up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not an ideal start for Imran {{BOWLER}} in this IPL. Too full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slammed it straight of long-off where DJ Bravo fumbles after putting a desperate dive to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shuffles across to a ball that's straying on leg stump and helps it fine for four. What an over this is turning out to be for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, spots the slower off-cutter. And ensures to dispatch it away. Tries to fox him with the loopy bouncer here does {{BOWLER}} but a walk across to pull it past the man at short fine does the job\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shortish and skiddy outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets low and slices that away to deep backward point for four. Perfect placement behind backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, sublime timing on that one from {{BATSMAN}}, it wasn't anything more than a back-foot punch. This was a back of a length delivery outside off, he got on top of the bounce and placed it in the gap past point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, they are just feeding to his strengths. Full ball on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} picks it up and kills it over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, past Gowtham's dive. Lands the slower delivery in a fullish range, Mo with a readymade clear of his front leg pumps it straight down the ground, the wet outfield makes the ball skid off the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done. He's played this so late and so delicately, using all the pace that {{BOWLER}} has to offer. Darted in on a back of a length just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans back and dabs it fine of short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superb stroke! Punched off the middle, don't move! Uses the crease to adjust his feet movements as he unveils it in the gap between cover and point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stands outside leg stump and thumps this in the gap between backward point and cover. Made room early and cuts the quicker delivery in the gap on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a gift. Full and down leg, {{BATSMAN}} glances it off his pads and off she goes...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he is on the charge, is {{BATSMAN}}. He doesn't want to let this opportunity of a crushing win slip. Charges down the track and makes some room for this good length delivery. Slaps it away over point comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, {{BATSMAN}} is off and running in his IPL career. On a good length and just outside off, he leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and drives it back past the non-striker, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans back a touch and slices the drive behind point. The height on that seemed a bit touch-and-go but guess the umpire got it right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another off-pace {{BOWLER}}livery - 111.5kph. The skipper picks it, gets down on a knee and swipes it over square leg. There's no one in the {{BOWLER}}ep there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, {{BATSMAN}} is getting into the act now, slower and just outside off, he gets forward, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and finds the gap past extra-cover, beats mid-off and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot again. Makes room as he charges out and clouts it inside-out over extra cover. He'll keep doing that all day\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fine start for {{TEAM}} as the 50 comes up! A long hop down the leg side and {{BATSMAN}} drags it past the fielder at short fine leg. Struggling with his lines is {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, okay now a few runs for the luck brigade. Nicely snaking up and a desperate/compulsive pull takes the top edge and flies in no man's land. Over the keeper's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bisected Ishan Kishan and wide slip to perfection. The off-cutter from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} read it early, waited back in his crease, opened the bat face and glided it right between the two fielders\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too straight and with {{BOWLER}}'s inward angle it becomes all the more easy. Easily deflected to the fine leg fence, the man in that region is in the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good looking shot. Jogs down the track, gets to the pitch and lofts it over mid-on. The man at deep mid-wicket runs across, but couldn't stop it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 138.1km/h, a full-blooded drive through the vacant extra cover region! A good length delivery in the zone, angling in, and not much wrong with it, {{BATSMAN}} takes a small step forward and drives it through the line towards the deep extra cover fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now through the other side. A floater up on off, takes matters with the turn does {{BATSMAN}}, with a full-blooded inside-out drive. Doesn't even bother keeping it down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very straight, {{BATSMAN}} kneels down and pulls it along the ground through square leg, no protection in the deep. Looked like the ball came off the inside half of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball at the head, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across nicely and helps the pull away to the fine leg boundary. Just one more needed. What a late assault\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, the slower ball and {{BATSMAN}} picked it, backed away and lifts it over mid-off, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball and the swivelled pull. Picks up the length quickly and pivots on his back foot to send it speeding towards the backward square region for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Archer is disappointed with himself. Overpitched flighted delivery and {{BATSMAN}} drills the drive straight down the ground, Archer gets across from long-on and tries to stop it with one hand, the ball does not stick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, thumped! {{BATSMAN}} picks the slower delivery, maintains a good base by going deep in the crease and whips it with a lot of bottom hand to wide long-on, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} are away in a fine fashion. He takes a huge stride forward. Comes close to the ball and sweeps it like a boss. It goes over backward square leg and thuds into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fabulous shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Rides the bounce and cracks a solid punch that breaches the crowded off-side field. Races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fullish ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} opens the bat-face at the very last moment and runs it down to third man. Got it very fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, looked like the googly and {{BATSMAN}} threw everything at it. Loses shape and fails to make contact, the ball sneaks past the inside edge and races past the keeper in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nothing wrong on this occasion from {{BATSMAN}}. Saw the length on the shorter side, quickly rocked back and cut it ferociously beating the cover fielder to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky, but {{TEAM}} won't mind. The knuckle ball on a fuller length, {{BATSMAN}} had the width to free his arms, throws everything he's got and squirts it off the outside edge behind point, right between backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss around the knee roll, {{BATSMAN}} stays still and flicks it over the square leg umpire. No need to run for those...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, up and over! Haven't seen {{BATSMAN}} be aggressive this early in this season but this shot perhaps shows a change in mindset. Slight fuller from {{BOWLER}} and it's lofted straight back over his head. Clean connection and gets the result\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dismissed to the boundary by AB. Short of length, bounces only as high as the chest and the pull shot is swatted away backward of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, this is good batting from {{BATSMAN}}, he's beginning to read {{BOWLER}} now, tossed up on the stumps, he gets well forward and lifts it back over the bowler's head, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top-edge and it runs away to the fence. {{BATSMAN}} was in no control there. Sharp bouncer around the left shoulder, {{BATSMAN}} was late on the hook and hence the edge, flies right over Philippe. He then practices playing the ramp instead of the hook\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, is this the over? Just a glimmer of width on that short one, and {{BATSMAN}} hops, slaps it away through the gap to deep extra cover for four! Incredible shot!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a full toss now. With all the men inside the circle at mid-off, even a miscue catching the toe-end of the bat in the extravagant drive means a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, little short outside off and the batsman latches on to it. Smokes the cut past point and the ball reaches the ropes. These are useful runs on the board\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets this away! This is the man standing between MI and victory. Short of length at the body, {{BATSMAN}} nails the pull backward of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes back to the shortish length and takes the pace off as well, {{BATSMAN}} pulls and is a touch early into the shot, the bottom hand comes off but the ball is in the gap, wide of deep mid-wicket and four more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh superbly guided away past point and he thanks the heavens again. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} uses the pace on the ball and beats third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and here's the overcompensated rubbish to follow up the ripper. Drifting well down leg, very full too .. and swept away firmly behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, why on earth would you bowl short and wide to anyone? {{BATSMAN}} treks and allows the hands to take over. Carved over point for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ah! That should have been a single. A fierceful - let's make words! - sweep shot from {{BATSMAN}} that goes through square leg. The Big Mitch in the deep can't stop it as the ball spin away from him. He didn't anticipate that and wen the wrong way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another edge and {{BATSMAN}} escapes this time. Hands on the head for SRH's fielders. It was pitched up outside off, {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes light up as he goes hard on the drive. No feet, just hands following the ball. Thick outside edge beats Bairstow to his left - who dived but it was far from him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full this time from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} lofts over mid-off. {{BOWLER}} is bleeding here and {{BATSMAN}} has raced to 31 off 13\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery, too much time for {{BATSMAN}} on the back foot. Was short and he pummelled the pull between deep square and deep mid. Perfect placement\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, fraction too full and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} lunges across and then plays a cross-batted swipe past cover, the fielder in the deep at long-off is very square and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and again. {{BOWLER}} has 58 against his name. A full delivery hoping to veer into the blockhole and {{BATSMAN}} digs it out with the bat gaining all the momentum to be imparted with a smash past the bowler. Long-off doesn't even want to take the effort in chasing this. Futile I tell you\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tell you what, his touch is back. It was fuller and {{BATSMAN}} creams it wide of Rohit at cover. He wasn't far from the ball but it was hit very hard and will canter to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bonus runs for {{TEAM}}, exacly what they want. Very rarely, a bowler of {{BOWLER}}'s caliber delivers a morsel like this. It was down the leg-side and {{BATSMAN}} just helps it to the the fine-leg fence with a flick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! This is where {{BOWLER}} needs to learn. He bowls a pacy yorker outside off and {{BATSMAN}} squirts an outside edge past Parthiv Patel. He has to take pace off on this slower surface\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky runs! Terrific end to what has been a sensational over from {{BOWLER}}. On a good length just outside off, 143.7kph and {{BATSMAN}} was late on the forward push. Got a thick inside edge that just flew past leg stump and with fine leg really square, bonus runs for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a repeat of the previous delivery. This time though he had to fetch it from well outside off and beats Stokes's dive to his right at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, shimmies down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it back over the bowler's head, a couple of bounces and over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's easy for {{BATSMAN}}! Bowls short and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lets his lovely hands take over. Crisply punched through covers. CYA LATER\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slides this way too wide outside off and {{BATSMAN}} reaches out to dab it away for his first boundary. Hasn't been himself today, maybe this will get him going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, consecutive fours for {{BATSMAN}}. He's started to up the ante. Gets low, takes it in front of the stumps and slog-sweeps it powerfully in front of square. Threads the gap at deep mid-wicket and collects a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, it was deliberate from {{BATSMAN}}, but was too close for comfort. Short of a good length and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} played with an open face and dabs it past Gayle at slip, rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not where he intended, but that should relieve some pressure. The cross-seam back of a length delivery delivery, {{BATSMAN}} heaves and the inside edge goes behind square on the leg-side, Shami had no chance in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} hits the winning boundary! Treks back and drags the short ball into the gap at cow corner. No fielders in the deep and Rajasthan Royals beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 7 wickets to spice up the points table\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air....safe and to the fence! Was a lofted hit from {{BATSMAN}} and he got more height than distance on the stroke. Long-on and {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket were converging on the stroke but with no real chance of getting to it. The former, Mayank, tried in vain as it lan{{BATSMAN}}d short of him and to the fence. 50 for QDK! Super knock so far\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short in length around off, {{BATSMAN}} treks back in his crease and slams it over extra cover for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} switches to round the wicket to finish the over. Does not bring about a change in fortunes, drifts down the leg and {{BATSMAN}} helps it past the keeper. In fact between the keeper and the man at short fine leg with a whippish pull. That is what I saw, the umpire saw things differently and correctly. Given as leg-byes, must have come off thigh or something else\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, handy runs! Looks to smash it away and the ball runs away off the outer edge for a four. 7 more needed now. He wanted to smack it out of the park but ended up edging it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} decides to get a move on. On the shorter side from {{BOWLER}} and it's leg stumpish as well. Pulled away through the gap between mid-wicket and mid-on. Races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, a touch of class from {{BATSMAN}} - overpitched and well wide of off, he leant into the drive, opened the bat-face at the last moment and sliced the drive behind square on the off-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh well, put the mockers on him there. But again, as soon as he tries to pitch the ball up expecting it to swing, he ends up on the pads. Whipped away gloriously from {{BATSMAN}} over square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Rahul, Agarwal and now {{BATSMAN}}. All Karnataka boys have got off the mark with a boundary or six tonight. Full length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} keeps his head still and drills it past the fielder at mid-off, no chance to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets a full delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} picks the field change (long-on moved to mid-on for this delivery) and whips it with flair over the ring on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50 up for {{TEAM}}! In a quick time. This was a pacy good length ball on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} helps it along its way to fine leg. Runs coming thick and fast for the hosts\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is great awareness from {{BATSMAN}}. Saw mid-off was up and wanted to get this past the fielder. Backed away for the flat-batted stroke and although he didn't get a big chunk of this, still had enough to beat the diving fielder in the circle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and wide, sliced away backwards of point. Excellent timing and even better placement from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good finish to the over. {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker by a couple of inches and that is enough for {{BATSMAN}} to tonk it back over him, one bounce and evades the long-on fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, aggression from the bowler, the batsman not one to back off. Goes for the hook on the short ball, the ball kisses the gloves and goes over the keeper for a four. Lucky is {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misses the mark again and overcompensates with a full toss. That was helped on its way over the short fine fielder. {{BATSMAN}} hasn't been missing anything though. Anything in his range has been disappearing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh poor delivery. He's fired this well down leg, {{BATSMAN}} sees the opportunity early and paddle-swats it to the fine leg boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh lovely shot. What hand-eye coordination! His feet didn't move a great deal as he creamed the length ball on the up through cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now this is rubbish. Rank long hop and down leg as well, {{BATSMAN}} helps it along the way with a pull over short fine, this is just brilliant batting from the duo\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, up and over! Cannot bowl this length in the Powerplay, not on a true surface like this one. Half-volley and {{BATSMAN}} lifts it straight over the bowler's head. Perhaps not middled as much as he would have liked but still got enough on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, through Dhoni and that runs away into the fence. Very rare from MS. It was the googly from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} tries another lofted shot. Is nowhere close to the bat and misses. Was marginally outside the tramline as well. Brushed the CSK skipper's pad and that's four bonus runs for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's two delicate shots from {{BATSMAN}} for two boundaries. He waits for the ball to turn away, opens the bat face and runs it past short third man. The pace of {{BOWLER}} takes care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Chahar goes for the catch at deep cover and the ball bounces just in front of him to go away to the fence. That was sliced away powerfully and Chahar came charging in only to find the ball dropping right in front of him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slightly full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets down on one knee and slogsweeps it over mid-wicket. Easy!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now {{BATSMAN}} joins in the fun. Not great from {{BOWLER}} actually. Can't feed him on the pads with a length ball, gets flicked away in a flash to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 15 off the over! {{BATSMAN}} is motoring towards yet another IPL century! Too short from {{BOWLER}} and the Aussie sits back to pull this away through backward square leg. Short fine leg is the only man there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking stroke! The previous one was a bad ball but this is just a stunning shot. There was width but on a length, {{BATSMAN}} just went through on the front foot and thumped the drive on the up. Bisected mid-off and extra cover easily\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how did he manage to hit that so well. Good slower ball bouncer, {{BATSMAN}} got into an awkward position to scoop that, went through with that shot and it bounced inside the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} shows poor technique and shot selection, trying to drag it towards the on-side with a pull, gets a thick under-edge away to fine leg where Bumrah puts in the dive but in vain as it goes through for four. Good effort, but not good enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, if you are bowling full and outsi{{BATSMAN}} off stump it's got to be really wi{{BATSMAN}}. This is right in the slot as {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker, {{BATSMAN}} gets into a great position to loft over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time he clears the off-side field. Slower delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, delays his punch and hits it along the ground through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, right into the gap there! Shortish delivery on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} goes back and pulls it with authority beating the man at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 17 off the first over from {{BOWLER}}. I think Maxwell will have to turn to spin. His pacers are disappearing. Slower ball outside off, it's full and in the slot, and {{BATSMAN}} nails him through extra-cover again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full marks for effort from Iyer, but he could not stop the boundary. Length delivery on off, {{BATSMAN}} heaved and the inside edge squirted towards fine leg. Iyer ran across from deep square and dived, but the ball won the race\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh that is quite a flick shot off the back foot. Wasn't all that short to be honest, he flicked that off the kneeroll! My word! Somehow generated enough power to beat the deep mid-wicket fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} carves it away to deep backward point for four. A hit-me delivery and gets the treatment.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is poor from {{BOWLER}}. Sprays it down the leg side, all {{BATSMAN}} had to do was to get some wood. He gets plenty of it and the ball races down to the fine leg fence in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, has to wait a bit as the length is a touch shorter. Cuts and finds the gap past a diving extra cover, another four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's been dragged all the way to the wide long-on fence. Pure despair for {{BOWLER}}. He's bowled this so wide of off and to see the ball being swatted into the on-side is downright demoralizing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wants to drag the sweep shot from well wide of off, but only manages an under-edge. Cruelly for {{BOWLER}} though, it's gone between the keeper's legs for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pacy bouncer and {{BATSMAN}} isn't holding back this time. Wields his willow through a fiery pull and top-edges it over the keeper's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fastest fifty partnership in IPL 2019! {{TEAM}} are on rampage here! {{BATSMAN}} joins in the fun with a lovely paddle sweep, the line was too straight from {{BOWLER}} and it was helped away quite fine. Well wide of short fine leg who could do nothing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow. Incredible hands by {{BATSMAN}}. And almost six. One bounce over the ropes. Full and with mid-off up was asking for trouble. {{BATSMAN}} whiplashed it over the fielder. Raw power\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a crispy drive by {{BATSMAN}}! An overpitched delivery outside off and the southpaw creams it through extra cover. Miller in the deep sprinted across and although he put in a dive, he couldn't quite stop the ball, four runs for the young batsman\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, educated edge and {{BATSMAN}} collects a boundary. Shortish just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} intentionally opens the bat face at the last minute and guides it through the vacant slip cordon. Cheekily done!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot, friendly full-toss from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it, shuffles across and shovels it in front of square on the on-si{{BOWLER}}, beats the man getting across from the {{BOWLER}}ep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gee! That has been smashed. {{BATSMAN}} looks in his elements today, ominous signs for Kings. It was on a fuller length, was in the slot for {{BATSMAN}}. He gets under it and pumps it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hammers this! Very full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} holds his shape and lifts it straight over the bowler's head. Dead straight and it rockets to the fence. 11 off the over, a good one but those three dot balls, will they hurt on this seemingly belter of a pitch? Another over left though to make up for it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball on leg, {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knee and hacks it over square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a boundary to cap off the over. A short of length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and places it behind point. No chance for the third man fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, second boundary for {{BATSMAN}}. didn't try to over-hit, timed it well and the placement was good. The line is too straight from {{BOWLER}} - strayed on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} used his wrists to glance it away in front of square on the leg-side. The man inside the 30-yard circle gives a chase, but can only escort the ball to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not the best of starts for {{BOWLER}}, nothing wrong with that back of a length delivery in the zone, and that's just a lazy late-cut to the vacant fine third man boundary for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, waits on it and pulls it down past short fine leg for a four. Drops it short and slow, {{BATSMAN}} stayed still and waited on it before pulling it past the fielder. Only 6 runs needed now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he has had luck and this proves that today is his day. Good length ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg to have a heave to the on-side, the thick inside edge races past the the stumps\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} getting innovative. {{BOWLER}} is taken by surprise. The fast wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} decides to play the reverse sweep, more of a top-edge and the ball clears backward point before running away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, this is a poor over from {{BOWLER}}, banged in short and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across and helps it over short fine, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's an incredible shot. Was a full ball and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get down to sweep. Can't call it as sweep. A half-sweep, half-whip. Powerfully hit through square leg. Raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh spanked! Pressure on the debutant straightaway. Two fours out of two. He goes short this time and {{BATSMAN}} absolutely slaughters him on the front foot. Rockets away through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets another drag down. And the off-cutter. Opens up his front leg, lines up and has all the time to unleash a power through mid-wicket. A much needed fence hit for Mumbai - and {{BATSMAN}}. Only his second\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no {{BATSMAN}} ain't cheeky enough for these late cuts. Just can't line himself up right, just about fetches it out of DK's gloves as he outside-edges it past the cordon. Ah, never mind\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 124kph, short of length delivery just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} cheekily dabs it fine of short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rank long hop and {{BATSMAN}} won't spare those. Well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back, picks his spot and hammers it to the cow corner fence. Threaded the gap beautifully\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's no stopping him tonight. This is short again outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes back in his crease and slams it through the gap at covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he almost did! Ends unbeaten on 99! {{BATSMAN}} would have wanted that one run but then, don't think he will be too worried about not getting to the milestone. {{BOWLER}} missed the wide yorker marginally this time and it was sliced away, well wide of short third man and to the fence for a boundary. {{BATSMAN}} is only the second batsman to end on 99 not out in the IPL after Raina\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slightly slower in the early 130s and {{BATSMAN}} has picked him. Slices it square on the off-si{{BATSMAN}} and manages to place it wi{{BATSMAN}} of the {{BATSMAN}}ep point fiel{{BATSMAN}}r. 29 off the last two\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this one was much slower from {{BOWLER}}, he was guilty of providing width again. {{BATSMAN}} delays his bat swing and powers it wide of backward point for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Harshal at square third man can't get to it. Played much finer by {{BATSMAN}} this time, opening the bat face and slicing it just wide of the keeper. No pace lost here. {{BOWLER}} bowling them at over 140 clicks and {{BATSMAN}} ensuring that they run to the fence as quick. Conservation of pace\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, AB is away. They need a move on and who better than {{BATSMAN}} to rely on. Not a bad {{BATSMAN}}livery by any means. Back of a length {{BATSMAN}}livery and {{BATSMAN}} thumps it over mid-on, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} finds the gap this time. Off the mark with a boundary. {{BOWLER}} keeps it short, just a hint of width and {{BATSMAN}} takes toll. Waits back and punches it through cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, excellent execution of the sweep. Preempted, went down and predicted the bowler to pitch it on leg-stump. Swept it wide of short fine leg and {{BATSMAN}} earns a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 16 off the fourth over. Superb adjustment. Seeing {{BATSMAN}} jogging down, {{BOWLER}} darts it outside off, {{BATSMAN}} spots it slices it backward of point. One bounce into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slapped down the ground! That is a four..waited on it and slammed it over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's overpitched and it's gone to the fence in a flash. Du {{BATSMAN}} leans across, right on top of it, before drilling it through the covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played, the loopy slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, kept dipping onto the left-hander - {{BATSMAN}} was setting himself up for the pull, bends down low with the ball and then sweeps it behind square on the on-side - beat the man in the ring and raced away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done. He's not giving up. Pitched it right up there again, desperately hoping for some swing, but is driven handsomely down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's down the leg side and {{BATSMAN}} tickles it away for four! The man at fine leg had no chance. A fine fifty from the South African. This knock has ensured that {{TEAM}} are chasing this down without much of a problem\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} picking up the run rate. Six followed by a four. Rubbish from {{BOWLER}}, sprays it down leg, {{BATSMAN}} helps it along the way and beats a squarish fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has found the gap to perfection. There was a man at fine leg and at deep mid-wicket but {{BATSMAN}} pulls it right between the two fielders. The timing was also good enough and it races to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has had the wood over {{BOWLER}} in this innings. Continues to collect runs off the Sri Lankan. Full and down leg, {{BATSMAN}} tickles it very fine. No chance for Bumrah in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, KKR have bowled a lot of short balls to {{BATSMAN}} today and most of them have disappeared. This was outside off and {{BATSMAN}} had the room to free his arms, slaps it over extra cover and the ball bounces just inside the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50-run stand up for the fifth wicket! {{BOWLER}} immediately has a change in the field. Goes short and {{BATSMAN}} makes sure to send it away to the fence. Hooks it over the fielder at short fine leg for four more..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that will run away. {{BOWLER}} strays in line and bowls it on leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} simply had to glance it away past the fielder at short fine leg. Neat wrists\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged, but safe! Short of a length on leg, {{BATSMAN}} swings across the line and gets a under-edge that dips in front of Bairstow, beats his dive and finds the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 147kph on that length ball and {{BATSMAN}} uses all of it to slice the ball over backward point. Or maybe I'm giving him too much credit and it's just a thick outside edge. In either case, he went hard and the ball flew\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, consecutive fours for {{BATSMAN}}. He's started to up the ante. Gets low, takes it in front of the stumps and slog-sweeps it powerfully in front of square. Threads the gap at deep mid-wicket and collects a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smokes this half-volley through extra cover to get the chase up and running. No great footwork, there didn't need to be as the hands are good enough for a delivery right in the slot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slams over extra cover. Shuffles across early, which {{BOWLER}} sees and goes wider .. and gets carved over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, second boundary of the over for {{BATSMAN}}. He holds the key for {{TEAM}}. {{BOWLER}} goes full and {{BATSMAN}} says thank you very much, drilled down the ground past mid-off. That ends {{BOWLER}}'s spell, 4-0-36-0. He's still searching for his 100th IPL wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has come out aggressively. Someone might have told him that the Indian team for Champions Trophy might be selected tomorrow. {{BOWLER}} shortened the length as he spotted {{BATSMAN}} running down the track, makes room and slaps it over cover. Rahane has no chance in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swing for {{BOWLER}}, but it's full and way outside off. {{BATSMAN}} leans into the drive and hits it over the man at cover-point, a few bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky! This guy is not all about power! Full ball and he's smartly moved across to scoop this over the infield with fine leg insi{{BATSMAN}} the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, missed out on his century by 4 runs in the previous game and here's a boundary two nights later. Short of a length outside off and Watto punches it firmly through the gap at covers. Lewis goes for the chase, puts in a dive near the fence as well but the momentum takes it away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no stoppin him now! {{BOWLER}} presents a juicy freebie on the pads, a full toss and it's been helped past the man at short fine leg by the pocket sized dynamite. Has been a day of left han{{BATSMAN}}rs. Warner earlier in the day, Pant in the previous innings and {{BATSMAN}} now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ah, stunning. {{BOWLER}} looks to bang it in short, but {{BATSMAN}}'s standing taller, with a lofted pull, over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it doesn't matter for {{BATSMAN}}. He joins the party as well. Walks across his stumps, waits deep and absolutely spanks it wide of long-off, who gives up the chase. Another massive over, 19 off it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picks the gap does Quinton {{BATSMAN}}, it was full and in his zone - he goes down on one knee and hammers it over mid-wicket to ping it in the gap between long-on and {{BATSMAN}}ep square. Smart batting!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, you don't bowl full tosses to DK. Not when he's in such form. DK leans forward a touch and belts the leather through covers, blazed away...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act. Backs away, makes room and {{BOWLER}} helped him by slanting it on the stumps. Golf-swung over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, normal pace from {{BOWLER}} this time, {{BATSMAN}} uses those extra 10kph and slices it away through backward point. Nicely done\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fires it too wide of off, Jaddu makes full use of it. Just angles his bat down which takes some wood and races down to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this was probably the first quicker one from {{BOWLER}}, it was on a fuller length. And {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knees and slog-sweeps it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, these are weird tactics. Both fine leg and third man are up, so you'd expect the length to be full. But {{BOWLER}}'s gone short more often than not. Now agreed, this one rushes {{BATSMAN}} on the pull as he's taken by surprise. But he swings into it and the top-edge balloons past the keeper. Always a risk with this field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is poor from {{BOWLER}}. He's getting the slow nature of the deck to assist him but instead of bowling tigher, feeds a boundary ball. Fed on the pads with fine leg up, {{BATSMAN}} isn't missing out. Shuffles across and glances it wide of that fielder in the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another miscue but it won't matter. {{BATSMAN}} brings up his 9th fifty in IPL. Another slower cutter slanting away from the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink and gets a thick outside edge which flies over backward point and into the square third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is a dream start for DC. Four boundaries in four balls now. You can't complain about this ball though. Nice good length delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} punches off the front foot and gets a thick edge that rolls fine and beats third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bisects the gap on this occasion. {{BATSMAN}} reaches his fifty, up goes the bat as well. Similar delivery from {{BOWLER}}, getting too predictable as {{BATSMAN}} lines up and smashes it in the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}}'s over is ruined once again off the last ball, this was tossed up nicely outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bent half-forward, reverses his stance and helps it on its way to the long leg fence, make it off the fifth ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a freebie from {{BOWLER}} to welcome {{BATSMAN}}. Googly which is short and down leg, {{BATSMAN}} went for the big pull and under edge it fine. The man in the deep was square and had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's no stopping him. Walks down the wicket and chips the widish delivery over cover. Long-off sprints across to stop it but the ball wins the race\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is power and placement combined! Packs a punch with a shot on the up and the ball speeds away through the off-side for a four into the covers. {{TEAM}} end the powerplay period on a high\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant improvisation. Takes it from middle and scoops wide of short fine. Nothing wrong from {{BOWLER}} who attempted the yorker, didn't nail it and it was the cleverness of {{BATSMAN}} that outwitted him there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that will run away. Slightly straight from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} has picked him away so easily. The faintest of tickles to get it past the wicketkeeper. He's looking good again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is poor bowling from {{BOWLER}} after a good start. Once again errs in line, feeds it down leg and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of this inswinger. Fine is up in the ring and this is clipped fine enough. All too easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tossed up but drifting into the dangerous pad-line, and he's thrashed the sweep away to the backward square leg boundary for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed, {{TEAM}} need to get going and {{BATSMAN}} will start playing his shots - came down the track and drilled this short ball wide of cover - Warner gives chase, but he was always coming second best\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that ruins the over for {{BOWLER}}, another full-toss, but this time on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he gets inside the line and helps it on its way. Nice way to get going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, leaning drive! Classical touch play with a big stride forward and the ball screams past cover for a four. Slightly flatter it might have been and the batsman got it away. That would help\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slapped over mid-wicket! Fractionally short and {{BATSMAN}} picked the length early, didn't bother going back as he pulled this comfortably over mid-wicket. Clean strike\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a real drag down. The {{BOWLER}} slower back hander but half way down the ground. All the time for the adjustment and {{BATSMAN}} does it in executing his crouched pull. Axar did get a hand in his stretch at the fence, the power imparted was enough to burst through a wall though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's his turn to inside-out. Steps away, makes room and lofts one-bounced into extra cover's ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, silky stroke from Jinks. Was a bad ball though, full and down leg, he just got across to glance it wide of short fine leg. The outfield here is the batsman's ally once he gets past the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, keeping things simple and straight is {{BATSMAN}} there. There was a hint of movement on this full ball. {{BATSMAN}} did well to not try something fancy, presented the full blade and bisected the gap between the bowler and mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! He picked the wrong 'un and though he was hitting against the spin, he was in complete control. Went down on his knee, rolled his wrists and broomed it to deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now goes over mid-wicket. Predictably {{BOWLER}} pings it short, {{BATSMAN}} is waiting on the back foot. Hammered the pull and there's no-one at deep mid. Takes another boundary. Intelligence and cricket awareness on display\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the timing off the very first ball, it's like he's turned up after an hour's batting in the nets. Fuller than a length on middle and leg, some shape for {{BOWLER}} but {{BATSMAN}} whips it with such class through square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, poor line and length from {{BOWLER}}, can't offer width with third man inside the ring - {{BATSMAN}} waits on the ball, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and guides it behind square on the off-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, appaling from {{BOWLER}}. Splays it on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} is clever as he moves inside the line and tucks it fine. Harpreet from fine leg was slightly squarer and despite his dive, the ball runs away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunched away! Fractionally short from {{BOWLER}} and it's the trademark pull from {{BATSMAN}}. Rocks back quickly and dispatches it over mid-wicket. Clean hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, welcome into the attack Mr. {{BOWLER}}! Back of a length delivery at 150kph, {{BATSMAN}} swings hard and gets it off the inside edge through square leg. No fielders stationed in that region and that shall be the first boundary of the innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gentle from the giant! That was short from round the wicket and the little bit of room was used well by {{BATSMAN}}. Just guided the ball between point and short third man for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has stepped on the gas now. The slower short of length delivery and he's into position quickly, swivels and places the pull with a nice wrist roll backward of square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wide yorker outside off, runs away for four off the outside edge. One of the pitfalls with {{BOWLER}} firing them in. No chance for short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, perfect length for {{BATSMAN}}. Not too full, not too short, so he could kneel and half-pull half-sweep that through fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 138ks just full enough for {{BATSMAN}} to lay into a gorgeous check-drive, plays it on the rise and pierces the gap between cover and extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the slower version of Sran's slower ball, {{BATSMAN}} didn't read it as he was early into the shot. But got it off the meat as he went for the pull and sent it behind square on the leg-side. No-one there and he'll collect a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full and sliding down leg, {{BATSMAN}} bends half-way down and sweeps it fine - Ishant, at short fine dived over the ball and lets another boundary through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 142.6kph, short ball from {{BOWLER}}, it was on the stumps. But, {{BATSMAN}} walks away towards the leg-side which allows his free arms and plays an aerial cut shot over backward point. A one-bounce four and {{BATSMAN}} made it look so easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pick. Heave. Dispatch. Very agricultural without a lot of feet, using the slow sitter to just swing across the line and smoke it into long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's nicely played! Was on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} clips it past the fielder at backward square leg. With the dew setting in, the lightning quick outfield beats the fielder's chase and takes it away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball wide outside off, a horizontal-batted crash to deep point for four. They're away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fine leg's inside, and if that's not a legality to go extravagant, nothing is! {{BATSMAN}} reads the slower one, shuffles, sits on a knee and sweeps, well past 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another iffy slog which results in a miscue, but {{BATSMAN}} gets enough on it this time to drag the ball over wide mid-on and into the boundary. That's precisely why he was targeting this shot. Mid-on is inside the ring, and with a little bit of fortune, he's able to muscle it over him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and again. As soon as {{BATSMAN}} comes on strike, {{BOWLER}} forgets words like \"flight, air-time, tossing.\" MS Dhoni has to be behind the stumps to give him advice when he is under pressure. This is a big outfield and maybe he need not be afraid to toss a ball up. It's flat, quick, short, {{BATSMAN}} pulls it nicely past the deep mid-wicket fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice touch from {{BATSMAN}}, back of a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and runs it fine, good enough to beat third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now that's been struck extremely sweetly. Full ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} gets the front leg out of the way and nails the drive straight of mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, why bowl a short quick ball when the flighted deliveries are doing the job for you. Surya stays back, lets the ball come and cuts to the right of short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that shall give him some confidence! Tad full in length around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knee and sweeps it uppishly over square leg. Almost went the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what a start from AB! He smokes this off the back foot past backward point. Short and wi{{BATSMAN}} from {{BOWLER}}, and a player of AB's class won't miss out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cute little paddle now. The line is down leg and with short fine inside that's not the way to go, {{BATSMAN}} gets sufficient bat on that and beats the man inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top-edged over short fine leg. Unlucky {{BOWLER}}. He's rushed {{BATSMAN}} on the pull again and he's not in any control whatsoever\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's the healthiest of edges you can get. Lucky runs. Precious runs for {{TEAM}}. The yellow contingent believes. Ceee Esss Kayyy chants ringing in the ground. Shortish delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} slogs and gets a thick edge that flies over the leaping QdK\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lashed over backward point, width on offer from Krishna and {{BATSMAN}} cashed in big time. Reaches out and slaps it over point, a few bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ooh, he didn't time it as he would've liked but still earns himself a boundary. A dipping low full toss from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} miscued it as he dragged it off the cue-end. Squirts it over mid-off and off it goes away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, welcome to Delhi says Rishabh {{BATSMAN}}. A loosener from {{BOWLER}}. Quick delivery well down leg, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to get low and smack the sweep well wide of short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, up and over! Overcooked from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} goes aerial. Front foot loft, comfortably over extra cover and it races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, dropped it short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it and cuts it hard, beats backward point to his left and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, two fours in a row for {{BATSMAN}}. This was a poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, drifts one on the pads, all {{BATSMAN}} had to do was to get some wood on it, which he did and it races away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another boundary from {{BATSMAN}}. He is putting up a show here. It was a flighted delivery and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} lofts it wide of long-off for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 13 off the over after bowling a brilliant first ball. Length ball down leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and flicks it well past the short fine leg fielder. Easy runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is classy. Effortless batting by DK. Length delivery angling in to middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} flicks over mid-wicket and leaves deep mid a spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he won't miss out on that, will {{BATSMAN}}! Waits for the slower delivery, rocks back and pumps it right over the bowler's head to get off the mark in style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged, missed the stumps and races away to the fence. 14 runs off the over. It was a skiddy length ball from round the wicket and {{BATSMAN}} checked his cross-batted stroke. The ball trimmed the inside edge, missed the sticks and evaded the keeper to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, from bad to worse. 20 runs of the over already. Short ball around leg, {{BATSMAN}} tries to flick it away but the ball clips his pads instead and races away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, chipped over extra cover! Fuller and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} with his long levers spanks it over the in-field. It came off the cue-end but comfortably cleared the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 14 off first three balls. {{BOWLER}} overcompensates and hurls it well outside off. {{BATSMAN}} leant across and spanked it with ferocity over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, huge appeal for lbw, but no signs of review and rightly so. Off the willow. A loopy full toss from {{BOWLER}}, AB had walked a long way and had to adjust to the line at the last moment, plants his front knee onto the ground and manages to find a flicker of an insi{{BATSMAN}} edge on the slog to send it fine past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edge. And the Royals have a massive edge of life. 15 off this one and all of a sudden there's oxygen still there in this one. A low full toss, across {{BATSMAN}}, who throws his bat out in an attempt to slice. He'll make his peace with the edge, running past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} can't afford to drop short on this pitch. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and pulls it through mid-wicket, bisects the two men in the deep to a nicety\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, hint of width and those fast hands of {{BATSMAN}} does the rest - stands tall and punches it in front of square on the off-side, past the dive at backward point and runs away to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, can't bowl short to {{BATSMAN}} at this pace, {{BOWLER}}! Gonna get punished for sure. This is a harmless half-tracker on leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} sits back and pulls this away through mid-wicket. Didn't middle it all that well, still got it to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a junk from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} says thanks. Strays on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and tucks it very fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nails his sweep now .. yea, there's a thin line between confidence and desperation, and {{BATSMAN}}'s still unsure where he stands, but he's taken this on full-blooded, going one-kneed and bisecting deep mid-wicket and deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, awful from {{BOWLER}}. Just bonus runs. Full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} simply lays his bat on it and finds the gap through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a quicker one from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} makes use of the pace to reverse slap it past the diving left hand of Watson at backward point. Got great power behind the shot did the {{TEAM}} skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, powers the ball away! That is a four. Little backing away movement and the batsman gatecrashes that one past cover for a four. The lack of pace did not help\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, this was slower bouncer from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} waits on it and ramps it over Dhoni's head, third man was inside the ring and the ball rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, consecutive boundaries to finish an eventful first over. Too straight, on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it off his pads past the square leg umpire, the quick outfield does the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice late guide to this short ball, third man dives to his right and palms it on the bounce as he can't get there. Oh is the right foot touching the rope as he recovered and try to flick it back? Yep, four!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball, full on leg and middle, {{BATSMAN}} picks it and brings his wrists into play. Flicked away through the gap between mid-wicket and mid-on. Second boundary of the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is only going to bowl googlies, so {{BATSMAN}} moves across and scoops the ball over Lynn at short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor start from {{BOWLER}}. He needs to be better than that. Back of a length and on the hips, {{BATSMAN}} does nothing fancy, whips it with a strong bottom hand backward of square, no chance for the fielder in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swivel-pulled past short fine leg. Off-pace delivery from {{BOWLER}}, too short and down leg. {{BATSMAN}} pulls it hard and places it in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is typical {{BATSMAN}}! Clears his front leg, moves to the leg-side and then the long tentacles get into the act. Fetches the short of length delivery and clubs the pull away towards the deep mid area for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, finishing touches. Make it 21 off the over -- and {{BATSMAN}}'s done it with a flash straight down. 213 it will be ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wrong lines from {{BOWLER}}, and {{BATSMAN}} will pick him away from there all day everday. Fullish on the pads, he's been flicked away behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a freebie and {{BATSMAN}} puts it away. Shortish and sliding down leg, he just walks across a bit and deflects it well wide of Dhoni with a neat glance. Races away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overpitched and {{BATSMAN}} goes aerial. Just cleared his front leg a bit and lofted through the line, well wide of mid-off and on the bounce for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is tripe. Gift packed and delivered to {{BATSMAN}}. Flat and short outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes back and thrashes it through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top-edge but goes to the fence! Another attempted swipe across the line, this is short and pacy, and it's no surprise that young {{BATSMAN}} is very late. Slices this way over the keeper and very fine down to third man fence. They all count\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's brutalized behind square on the off-side. That bouncer might have just woken him up. Clears his front leg, waits for the length ball to arrive and smashes it with the amount of power only MAXI can generate. Those Popeye arms..woof!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has certainly enjoyed batting against {{BOWLER}}. Slower short ball, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and slaps the pull in front of square, bisecting deep mid-wicket and long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's a backward point close in and then a short third man behind him, with no third man in place. Full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lashes a square drive in the air and manages to elude the leaping backward point fielder to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smacked straight back past the bowler! Those famous wrists of {{BATSMAN}} and although it was aerial, {{BOWLER}} had no chance. Was a float up that got drilled mercilessly down the ground. Rocketed to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is pick your spot bowling from {{BOWLER}}. Short delivery outside off, pleading to be hit and {{BATSMAN}} slaps it over cover. {{TEAM}} are off to a flier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done by {{BATSMAN}}, he pre-empted that {{BOWLER}} was going to bowl full, bent down low, uses the pace on the ball and flicks it fine, no chance for the fielder at long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow. That sped off the bat. {{BATSMAN}} breaks the shackles, stands tall and extends his hands into fierce punch, right off the middle and pistols away to the fence beating the sweeper cover fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deftly played. Googly but it's wide, and {{BATSMAN}} waits and glides it just wide of the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, almost an action replay of the previous shot. An ordinary over from {{BOWLER}} to complete what has been a fine spell. Short again, {{BATSMAN}} belts it in the same place on the field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets the room to free his arms and creams the ball away into the covers. No one moved as the ball sped away into the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full toss outside off, Faf flays it over point. Now the highest partnership for {{TEAM}} in IPL\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clears his front leg and thrashes the pitched up delivery past the non-striker. Brute power from {{BATSMAN}}!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half-volley on off-stump and {{BATSMAN}} will not miss out. Unleashes those powerful bottom hand as he chips the loifted drive straight down the ground, straight as an arrow!!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how are the nerves now SRH? How are the nerves now Carlos? Full ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slices it away over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, typical Steven {{BATSMAN}}! All wristy. Ambles down the pitch and uses those whippy wrists to time and place the flick in the gap wide of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Hardik puts down a dolly! The catching in this IPL hasn't been good at all. This is another instance of a superb fielder spilling an easy chance. Was short and wide, bowled cleverly by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} tried to upper-cut it. Doesn't get the distance and Hardik at sweeper overruns the ball. What's worse, it's gone to the fence. He has his sunglasses on so no excuse of the sun in the eyes either\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's so effortlessly done! So, its a short ball on middle, {{BATSMAN}} jumps back to create that extra leeway on the leg-side, spots the ball and punches it crisply through mid-wicket. Easy peasy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's his area - behind square on the on-side and {{BOWLER}} is playing into his court by bowling it short. Now that {{BATSMAN}} has got the idea of the pace off the pitch, he is picking them well. Pulled this one over the man at fine leg, who is inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another flighted delivery, not much of turn and {{BATSMAN}} brooms it away through mid-wicket. The man in the deep couldn't get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just doesn't give out any pace to work around with, but {{BATSMAN}} has enough of his own. Making some room, and going back in the crease to pile on the drag down as he slaps it damn violently through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, glorious from {{BATSMAN}}. Indipper on a fuller length at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't try to hit it too hard. Just presents a straight bat face and drives it elegantly past mid-on. His drives are a thing of beauty..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, awful start this has been for {{BOWLER}}. Overbakes and bangs it short, sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}}, who skips back and muscles the pull in front of square on the on-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball banged in short, {{BATSMAN}} gets it off the outside half, slicing the ball fine of the short third man fielder for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, can't bowl short to {{BATSMAN}} when it's not that high. He'll pick on you every single time. Swivels this time and helps it along, clearing short fine leg quite easily\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, room on offer and {{BATSMAN}} uses it to great effect. Carves the short ball over point giving no chance for sweeper cover to cut it off. {{BATSMAN}} on fire, just 17 away from the triple treat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Rajasthan Royals finish with a mammoth 198. Bhuvi concedes 45 runs from his last 2 overs. Full and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink and the outside edge flies over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's an edge, but it won't matter. Was a really full ball around off, seaming away from {{BATSMAN}} who goes at it with hard hands. As the ball shapes away from him, it takes an outside edge and runs past the man at short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, races off the bat of {{BATSMAN}}. Did not try to hit that hard. Just timing and made sure that he placed it well. Driven on the up past cover, what a way to get off the mark\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good placement and timing to get {{BATSMAN}} off the mark. Finds the fence. Fuller ball on the pads, he shuffled across and flicked this well wide of the deep mid-wicket fielder who had lot of ground to cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is the man in form. Poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, slides one down leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets across and whips it crisply behind square. No chance for the fine leg fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, width served and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out. Was on the shorter side as well and {{BATSMAN}} used the bowler's pace to good effect. Opened the bat-face to punch it through covers. Excellent placement\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, driven past the diving mid-off this time. The key is he didn't force the shot, just allowed his instincts to take over, full and wide, all he needed was to locate the middle of the willow. Tiiiiimed!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} barely has a followthrough on this cover-drive, but the timing is sublime. Smears it over cover. {{BOWLER}} went too full there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, straight as an arrow! Now this shot should boost {{BATSMAN}}'s morale. Low full toss alright but the execution was admirable. Punchy drive that was straight back past the bowler and it rocketed to the fence. Didn't overhit it and that was the key\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, offers bit of width outside off and {{BATSMAN}} latches onto it. Treks back in his crease and fiercely cuts through covers. Good start for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now he waits on the inevitable short ball and latches onto it. Cut away through the gap at point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely shot! The off-pace delivery and {{BATSMAN}} is playing with {{BOWLER}}, makes room and lofts it inside out over extra cover, no chance for the long-off fielder to cut that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beats the chasing RCB skipper this time around. It's a lightning quick outfield, just look at it. Even the fast moving feet of Kohli can't stop this. Fullish in length around off and {{BATSMAN}} creams it through covers. The ball's lost, somewhere under the covers.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hat-trick of fours. {{BATSMAN}}'s doing it for Mumbai. Short of length ball outside off, slower one, and the {{TEAM}} skipper is able to thread it through backward point and third man. Brilliantly glided\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is a dream start for {{TEAM}}. Four boundaries in four balls now. You can't complain about this ball though. Nice good length delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} punches off the front foot and gets a thick edge that rolls fine and beats third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done as he wristily whips the ball in the air over the man at mid-on. A few bounces and into the fence. A length ball it was and the batsman did it with nonchalance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, all timing. And glory. Nicely pitched up, very friendly. The reply isn't am afraid. A perfect approach to the pitch of the delivery and a smear to time the pants off it. Through the covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, welcome into the attack Mr. {{BOWLER}}! {{BATSMAN}} will love this - left-armer turning it back into him. Leg-side is going to be busy. This was actually bowled pretty well, very slow although full, {{BATSMAN}} delays the lofted drive and manages to hit it straight over the bowler to split long-off and long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and four, slower and wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and runs it past short third man, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 150.3kph in a low full toss. {{BATSMAN}}' measured this field, he knows Krishna can't bowl short with the first ball wide and then sits way, way inside his crease to slash it away through an empty point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is excellent improvisation from {{BATSMAN}}. Gets well outside the line and sweeps it over short fine leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pace can be your enemy sometimes, like on this occasion when you lose your radar. Short and slipping down leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and tickles it away past a diving short fine to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nothing two-paced when you grant out a friendly overpitch. Lovely bat swing, opening up the gap over mid-off and timing the pants off it .. inside-out slap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the leakage goes up to 17. {{BOWLER}} keeps digging it short, the pitch doesn't get it up and {{BATSMAN}} keeps raking in the boundaries. Is as usual away on the charge, and the bat transforms into a sword as he stabs it in the air. Over point and guess where it goes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, that's beaten everyone! Lots of turn on this off break and {{BATSMAN}} brings out the reverse sweep to combat it. Cannot connect and Klaasen didn't anticipate the spin either. Races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, larruped over mid-on. Easy-peasy for {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} missed the yorker, {{BATSMAN}} gets deep and clears his front leg to whip it firmly over the in-field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 'please hit-me,' will you? Short and wide delivery, DK rocks back and murders the cut in the gap between backward point and cover-point. See ya later...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, raining boundaries now! This is the over {{TEAM}} needed to turn this game around and {{BOWLER}} is bearing the brunt of it. Misses the yorker for the second time in as many deliveries and it's a full toss on the pads, easily chipped away aerially but well wide of short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drops it short does {{BOWLER}} and the batsman scooters back to pounce on it. Munches the cut past the man at backward point to send the ball racing into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superb shot! Full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} stays in his crease and drives this on the up square through the off-side. Timing was the standout factor as he threaded the stacked field set, through backward point and races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, overpitched and on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he leans forward, gets close to the ball and then plays the on-drive, beat the two fielders in the deep to a nicety\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, taking pace off is fine, but you can't bowl down leg with no fine leg. Easily helped away behind square for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the power of {{BATSMAN}} on that shot will take that away to the fence. Slower delivery, the knuckle ball by Bhuvi, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and goes through with his horizontal slap, beats the man at mid-on and finds the fence. Wasn't middled properly but those muscles help him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now the homeboy roar. On the dance, in the slot and tonking it straight down. Oh the bat flow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this was quite intentional from Robbie. Plants his front foot forward, looking to defend. The ball came in with the angle, takes the outer half of his willow and runs away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, that might help {{BATSMAN}} break the shackles, on a good length and just outside off, he plonked his front-foot forward and lifted it through the line, over mid-wicket and almost all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one bounce over the ropes at wide long-on. {{BATSMAN}} against the left-arm spinner is always advantage to the batsman. He kneels down and slogs it into the gap. Did well to hit it wide of Pollard\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a big effort from Rajpoot at fine leg, but that would have been the catch of the season had he held it - length ball down leg and {{BATSMAN}} whipped it violently towards fine leg - The ball was travelling and Ankit ran across to his left - put in the dive, but the ball was always going away from him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crashed away! Short of a length angling across {{BATSMAN}}, a bit of width and he stands tall to flay the cut through point. Cracking stroke!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, up and over! Rises on his toes and lifts a wide ball with a flat bat, over cover and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's it! Chennai Super Kings are champions of IPL for the third time. What a brilliant return to the stage this is from {{TEAM}} after a two-year ban. The players rush to the middle to mob Watson. Meanwhile, captain Dhoni is gently walking around with a gentle smile of his\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misfield by Gayle and that shall be the first boundary of the innings for {{BATSMAN}}. Was a slower short ball down the leg side and {{BATSMAN}} helped it to short fine leg where Gayle got his hands to it and parried it away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half-volley, keep 'em coming screams {{BATSMAN}}'s willow. Just leans forward slightly and creams it off the middle wide of mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bad delivery and deserved the treatment. Short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} threw the whole kitchen sink at that, sliced it off the outside edge to third man, got it fine enough and beat Aravind to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} wants to show who is the boss here. He backs away, goes on the top of the bounce and punches it though cover for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, showing his range now {{BATSMAN}}. Doesn't shy away from staying good few inches outside the crease and thumps the ball over a helpless mid-off this time. Gee, this is some clean striking\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hundred for {{BATSMAN}}. Second in the IPL for him. Both have come in the last two seasons. He is making sure that Warne was right about his prediction. A innings of top quality. He raises bat and fist pumps both his hands. The Royals family love it and all are on their feet to applaud the innings. Short of length and {{BATSMAN}} slaps the pull to long-on, the fielder gets across and dives but does not get enough to stop the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Stoinis lets it through! Poor fielding and his Aussie teammate who is bowling won't be amused at all. Slower and fuller outside off, {{BATSMAN}} absolutely belted the drive but it shopuld have been cut off at sweeper cover. Instead it sneaks through Stoinis and crashes into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played! It wasn't a bad ball from {{BOWLER}}, slower and on the off-stump line, {{BATSMAN}} made room by backing away, waits on the ball and finds the gap past cover with a blazing drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor start from {{BOWLER}}. Half tracker and {{BATSMAN}} does not miss out, he plays the back foot punch past extra cover and the timing takes care of the rest. He relied on timing rather than power\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracks away a pull shot. Who said he's not good with the short balls. Rises in sync with the height on this short delivery and pumps it through square leg. Another great shot today from the master\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets a hint of width outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink and the top-edge flies to the third man fence in a giffy, no chance for the fielder in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too straight from {{BOWLER}}, ends up drifting onto Karun's pads, he uses the pace on the ball and flicks it behind square on the on-side. The man in the deep was very square and has no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} dared to put his hands up, but he wasn't stopping this. A bit short of the blockhole this time, {{BATSMAN}} accentuates the error by going deep in his crease and drills it hard and straight. Keeps {{TEAM}} breathing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and sliding down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} uses the line to broom it fine past the keeper for an easy boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR. Just stand and deposit. Stays firm and picks the length early to lash a one-bounce four over mid-on, just an extension of the drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, such strong bottom hand! Wow! This kid certainly packs a punch, doesn't he? Fired fuller by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} was on the charge, adjusts to drill it powerfully past the bowler. Long-on had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, when it's turning, when it's {{BATSMAN}}, this inside-out was only a matter of time. {{BOWLER}} tosses it wide for a drive, but {{BATSMAN}} goes over extra cover. Ahh, those hands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slashes and gets a thick edge that bisects Ishan Kishan and Krunal at short third. Races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss and width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} won't miss out as he blasts this through the covers. Belted it away with disdain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's more of a steer than a cut. Width on offer from {{BOWLER}} as he starts a new spell, {{BATSMAN}} times it beautifully as he guides it past backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and {{BATSMAN}} will go wide and over that man. Helped by {{BOWLER}} bowling a low full-toss, on the pads, flicked into the gap and {{BATSMAN}} gets to 50\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, neatly done! Fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. First of the season for him. He has looked good in the last few games but has been run-out in a couple of them. Today he has not thrown it away. Coming to the ball: Slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} waited for it, steered it so well that he bisected Buttler and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third man is up and {{BATSMAN}} squirts it right off the toe-edge to squeeze this through the gap. A poor delivery from {{BOWLER}}. This is way too short and wide and although {{BATSMAN}} almost failed to reach out, it deserved the punishment that it got\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, an exact replica from {{BATSMAN}} and the runs are coming now. Full and wide outside off, slower ball but the width allows the southpaw to free his arms. Crashes it through extra cover and the man at sweeper is very wide\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} continues to ooze class - knew that {{BOWLER}} would be bowling a slower ball, went right across on the paddle sweep and clears backward square leg. MS isn't looking all that impressed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no he doesn't. Was a good delivery fired into the blockhole, {{BATSMAN}} went after it with a huge swing, got an inside edge, past the stumps and past short fine leg to meet the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful shot! Goes inside-out and times this fullish delivery over extra cover. Was timed so neatly that it almost went the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short. Too wide. Further amplified by {{BATSMAN}} backing away violently. Waits on the ball to get close and slaps it through the covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} overpitches looking for swing, but it's not moving. {{BATSMAN}} lofts over the infield, the bat turned in hands, but made good enough contact to clear the man at mid-off. That gets the crowd going, first boundary of the game. 1000 runs for Davey {{BATSMAN}} at Uppal\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's successfully targetted extra cover again. Full ball outside off, pretty short of the blockhole, so Faf has enough space to get it over Williamson's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} leaves his crease too early. {{BOWLER}} sees that and throws it pretty wide but that does not help him get away. {{BATSMAN}} manages to put some bat and squeezes it to the deep backward point fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a wasted line. Ruins what was well on the course of turning out to be a top over. Down leg and helped along getting it past the man at short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more power from {{BATSMAN}}! There was a deep cover in place but he was a mere spectator as this blazed to the fence. Fuller ball outside off, juicy enough for {{BATSMAN}} to lift it over extra cover. Cracked it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, glorious! Top quality stuff from {{BATSMAN}}! Half volley from {{BOWLER}} but look at the execution. Textbook front foot cover drive on the up. Brilliantly timed and picked the gap as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pulled away! He'll continue playing the same way, doesn't matter. Short length around around off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg again and pulls it over mid-wicket, beats the man in the deep with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft touch and more runs. {{BOWLER}} fires it well down leg and {{BATSMAN}} responds with a calm paddle sweep. Gets it past the diving short fine leg fielder and this outfield shows no mercy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sliced away in front of deep point, where the fielder dashes in only to find that he's badly misjudged it. Then he doesn't put his body behind it either, allowing it to slip past the side of him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's edged and four. They are dealing in boundaries here. It was short and there was width, {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands at it. It comes off the outside half of the bat and it runs wide of third man for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, freebie down the leg-side and {{BATSMAN}} won't miss out after this kind of a start, a gentle flick shot in the gap at mid-wicket and that's all you need at the Wankhede with a fast outfield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one bounce and over the ropes. 23 have come off the opening over. Went fuller, aimed at the stumps and {{BATSMAN}} ma{{BATSMAN}} room. Cleared his front leg and blasts it over cow corner. The fiel{{BATSMAN}}r in the {{BATSMAN}}ep gave up the chase..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, remember 2015? Yea, it's that {{BATSMAN}} -- sitting down, staying under the low full-paced full toss to discoop it over the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smart batting! {{BATSMAN}} has sussed the pitch and decides to go straight with his aggressive shots. Pays off instantly. A touch fuller from {{BOWLER}} and it's been launched straight over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clubbed, nice way to start after the break, length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leant forward and lifted it high and over mid-on, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superb effort from Samson but he has dropped that and it has rolled to touch the cushions. Length ball on middle, heaved away towards deep mid, Samson was in from the boundary, backtracked and stuck his right hand up on the leap to catch, but it didn't stick. Would've been a competitor to Boult and Rashid Khan's catches had he hung on. Has a wry smile on his face\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's raced off the inside edge into the fine leg boundary. Nothing anyone could've done about it. Length ball homing in on off, {{BATSMAN}} swings off his feet and sees his luck smiling on him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Chota Gayle hits the first boundary for {{TEAM}}. Easy length ball drifting down the leg-side, just the roll of the wrists on this shot and he placed it wide of mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} plays this one with only one hand, it came off as he threw his hand at it, ends up slicing it past third man to find the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that just about spoils the over for {{BOWLER}}. Ended up giving room to {{BATSMAN}} just outside off. Enough for the latter to camp back and pierce the gap through point with a cut\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, almost a maximum. Dances down the track and elevates this shortish ball over point with a fierce cut. He played it uppishly and almost got the distance. One bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, authoritative shot! Short ball, not much venom, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and pulls it through backward square leg. The man in the deep didn't have much distance to cover, but the ball bulleted away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very sloppy from Dhawan. Attacked the ball in trying to prevent the second and gives away two more. Thrashed to him and in running to his left from sweeper, he lets it go through his hands. A slight bobble before the ball came to him, but still should've been stopped\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a freebie first up. Short and plenty of width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} tries his best to get on top of the bounce to play the cut, but flays it uppishly past the diving backward point fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short from {{BOWLER}}, can't bowl that length with his pace. {{BATSMAN}} is quick to rock back and clears mid-wicket with the pull, a few bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and effective. Short ball aimed at the body of {{BATSMAN}}. The batsman waited for it, slightly bends backward and periscopes it over the keeper's head for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is even better. {{BOWLER}} has to correct his length quickly, short of length and {{BATSMAN}} had the pace to work with, rocks back and nails the pull in front of square, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, whipped over the infield! Clever batting from {{BATSMAN}}, got one tossed up and he didn't go hard at this one. Just used his wrists and ensured that he got it over mid-wicket as there was nobody in the deep. Makes terrific contact and reaps the reward. He's looking good tonight\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too easy. Full pitch up, {{BATSMAN}}'s down quickly as well, sweeping him with utter disdain into an behind square region. Zero respect\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just over a leaping Viljoen! Nervy moment for {{BATSMAN}} who went for the slog sweep and it wasn't that far away from backward square leg where Viljoen leapt with all his might, only to clear him en route to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. One of the better T20 knocks you would see. It was a back of a length delivery on the body, {{BATSMAN}} gets behind it and half-pulls it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top-edge through fine leg. A delivery going down leg from over the wicket, the left-hander is in no shape to sweep that. Goes for it and gets lucky\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, some charity from {{BOWLER}}. A nice juicy full toss outside off for the new batsman, {{BATSMAN}} had ample time to pick his spot and he slices it behind point, away from the deep point fielder\n",
            "{{BATSMAN}} {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hacked down to fine leg by {{BATSMAN}}! On the shorter side around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and puts it away to the fine leg fence for another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's in the air but it's wide of the fielder at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} latches on to the short ball and hacks it over mid-wicket. On a bounce and over the ropes. The fielder near the boundary was sprinting across but couldn't reach there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fantastic placement. A trifle too short from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} clobbers the pull by standing up tall. Splits deep mid-wicket and long-on with precision\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full on the pads, and {{BATSMAN}} has done it! He whips it away past a diving Rajpoot at the fine leg boundary before running down and cutting a pose for the camera\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, needed, much needed. {{TEAM}} will take them any which way. Backed away and created the room to get the bat swing, carved behind point and the pace {{BOWLER}} is enough to beat the third man fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drifts on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads and gets picked away, wasn't a controlled shot that, but {{BATSMAN}} made enough contact off the bat to send it fine past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bad ball and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it. Length ball on the pads, tickled away fine to fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball. {{BATSMAN}} does not bother getting closer to the ball. All hands from him as he drives through extra cover. Zaheer has his hands on {{BOWLER}}'s shoulder. Must be some words of wisdom\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball at the body. Again skidded through and the batsman under-edges the ball away fine on the on-side for a four. That looked disconcerting for the batsman but he somehow got bat to it and sent it away. Lucky bargain for {{BATSMAN}}. 56 off the PP!!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's not the start Karthik would have wanted from a senior pro. A classic case of nerves from the opening bowler because it is not all that easy to control the new ball immediately. Bowls a freebie length ball down the leg-side and {{BATSMAN}} gleefully flicks the ball behind square past the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a fantastic shot by {{BATSMAN}}. Full length delivery on leg, {{BATSMAN}} improvises at the last moment and reverse whips it over backward point. Just eludes the man stationed in that position\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another one in anger. Oh {{BOWLER}}, typically after a catch being put down takes his frustration out by going fast, on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} cashes in with a sweep, drilling it perfectly to split the two fielders behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed, width on offer from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and thumps it over mid-off, couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, amazing shot that. Was a length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} does well to ramp this over short third man. The ball is just flying all over the place, to all the corners. Awestruck by this display of batsmanship!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time {{BATSMAN}} gets the boundary! On the pads and he swings merrily over backward square leg. Lovely bat swing and it races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good shot! Used the bowler's pace and {{BATSMAN}} collects his first boundary. A short-and-wide ball at 145.6kph, {{BATSMAN}} hops and scythes it behind backward point. No chance for the third man fielder to even get close to it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shortens the length and takes the pace off, {{BATSMAN}} had the width to free his arms and he delays the cut shot, that helped him place in the gap on the off-side ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just over a leaping Bumrah! Fortune for {{BATSMAN}} who went hard on seeing the width but was never in control. Ended up slicing it towards short third man and Bumrah despite a great leap could barely get his fingertips on it. Phew!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fuller and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} pumps it straight down the ground for a boundary. That went to the fence like a tracer bullet\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slowish leg break and that's a feeder to {{BATSMAN}}'s glory. Opens the punch and splits it between backward point and short third man. {{BOWLER}} isn't happy but pretty sure he wouldn't have been able to field it either. Pretty sure.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, should have been a single, but a bit of bad bounce adds to Vohra's woes as he ends up conceding a boundary. Yuvi lifts the drive on seeing the line wide of off and gets a lucky a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} pulls his length back and {{BATSMAN}} has taken advantage of that. Sees it, rocks back and swivels to pull it through the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark with a fine shot. {{BOWLER}} wanted to start with a yorker, misses it by a good distance, the full toss is thumped down the ground, past the diving mid-on fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, three in a row. Too short outside off, {{BATSMAN}} has played around with {{BOWLER}}'s mind. Takes full toll of this, by cutting this wide of point and cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} unleashing class! Skips out of his crease and plays a gorgeous inside out drive over extra cover with sublime timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, DD are just waiting for this to get over. The field is well up. {{BOWLER}} bowls it full just outside off and {{BATSMAN}} just has to get his placement right as he drives through extra-cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first time that {{BATSMAN}} has tried to time the ball and he gets rewarded instantly. Short and angling across him, he just uses {{BOWLER}}'s pace to steer it between short third man and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full-toss on leg-stump, easy pickings, just a deflection away towards the fine leg fence for four - {{TEAM}}'s first boundary comes after 26 balls\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's that customary dragger from the leggie. Rare loose ball, short and width for the taking, {{BATSMAN}} carves his bat staying deep and finds the gap, beats point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's beautifully done from {{BATSMAN}}. He was initially beaten by the turn on this leg-break, but he didn't commit so he was able to open the bat-face and steer it past slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 137ks, keep that coming says {{BATSMAN}}...leans onto his front foot and hammers the pitched up delivery straight back over his skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another slower delivery. Not much to guess out there for {{BATSMAN}} at the moment. Stays put and flashes the late cut in front of the backward point fielder. 79 off 51 needed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's no stopping the boundaries. {{BOWLER}} bangs it in first ball and he's been ramped over the keeper's head. What a start for Mumbai. They're absolutely flying\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first one of the innings for {{BATSMAN}}! Makes the most out of the pace on this ball. Shuffles in his crease and flicks the ball over backward square leg. No fielders in the deep and that shall be a boundary for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50-stand comes up between the duo. Overdoes the carrom ball. Short, wide and width for the taking, {{BATSMAN}} accepts it with glee and slaps it past cover-point. No sweeper cover and it'll be a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, half-tracker, the line doesn't matter, {{BATSMAN}} rolls his wrists and slambangs it with a swivel pull down to deep square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, when in doubt, sweep! Did so of late against Lanka in the T20Is and now also repeating the same. Knelt down and swept it in front of square for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 24 runs off the over. This is batting of the highest quality. No slogging or blind smashing but pure textbook cricket shots. Full delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slices it over the point region and though there was a deep point in place, Pathan could not get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} capitalizes. He drags the pull in the gap between long-on and deep midwicket to ease the pressure\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a gross delivery. Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it and lifts it over extra cover for four runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that shot was all about timing. How quickly it ran away to the fence, quite surprising. A low full toss on leg and {{BATSMAN}} times his on-drive. Mayank at long-on tried hard to cut this down but couldn't stop the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, such minimal effort from {{BATSMAN}}. Waits in his crease for this short of length delivery to arrive, uses his magical wrists and effortlessly pulls it over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Mo has just squeezed a yorker for a boundary. The only thing wrong on {{BOWLER}}'s part is - it was outside off, Mo bends down, opens the bat face and squeezes it past backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, {{BOWLER}} was trying to follow {{BATSMAN}} as he backed away, but the length is far too short, pulled away with immense power over square leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just second ball into his spell and {{BOWLER}} bowls it at 124ks whilst giving {{BATSMAN}} the width he was waiting for, open bat face and crunched off the middle through covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how well has {{BATSMAN}} played that? This was a short delivery and dipping into him. {{BATSMAN}} adjusts well and pulls it nicely, beats deep square leg by some distance and gets off the mark\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} takes a cue from his skipper and plays a fabulous shot. Gets under this full ball and almost checks his shot past mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice, confident beginning for DK. Of course, {{BOWLER}} was generous there; hurling it too full and thereby overpitching it just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} didn't do anything fancy. Just leant forward, kept his head steady and drove it beautifully through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries once again from {{BATSMAN}}, comes down the track, covered for the spin and lifts it over the head of mid-on, a couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hammered wide of mid-off! {{BATSMAN}} showing that he can fetch boundaries too. Not the right length from {{BOWLER}} who put this on a length and {{BATSMAN}} just made room to biff it through the infield. Found the gap perfectly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, educated edge if you want to call it that way but {{BATSMAN}} gets another boundary. Hung back to the shorter length with an open bat face. Got it off the outer half, just wide of slip and races away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's getting predictable. 97.8kph here, which {{BATSMAN}} first presses forward to and then piles on the line already on the pads to help - with a lot of power in his whack of course - behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, is quick to transfer his weight onto the back foot, and why? He spotted the length early, which is short, and smashed the cut behind point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's turning it on. Makes it 19 off the over courtesy a walk down and a clip off his legs. Another loss in the radar here from {{BOWLER}} darting it down leg. {{BATSMAN}}'s ain't complaining though. Just strolls and piles on the misery with a wristy airy flick in front of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has got going now, predictable delivery from {{BOWLER}}, full and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and thumps it over mid-off, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets low and across to use the inward angle from {{BOWLER}}, helps past the man at short fine leg. Welcome boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, chipped up. Was a serious miscue. But pockets a boundary for his efforts. With no one at the fence, thanks to all the wickets falling around, {{BATSMAN}} lofts it uppishly off the cue end over mid-off. That's all he had to do\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wide yorker, and really nothing wrong with this. There was a deep third man and a backward point as well. But still, {{BATSMAN}}'s found a way to angle his bat out and squeeze it extremely fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, both batsmen are dealing in boundaries now. They've got a hang of the wicket. {{BATSMAN}} backs away and slices the shortish delivery past the fielder at point, four runs for the Aussie international\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 18 runs of {{BOWLER}}'s final over! {{TEAM}} need 43 off the remaining two. Full in length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} pounces on the opportunity once again and thumps it over the infield at extra cover. That almost went the distance. Dre Russ back on strike\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and punished! I mean it wasn't all that short, but {{BATSMAN}} is quick to pick the length. Treks back in the crease does the opener and slams it through mid-wicket, that's four more! {{BOWLER}} proving to be slightly expensive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh Soni! What have you done? Slower ball, was a full toss as well. {{BATSMAN}} backs away and throws the kitchen sink. Manages an outside edge, that goes to the left of short third man. Soni, there, initially went to his right and hence couldn't stop that as it spun away from his dive. That could well be the turning point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just over mid-on. He was itching to break free. It's slightly fuller from {{BOWLER}}, but {{BATSMAN}} isn't quite to the pitch of it. But he goes through with the loft. Enough on that to clear the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no stopping him here. {{BOWLER}}'s given a full toss, he's pitched one full and wide, and now he's gone for a back of a length slower ball outside off. {{BATSMAN}} picks it up, waits on it and cuts it through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four. {{TEAM}} and {{BATSMAN}} won't mind how the runs come at this stage. Shortish outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the cut with horizontal bat and gets an outside edge which travels in a jiffy to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, streaky but {{BATSMAN}} will take those. There wasn't a first slip, Buttler dived to his left from second, but can't get to the ball. On a good length and holding its line outside off, {{BATSMAN}} just hung his bat at that, the edge bisected the keeper and second slip to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, clear intention from {{BATSMAN}}, runs down the track, was done in the by slower ball, but he had a free swing at that, gets a fat edge that flies over the lone slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh! This was fraught with danger. The quicker {{BATSMAN}}livery from {{BOWLER}}, gunning at the stumps and {{BATSMAN}} went {{BATSMAN}}ep for the cut. Manages to get his bat down in time and scythes it past backward point. That was a close call\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fine end to the over! Make that 16 runs off the opening over. {{BOWLER}} conceded 14 runs in the previous match off the first over, concedes two extra in this one. It's a back of a length delivery outside off and all {{BATSMAN}} does is simply punch it through the gap at cover-point. Into the gap and away to the fence she goes. Just the ideal start for {{TEAM}} in this mammoth run chase\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good shot! Just used the pace of {{BOWLER}} and gui{{BOWLER}}d it behind point, opened the bat face at the right moment and bisected the two fiel{{BOWLER}}rs to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and the dilscoop! Done really well as he scooped it over the keeper's head for a one bounce four. And {{BATSMAN}} has a go at someone after playing the shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time the low full toss gets the treatment. {{BATSMAN}} made a bit of room so that he could have a free swing of his arms, pumps it straight of mid-off and the ball rockets to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, offie or no offie. {{BATSMAN}} is not concerned at all. He is in brilliant form and look how easily he lofts it over cover. Mind you it is one of the most difficult shots in our game. He backs away, makes room and dispatches it over cover for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just wide of Tye's outstretched hands running to his left from deep mid-wicket. Had a lot of work to do but was never really going to get to it. Slower ball on a shortish length and {{BATSMAN}} went for the forehand smash. Mistimed it but luckily, got it in the gap. Or nearly in the gap. Doesn't matter how they come as long as they do\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that has been muscled away, think he didn't get it off the middle of the bat, but almost sent the ball over the ropes - backed away to a length ball and went over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 138ks, {{BATSMAN}} thanks him for the pace. Bowled short and in the zone to be ramping it away with an open bat face, times it ever so sweetly does {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, uppish and just past the diving cover fielder! Dhawan tried but it was past him in a flash. Fullish ball and {{BATSMAN}} was committed on the drive, doesn't bother to keep it down but the good thing was that he found the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Class written all over it. A short of length ball at 145.1kph, {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of it and punches it superbly through the covers, beating a diving Chahal\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this was coming - {{BATSMAN}} can't be kept quiet any longer, bends down low and plays a pick-up sweep over backward square leg, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good move by DK to send {{BATSMAN}} at number 3. With two left arm spinners in CSK, he can get a few handy runs. This was wide outside off and {{BATSMAN}} slaps it wide of the fielder at cover, placement was the key on this occasion\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot! It was touch fuller of good length, {{BATSMAN}} lofts it wide of the mid-on fielder for a four. he played that shot with a straight bat and that made it even better. Minimum risk and effective result!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misfield by Mujeeb results in a boundary. {{BOWLER}} isn't pleased one bit with the effort and has his hands on his hips. This was a short and wide delivery that was cut to square third man by {{BATSMAN}}. Mujeeb guarding that region lets it through and gifts four runs to the opposition\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow. Delicate stuff from {{BATSMAN}}. Opens the bat face to this length ball and runs it towards third man, Sanju had to cover some ground, sprinted to his left but couldn't stop the ball from reaching the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed past the stumps at the other end. Too full and {{BATSMAN}} has drilled that in a flash. Rocketed away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, brilliant timing. The ball races away past point. Back of a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} eases onto the back foot and punches it firmly. Good start to the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, excellent placement from {{BATSMAN}}! Uses his feet, gets closer to the pitch of the delivery and whiplashes it over mid-wicket, right in the gap between the fielders in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mistimed shots are finding the gaps now, this was short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was late on the pull, gets a top-edge - the fielder at square leg was inside the ring and {{BATSMAN}} has managed to get it over his head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a thick inside edge is what it is. {{BATSMAN}} just plants his foot down looking to loft it down the ground without being anywhere close to the pitch. It slides in, spoons up off the edge and beats square leg before running away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Chahal at extra cover gave that up very easily. But that was timed so beautifully by {{BATSMAN}}. A back foot punch with a high backlift, hitting the ball on the top of its bounce, the weight going into the shot and powered away. Great start to the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the airrr and just over a leaping Negi. {{BATSMAN}} would've had his heart in his mouth for a moment. A short of length delivery outside off, there was width on offer so {{BATSMAN}} went after for a rasping cut. Didn't bother to keep it down but luckily for him it flies over the point fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bullied past mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} is the designated finisher for {{TEAM}} and he's playing a gem here. Takes toll of this overpitched delivery outside off and places it perfectly in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, an action replay of the previous delivery, only difference? {{BATSMAN}} hit this dead straight. Overpitched, sent racing into the fence with a absolute thwack of the willow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and now {{BOWLER}} drops it short. {{BATSMAN}} uses the depth of the crease and cuts past point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends down and spoons it over the infield, there was a man at deep point but he couldn't get there in time to stop the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, well, well. Smashes his first IPL runs -- getting a juicy short-wide one to crash into, slapping it through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh boy. If 0.3 was timing, this is its square. Pitched up, {{BATSMAN}} strides, flows through with a defensive push. Yeah, that's all. And screeching past mid-off. Wow, Wankhede ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, need to get the short delivery higher, {{BATSMAN}} is waiting for these, clears his front leg and pulls it over mid-wicket, once more just managed to clear the fielder on the edge of the circle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now he is playing with the field. Walked across his stumps to the flighted delivery, sat down and broomed it backward of square leg, struck it fine enough to beat the man in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, precision at its very best! Call it luck or placement, but {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}} won't mind. Attempts the reverse sweep and for a fleeting moment he seemed to have mistimed it, but such is the luck, it flies in the gap between short third and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wrong lines from Trent {{BOWLER}}, pounds it short and sprays it around the ribcage, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and smacks the pull behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, make that two in a row. {{BOWLER}} goes shorter again, {{BATSMAN}} is bred on English soil. Too easy for him, pulls it wide of mid-on. No need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this will ease his nerves a bit. {{BOWLER}} is bowling back of length balls so there was no long-off in place. {{BATSMAN}} moves forward, and lofts it over mid-off. The timing again wasn't great but it was good enough to get it over mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 125.5kph. Juicy stuff sit up on the legs, and {{BATSMAN}}'s just too good to miss out on all this. He swivels, swats hard and nails the backward square leg gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what was Ishant doing? {{BATSMAN}} backed away to the leg-side, {{BOWLER}} followed him with a short and quick delivery, {{BATSMAN}} adjusted and ramped it fine. Ishant at short third man stood like a statue\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, down the track in a flash, right to the pitch of the ball, and driven so beautifully over the covers. The trick in the shot was that he delayed the charge and came out only when the ball was released\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! Once again {{BATSMAN}} plays down the wrong line. He wanted to punch the back of a length delivery and got an inside edge, the ball flies over the stumps and goes away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, on the sweep. Never mind the top-edge, the powerplay is his ally. His stride doesn't quite get him to the pitch of it, the spin's big too. But these big bats allow him to clear square leg, and that's enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky runs but it brings up {{BATSMAN}}'s fifty! Not a bad {{TEAM}} debut for the veteran who has had his moments of luck too. Like this one. Slogged at it and got a thick edge that beat short third man to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pulls the length back, nothing wrong with this one, {{BATSMAN}} opens the face and threads the needle that is the gap in the cover region - touch and class, and away she goes to the deep extra cover fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top-edge and four, tossed up just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went down low on the sweep, didn't get on top of the bounce, but he knew there was no one in the deep, bounces a couple of times and rolls over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smaaashed! Overpitched delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and thumps it over the bowler's head. That went quicker than a bullet to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Gayle at backward point and Badree at third man, you don't expect them to chase a ball down. Slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} relied on placing it behind point rather than knocking the cover off the ball. No chance for both the fielders\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, two good balls followed by a poor one. Fires it down the leg side, {{BATSMAN}} gets his paddle out. Short fine leg fielder is just a spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped! Pooran has put one down. {{BATSMAN}} charges down, gets a bit too close to the flighted delivery and lofts it to long-off, Pooran runs to his left and goes with his hands over his head, never in a position to take it and what's more he allows it to roll into the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top shot! Nothing much wrong with the delivery. Cutter on a length, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and drives on the rise past mid-off, the timing he generated on the slower ball was just amazing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hey Sunil! Gotta move buddy! {{BATSMAN}} went back and pulled this short ball fine, Narine was at short fine leg, he hardly moved, should have tried at least, instead he put his arm out to the man in the deep, who clearly had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, follows up the muscle display with some elegance. Walks into the line, to the pitch of the delivery and shows the maker's name in tonking it down the ground. Into the fence on the bounce. Brings up his half-ton as well. In the first chance he is given\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is straight in {{BATSMAN}}'s alley. Full and outside off, and he is too good with the inside out shots, stays leg-side of the ball and goes over the fielder, couple of bounces and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crashed away! He had been trying to blast it for a while and finally, connects. Wide half-volley and {{BATSMAN}}'s quick hands on display as he thumps this with all his power. Well wide of mid-off who was a mere spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, spoils it, does {{BATSMAN}}. It was turning out to be a good over from {{BOWLER}}. Goes for the quicker ball and messes it up, veering it down leg and {{BATSMAN}} glances it past the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} keeps going. He's batting on another planet out there. The timing off his bat, magnificent. This is a full toss in all fairness, {{BATSMAN}} is deep in the crease, he uses the pace and slices it away through point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, up and over! With mid-off in the ring, perhaps not the ideal length from {{BOWLER}} and he pays the price for it. Fuller ball and allows {{BATSMAN}} to get under it. Lifted cleanly over the fielder who did leap but was never going to get to it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets into an awkward position, but manages to collect a boundary. A short ball that climbs at the batter, but the line was leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}}, despite not being in a great position, managed to get a glove on it. Raced away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, why worry when you can play shots like these? Walks well across his stumps and meets the ball with greatest of ease, chips the punchy on-drive over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} smashes it away over extra cover. Just a hit away now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is picking his gaps for fun here. The full delivery isn't working for him, stays deep in the crease and manages to whip it away to deep mid-wicket, Padikkal has no chance this time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's more like it. Stand and deliver. Gets a length ball in his arc and he gives it his all. In fact it was the knuckle ball and {{BATSMAN}} dispatched it straight back over {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, googly again, {{BATSMAN}} picks it out of the hand, had enough time to pick his spot; just backs away and stabs the ball behind point. Raced away...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nine runs off the opening over! A harmless short ball on leg-stump line, rises up to the hip and that's easy pickings for the Mumbai captain. {{BATSMAN}} plays a one-legged pull shot over backward square leg for a one-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Gets outside the line and sweeps controls the sweep wide of short fine leg for a boundary. The first one of the DD innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tossed up on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was setting himself up for the big slog sweep, gets a thick inside edge and beats the fielder at square leg, rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what an interesting choice of bowler at this stage. {{BOWLER}} for the first time in this tournament, and he's been spanked off the first ball. Short outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slaps him hard through point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's sprayed it around a bit today, has {{BOWLER}}. Short and wide and gives away the boundary to finish the over. Slashed over backward point by {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, classy stuff from {{BATSMAN}}. Nothing much wrong with the delivery. Good length ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} allowed it to do its bit before opening the bat face and directing it past the backward point fielder. Used the pace on the ball and timed it beautifully\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, big over for {{TEAM}}, 16 off it. Overpitched delivery and right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}}, with the form he is, there is no missing out on such freebies, drills the drive wide of mid-off. Did Kohli err in giving {{BOWLER}} a third?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, from over the wicket and that's been pitched full. Right there to be hit. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't even bother about the footwork. Stays put and slamns that through wide mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and now save your heads. {{BOWLER}} dishes out friendly length at this stage, {{BATSMAN}} gets under and puts all his muscle in drilling it straight back. Everyone in the firing line .. and everyone can only jump out. Boundary + the 50-run stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short delivery, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and guides, gets it fine and over the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first signs of audacity. Keep them coming young man! {{BOWLER}} bowls the away swinger but it's a half tracker, {{BATSMAN}} confidently chipped down the track and pulled over wide mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is under pressure and he bowls a poor delivery, ball was outside off, {{BATSMAN}} makes full use of the room and scythes it through backward point for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! The Mumbai captain saw the width outside off and slashed his bat hard. Takes the edge and runs away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} hits the winning runs - it's a boundary! Sixth win of the season for the Delhi Capitals as their captain sends this one away to the deep mid-wicket fence with a fantastic pull shot. Nerves of steel by the young skipper towards the closing stages. {{TEAM}} beat KXIP by 5 wickets\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crash, bang, wallop! Short, fractionally wide, {{BATSMAN}} lashes out at it and finds the gap between short third and backward point for four. Hardest cutter since Sehwag, may I say?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done. {{BOWLER}} errs on the shorter side and {{BATSMAN}} threads the gap behind point with a delicate cut shot. He played it late and that enabled him to bisect backward point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, too full and too wide of off, allows {{BATSMAN}} to free his arms as he scythes it past cover-point, off the mark with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, runs for Delhi! Fired outside off on a yorker length and {{BATSMAN}} once again attempts a similar shot. This one comes off his pads and beats Dhoni as it races away to the boundary. Doesn't matter how these runs come, as long as they do..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and a good ball but a bad result. Squeezed through the third man region for a four. Got bat to ball and almost an educated edge to put it fine past short third for a four. 11 off the over. 31 runs off the 3 last overs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of the bounce and cuts it in front of square on the off-side, beats the man in the ring and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, make that three. {{BATSMAN}} on a carnage. Pitched up further, more of the width and an invite to get back to the business of dispatching these away. Done with another full flowing cover drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four! Would've been swallowed by the first slip fielder, if there was ever one. Lovely flight from {{BOWLER}}, drew {{BATSMAN}} forward and takes the outside edge which runs away through the invisible first slip region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} plants his foot back in the crease and hoists it over extra cover. Extraordinary shot, generating all that power from the bottom hand. Vijay Shankar's diving effort in the deep not enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} welcomes {{BATSMAN}} with a gift by doling out a leg-stump half-volley at 140kph. The skipper, who is in great form, gets off the mark with an easy flick off his pads through backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} hits 151kph as he pounds it in on short of length, and is pulled over midwicket. {{BATSMAN}} didn't quite get hold of it though. Definitely a little rushed for pace. But enough meat on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, kneels down and punishes it away. Gets it past the man at short fine leg and the ball races away between square leg and short fine leg for a four. Very well done. He preempted the angle and got it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no third man. Nor there is short third. Easy shot for {{BATSMAN}}. He reverse-swats the length ball turning away from him wide of backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done! Fullish ball, {{BATSMAN}} gets down and paddle-sweeps it behind square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a gimme from {{BOWLER}}! 144ks slipping down the leg-side, KP helps it on its away with a fine tickle off his pads to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top shot. Gets un{{BATSMAN}}r this full {{BATSMAN}}livery and manages to power it over mid-off. Well wi{{BATSMAN}} of him and four more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beauty! {{BATSMAN}} is in some form. {{BOWLER}} goes full and outside off, gets a hint of outswing too, {{BATSMAN}} though is almost on one knee as he bent forward and then opened the bat-face at the last moment to essay a square drive that left cover-point as a spectator. Not much {{BOWLER}} can do when he gets to see two world-class shots like that. Credit to {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, inswinger which is slightly off target and {{BATSMAN}} puts it away with ease. Full and swinging into the pads, flicked through mid-wicket to open his account. Not a muscle moved\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gift for {{BATSMAN}} and he accepts it with glee. {{BOWLER}} strays on the pads with a half-volley, easily glanced away down to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act. {{BOWLER}} overpitches, {{BATSMAN}} gets down on a knee and flogs it over mid-on. Clean strike for a one-bounce four. 15 runs off the over!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh, he's taking {{BOWLER}} to the cleaners. Streaky this time but {{BATSMAN}} won't mind. Throws his bat on this fuller length delivery outside off and gets a thick outside edge that flies away to the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, away-turner, but the length is on the shorter side and there's too much width outside off. {{BATSMAN}} won't miss out. He rocks back and cuts it fiercely to the right of backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} strays on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} punishes. All {{BATSMAN}} had to do was to beat the short fine fiedler which he did with ease with the flick shot, and it raced to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that went to the fence like a bullet! Oh, my! {{BOWLER}} missed his length and delivered a slot ball, width on offer as well and {{BATSMAN}} won't miss out. Smacks the bones out of this one and it goes on the bounce to the wide long-off fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 140.4km/h, back of a length delivery without width, {{BATSMAN}} backs away into the on-side, gives himself room, and carves it away towards the deep backward point fence for four. NOT a lot of width, but the arm-power made up for it...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drags the ball short, bad ball and put away. The batsman decides to drag the pull behind square and gets it past the man at 45 degrees for a four. {{TEAM}} would take it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 138.8kph. Keeps dishing out pace, keeps it wide outside off and {{BATSMAN}}'s edge will do just as well. There may have been a short third man, but the slice is such that it's very fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and there's just enough pace for {{BATSMAN}} who belts the pull and the best part about this shot is: He made sure he picked the gap to perfection, right between deep square and deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR. Edged. One-bounce. Four. The fluke pays off. {{BATSMAN}} comes dancing down the track and slices the flash-drive off the outside edge. Raced away!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the bat-face opens as {{BATSMAN}} tries to loft a drive over mid-off but he's got enough behind it to skew it over the infield. Gets it away into the extra-cover boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed! It as full and was on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} pumps it down the ground, {{BOWLER}} did well to get his head out of the way. It runs along the carpet for another boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crashes the sweep away behind square. He's doing nothing else, just sweeping. Gets the length he wants and muscles it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, on the pads, he will hit those all day long. All {{BATSMAN}} needed to do was to get bat on ball, tickled away with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully played, will this help {{BATSMAN}} break the shackles? Comes down the track, makes room as he did so and goes inside out over cover, one bounce and over the ropes. 13 came from the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no half measures from {{BATSMAN}} on this occasion. Spots the half-tracker early, chooses his spot and muscles it to the right of deep mid-wicket fielder. One-bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one-handed pull from {{BATSMAN}}. He was deceived by the slower delivery and the bottom hand comes off the bat handle, but the placement is behind square and a desperate dive from Klaasen is not enough to stop the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off the mark with a boundary, although a streaky one. Legbreak outside off, {{BATSMAN}} seeks to drive and feeds a thick outside edge which flies fine past the fielder at short third\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, splits the gap perfectly. {{BOWLER}} goes short once again, {{BATSMAN}} stays low and pulls it through mid-wicket. Beats long-on and deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, has to be the shot of the day so far. Even {{BOWLER}} looks perplexed, this was tossed up nicely outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leant forward, played with the turn and drove it wide of mid-wicket, split the two men in the deep to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first real confident stroke that {{BATSMAN}} has played tonight! Width on offer and he loves that. Stand and deliver on the slap-drive that pierces the gap at cover and blazes away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that should ease his nerves. Slightest of widths outside off and {{BATSMAN}} opens his bat face at the point of impact and punches it through square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length into the body, {{BATSMAN}} wallops a pull through backward square leg. That's rocketed to the fence. Really poor from {{BOWLER}}. He's been consistently short so far\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 120kph, seam up delivery that's short and wide outside off. Definitely surprised {{BATSMAN}} who was late on it, but he managed to get it off the toe-edge. The pace on the ball did the rest as it raced past a helpless short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bludgeoned down the ground! An overpitched delivery around off and {{BATSMAN}} had absolutely hammered it past the bowler, no chance of stopping that. {{BOWLER}} hardly had any time to react\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball sits up for the batsman to hack the pull away and loft it over mid-wicket. The man at long-on was light years away from that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one bounce and over the ropes. {{BATSMAN}} needs to keep going for the final four balls. {{BOWLER}} missed the yorker and {{BATSMAN}} was up for it, deep in the crease and whipping it with a lot of bottom hand to cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} thinks it's a no-ball for height, but wasn't to be. A fair call from the umpire as it was clearly below waist. Full toss again, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and hammers it in the gap between deep mid-wicket and deep square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball outside off and the batsman flogs the ball away with the meaty bottom-hand coming into play. The gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket was easily pierced\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, throws his hands at another ball drifting away and shoots an outside edge over the two fielders behind square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, reverse paddle and gets the ball away past short third man. That was on the sticks and the batsman got it away amidst an appeal from the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, looks as if {{BATSMAN}} has been given the license to express himself. Six balls, six whacks. Stamps his weight on the back foot and powers a biff-drive past a diving mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and now four more. {{BOWLER}} fired that fuller and faster on the stumps, a powerful drive and Warner at mid-off is slightly wide, so can't get there and once he did, didn't dive. {{BATSMAN}} is hurting {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good length delivery outside off, hard length, {{BATSMAN}} runs his hands through a cover drive without any feet and caresses that with sweet timing to the sweeper cover boundary for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, you cannot keep {{BATSMAN}} quiet for long. He gets into business, full at 146kph, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and bludgeons it back over the bowler's head. Brutal from Maxi!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 123.7kph, harmless short of length ball. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't need second invitations to put it away. The right-hander stands tall, fetches it from outside off and pulls it fiercely in front of square on the leg-side. Off the mark with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, horrible wide delivery, the freebies will come with time. {{BATSMAN}} had to really reach out, all he did was just put bat on ball and find the middle, slapped wide of cover and it teases the fielders\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more! Safest shot to play is hit it down the ground. Sees the length on a fuller side and lofts it down the ground, left of the bowler and right of mid-on. Safe shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}}-show at the PCA continues! {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker this time, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it, makes room, keeps shape and powers it wide of long-off! Amazing bat speed!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} sports an \"Ooohhhh,\" with a wry smile on his face. This wasn't a bad delivery. Full and swinging away outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} drives without moving his feet, sends it to the right of mid-off and it races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what's the point of bowl a full ball in the slot with a new ball if you are not a swing bowler? This just came so slowly, {{BATSMAN}} said thank you very much and smoked it over the bowler's head. Oh {{TEAM}} are loving this!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now anticipates a slightly fuller length, walks across the stumps and sweeps over short fine leg. Class batting from {{BATSMAN}}. He's out-thinking {{BOWLER}} at every turn\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed. He is playing with the mind of the bowler. This time backs away, makes room for himself and cuts it past cover for a boundary. Great timing and equally good placement\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just a push..may be an exagerrated punch. But that raced away across the turf past the man at cover. Whatta shot. Not a pushover for sure\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, right in between deep mid-wicket and deep backward square. The short ball sits up for {{BATSMAN}}, who swivels on the back foot and though he pulls in the air, he hits the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a terrible full-toss at a gentle 133.1km/h, and {{BATSMAN}} lays into it, caressing it through the covers for four. Nobody moved...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how cheeky from {{BATSMAN}}? Sees the full ball outside off, waits in his crease and lets his hands take over. Opens his bat face and dinks it in the pocket between short third man and point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, how quick is this outfield! Or is the timing by {{BATSMAN}}? Fullish on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} nicely flicks it through mid-wicket. Beats short mid-wicket and deep mid-wicket with his perfect timing on this flick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smacked hard! {{BATSMAN}} having some fun here. Another overcooked delivery from {{BOWLER}} with width on offer, blasted away through extra cover and well wide of long-off. Handy runs for {{TEAM}} to reduce the margin of defeat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy pickings! Short ball and down the leg side, around the hip and all {{BATSMAN}} had to do is get some bat on it. Glances it very fine and the fielder in the deep was way too square to cut this down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drops it short and that helped the batsman as he was backing away. Drop kicks the ball over the off-side for a four. Much needed for Faf and {{TEAM}}. Breaking the shackles moment?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, over the infield! Fuller this time and {{BATSMAN}} wisely goes over cover. With the spin and the loft is clean. This stroke should give him confidence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overpitched and {{BATSMAN}} just essays a lovely cover drive. Gentle step forward and then the free flow of the bat, he ball bounced over cover-point, that tells you how good the square is. A batsman's paradise it should be\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, too short and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it in front of square, beats mid-wicket and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, two was the call from {{BATSMAN}} as he hit this but he's got enough power to get this all the way to the fence. Slower short ball, he tried to muscle it with all his might and forced this through the gap at mid-wicket. Bisected the big gap on the leg-side and though the mid-wicket fielder tried to get across, he couldn't\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, woah! This is a very uncharacteristic from {{BATSMAN}}. Kohli-esque wristy flick. Very full and around off, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and twirls his wrists at the nth minute to clip it nonchalantly through mid-wicket. All swag from the {{TEAM}} skipper!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful placement! Tossed up generously from {{BOWLER}} but it's too wide and {{BATSMAN}} executes the inside out lofted stroke with finesse. There was a man at long-off but he's got this well wide of that man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smacked away by {{BATSMAN}}! Got down on his knees and swept this hard in front of square through the leg-side. Sandeep got across with a slide but couldn't palm it away properly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's one helluva way to open your account! Leg-break outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lofts it inside-out and gets off the mark with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, these runs will be hurting Bangalore. {{BOWLER}} is just spearing them in and missing the yorkers, another full toss and {{BATSMAN}} looks to heave it to the leg-side, the leading edge balloons over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, innovative and effective from {{BATSMAN}}. Crouches as he stands outside leg-stump, Bhuvi does well to follow him, but {{BATSMAN}} uses the pace to slice the cut over short third man. Just that subtle adjustment of the bat face...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's too much width and can't expect to get away by bowling such fodder. {{BATSMAN}} uses {{BOWLER}}'s pace to slash it away through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played, {{BATSMAN}} brings out the reverse sweep - bends down low and gets enough bat to clear short third man - was the leg-break and he played with the turn\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely bowled but even better played by {{BATSMAN}}, raises his fifty as well. {{BOWLER}} saw {{BATSMAN}} backing away, followed him with a full ball. {{BATSMAN}} makes room, plays with an open face and drives it through cover, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full, gives it a bit of air outside off, in the slot for {{BATSMAN}}, who shimmies down, makes a bit of room, and punches that through deep extra cover for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short one from round the wicket , cross-seamer, {{BATSMAN}} opens up his stance and clubs that pull away to wide long-on for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just over. A mistimed shot that clears the backtracking mid-off fielder. Slanted across off, {{BATSMAN}} made a bit of room and sliced the drive over Siraj, who put in a desperate dive and still couldn't get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full on the pads, CYA TOMORROW! KP was quick to pounce, just needed to help the ball and he did that with some ease, past square leg with courtesy a magical wristwork\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bangs it in short seeing {{BATSMAN}} advance, but is still spanked away into the boundary. He's got himself in that kind of zone, where most things are disappearing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has his first boundary. Delhi need him to fire and fire quickly. Picks the fullish length and just lofts through the line, clears mid-on quite comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first boundary for {{BATSMAN}}. Lucky to be still out there though. This was a full length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} swings hard at it and gets an inside edge, past the stumps and beats the fielder at short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and Mumbai take off with Punjab's momentum. Gets a delivery nipping onto the pads and tickles it away fine enough to go all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a gimme! No room for error when you are bowling to Jos {{BATSMAN}}. He likes it short and gets some width to work too, just stands back and stabs the ball through the off-side ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now shows his intelligence by sweeping wide of short fine leg. Knows deep square is too square and won't get there, got outside the line and knelt down to play the sweep well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has controlled that shot brilliantly and it will fetch him four. It was slower down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} picks it up early, waits for it to arrive, gets on top of it and half-pulls it wide of fine leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky, gets inside the line of this googly and paddles it past the man at short fine leg, this is clever batting from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's getting into his stride now. An upper-cut over backward point for four. {{BOWLER}} goes short outside off, it's not a very safe delivery with third man up. It's not a safe delivery at all. {{BATSMAN}} keeps his shape, doesn't go very hard and just glides it over the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky and four, on a good length and from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} was late in getting his bat down, squirted off the inside edge and past short fine, runs away to the ropes in a hurry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}, fraction too short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, gets his left leg out of the way and clatters it to the left of point, no stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, almost prised out {{BATSMAN}} with his first ball. Fuller and straightened just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was pushing forward without any intent and feeds an outside edge which beats MS to his left and runs away to the third man boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there we go. {{BATSMAN}} isn't to be denied for too long. A bit shorter than the previous couple of deliveries, and {{BATSMAN}} pulls it away to the fine leg boundary. One bounce and over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball which swings away from {{BATSMAN}}. He gets down low, uses the swing and slices it past short third man. Wonderful batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets his line wrong. Gets his length wrong. A yorker in the form of a half volley, the line stays on middle and {{BATSMAN}}'s hoick gets a fat inside edge, through his legs and through a vacant square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! That was superbly played. Wasn't a bad ball from {{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}}. A good length ball on off, {{BATSMAN}} went deep in his crease and that allowed him to free his arms. Plays the back-cut perfectly to beat a diving backward point fielder to his left. Third man was inside the circle as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{TEAM}} need more of these. The start doesn't justify the surface on offer, yes CSK bowled tight, but they could have had more runs. This is full and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} on-drives and beats mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Steven {{BATSMAN}} gets off the mark in an emphatic fashion. Shortish ball at 132.6kph that sits up nicely for the Australian. {{BATSMAN}} moves back and across to pull it through square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} shortens his length, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it from the crease and uses his wrists to elevate it over extra cover. Didn't quite middle it, but had enough to get it over Gowtham\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, power from one end and finesse from the other - perfect combination. A low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} just had to put it in the gap, he leans forward and creams the drive through extra cover - splitting the two fielders\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh outside edge and it's flew past the man at slip. Outswinger from a good length, {{BATSMAN}} tries to defend, gets a thick edge and gets away with it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Eden Gardens is loving it. Fearsome striking by {{BATSMAN}}. No margin for error at all, {{BOWLER}} errs by giving him the width, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and crashes it through extra cover. Fierce!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stand and deliver! Everyone's admiring the shot including the bowler. Tad short in length and {{BATSMAN}} bludgeons it over mid-wicket. Almost went the distance such was the timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Punjab leaking runs towards the closing stages. Their bowlers are running out of ideas. This was slightly wide outside off and {{BATSMAN}} slams it through deep extra cover for another scintillating boundary. {{BOWLER}} stands there in disbelief\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another off-cutter from {{BOWLER}} and this time, {{BATSMAN}} was ready for it. He hangs back and smashes it over the in-field on the off-side for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} who smears it away through extra cover. Excellent finish to the over from the captain. Hammered this drive to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, imparts his powers of guiding the edge where he wants. Is happy to stay away from the line, giving his long levers some breathing space and just slashes at a slanter. An obvious outside edge and an even more obvious empty cordon for some free runs here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, with Bhuvi maintaining pressure, it's important {{BOWLER}} backs up but he's spraying the ball around looking for that perfect outswinger starting outside leg and ending off stump, this leg-side freebie flicked wide of short fine leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he is playing a cameo here, is Jaddu. It was an off-cutter, there was just a little bit room. {{BATSMAN}} waits for it to arrive, opens the face of the blade at the last moment and guides it wide of short third man for a boundary. Exemplary placement!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, offers room on this slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to capitalize, he waits before unleashing the cut shot over backward point, no one in the deep to stop that. Much needed boundary for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's squeezed this in the gap. There were three fielders behind square on the off-side - point, backward point and short third man, yet {{BATSMAN}} finds the gap. Can't blame the bowler for bowling a wide yorker, he bowled to the field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ominous! Whoa, the bloke is looking in sync from ball one. Got forward to this fuller one and just eased it past the bowler. Just a mere push and such was the timing that it raced away, beating mid-on comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cross-batted heave from {{BATSMAN}}. The angle was taking it across him but he took his chance, did not get it off the middle. But had enough to beat the man running from deep square leg to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's taking down RCB single handedly, is he? Remember he scored the fastest IPL fifty against the same opposition last year (a record that was broken by a manic Rahul earlier today). Comes down the wicket and slaughters this one past mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky! But that is the way {{BATSMAN}} plays. Short and outside off, he just threw the kitchen sink at it and the top-edge flies over a leaping Karthik. Big over for {{TEAM}}, but the loss of Brathwaite would hurt them\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smart from {{BOWLER}} but Karun is smarter. Slower and short outside off, probably foxed the batsman initially but he adjusted well in the end. Stood tall and waited before guiding it past short third man. Mishra was probably a bit slow as well to come down on the slide and {{BOWLER}} clearly wasn't happy with the effort\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, room offered outside off and {{BATSMAN}}'s sliced it without fuss to the third man boundary. That will do\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, CdG comes on and serves up a short and wi{{BOWLER}} {{BOWLER}}livery outsi{{BOWLER}} off, again {{BATSMAN}} shows off his cutting skills. Plays it late and gets it to the right of backward point. No chance for third man who is pretty square, well placed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} steps to the leg-side to add to the width that was on offer and carves it over extra cover. {{TEAM}} have raced to 44 in four overs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fired down leg, {{BATSMAN}} steps across, laps it away with a fine sweep towards fine leg for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mid-off inside the circle and the batsman gets under the fullish ball to nail it over mid-off. That is something {{TEAM}} would take with open arms\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, horrible bowling and that is putting it mildly. Rank long hop outside off and this time {{BATSMAN}} does not miss out, he waits and holds his shape to slap it over extra cover, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, turns out to be a 12-run over, just what {{TEAM}} wanted to get that momentum back. On the leg stump was the slower delivery, no one at fine leg and a gentle glance was all that was required\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done. {{BOWLER}} slips one down the leg. {{BATSMAN}} goes low and helps it down to fine leg. Fine leg was inside the circle and the ball raced away to the fence in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, uppishly pulled in front of deep backward square where Krunal Pandya charges in for the catch. Tough to say whether it carried, probably didn't, and because all his efforts were directed at going for the catch, he's not able to save the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR. No pace. {{BATSMAN}} picked the bones out it. Shuffles towards the line of the ball and smears it in the gap between mid-off and extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, all over! Bittersweet win for {{TEAM}} at home to finish off the season, as they manage to avoid the wooden spoon - that was to be RCB's destiny this time. It's a very full ball that's swatted over mid-on to the boundary for four to seal a consolation win for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} joins the party now. Length ball from {{BOWLER}}, horror stuff at this stage of the innings and it's heaved away over the gap at mid-wicket. Struck really hard\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 125.3kph. Top hands, and {{BATSMAN}} lets them overcompensate for the lack of feet. Leans back, lets it get close and steers his drive square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just to tell people that he can hit it over the off-side too. It was a slower one wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} delays his bat swing just a little bit and powers it wide of long-off for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this will hurt RCB! Nothing wrong with the ball, just a fraction short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and punches it in front of square on the off-side, splits the gap past cover and rolls away to the fence. {{TEAM}} are off to a flier once again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} puts bat to ball and it skims away through the covers. Didn't go too hard on the drive, just focused on timing which was spot on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is looking unstoppable at the moment! Picks the arm-ball, settles on one knee and paddles it fine of the fielder at short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pinged off the middle! {{BATSMAN}} starting from where he left off in his previous game in Jaipur. Waits for the length delivery to swing in and presents full face of the bat and massages the drive through extra cover. Sheer timing!!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 136ks length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} picks it up from wide of off and swats it over Bravo at mid-on, easy pickings for the batsman\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ahh, the form he is in! Lovely shot by Surya there. Was a length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waited for it and opened the face of the bat real late. Gets it past the man at wide slip to find the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, bonus runs! It's an IPL debut for Simran {{BOWLER}} and this won't do much to his confidence, that's for sure. Was a slower ball from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to hoick across the line. Got beaten by the lack of pace and it went on the bounce to Simran {{BOWLER}} who just couldn't cover the line as it sneaked past him to the fence. Don't want to be gifting easy runs to the opposition, not in such high-pressure games\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slapped! That was powered down the ground. Not too far from the bowler, not too far from the sticks and the ball escaped into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top shot! Short of length, {{BATSMAN}} rides the bounce and punches it beautifully through extra cover, the fielder at mid-off was a touch too straight and had no chance of stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another edge and another four. Shortish and moved away just enough, {{BATSMAN}} swings his bat and gets an outside edge which loops over the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crisp, length ball and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans into the drive, plays it on the up and past the fielder at mid-off, nice way to get going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now the finesse. Banged in and the ball was climing around off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} arches back and ramps it over de Kock, one bounce and over the ropes. Rohit looks worried!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more. Two short balls in a row from {{BOWLER}}. He'll be disappointed by this. Googly on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} picks length early, gets down low and swats it through backward square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, abandons the niceties of 1s and 2s and unfurls his strong bottom hand here. Leans forward, extends his hands and cracks the drive through extra cover. Fielder in the deep gave a chase but in vain. Sublime!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slapped through extra cover. {{BOWLER}} goes full, overpitches it in the process just outside off. {{BATSMAN}} stays deep and creams it hard, beats a desperate dive from Chahar at sweeper cover. Flawless timing from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dispatches the first delivery of {{BOWLER}} for a boundary. It was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} plunges forward and tonks it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary. It spilts the gap to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, tad short and keeps eerily low on middle, but {{BATSMAN}} does well to keep his eyes on the ball and slam the pull along the ground through mid-wicket. A diving effort by the fielder at deep mid-wicket goes in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no spin on this, {{BATSMAN}} uses his long levers and muscles it to the left of long-on, Faf tried his best to get behind the ball but {{BATSMAN}}, perhaps, timed it too well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice batting! Moved slightly towards leg-side as the bowler was running to deliver the ball. That allowed him to free his arms. Shortish ball and {{BATSMAN}} cracked it over cover-point. Powerfully hit and in the gap as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is unleashing himself! Full and outside off, not the slower ball and {{BATSMAN}} is across the stumps in a flash to play his typical pickup stroke. Dhawan at deep backward square leg tried to get across but couldn't\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shortish off-break, erring in line, drifting into the pads, whipped away off the back foot to the backward square leg fence for four. Threaded the needle there...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what do you do when your big brother plays shots like that. Just stand and admire at the other end. Hardik {{BATSMAN}} restricted to a spectator role this over and rightly so. Half-volley from {{BOWLER}}, deserved to be punished, {{BATSMAN}} lashes it through covers making life difficult for the fielders inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, so starts with a slower delivery that decks away and ironically allows {{BATSMAN}} the room to slap it off the back foot. Through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky. But the runs keeps leaking. Does it really matter how. Wide, half way down the track and {{BATSMAN}} anticipates the ball to fizz up in flat batting it across. There's barely any climb, and all he gets is the inside edge to impart the direction in guiding it just past the sticks\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} gets lucky. It was a short of length delivery on the body, he was taken aback by how sharply it lifted off the deck and was too early on the pull shot. Gets it off the glove and just clears the keeper for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third boundary of the over. {{BOWLER}} is not learning. This was much straighter, he is looking for some swing which is non existent at the moment. Full on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and tickles it away to the fine leg fence. The fielder was inside the ring and {{BOWLER}} shouldn't have bowled it there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! Stand and deliver stuff from {{BATSMAN}}. It was the normal speed delivery and right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} didn't have to move much, extends his arms and lofts it straight back over {{BOWLER}}. A much needed boundary for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air but wide of backward point, short delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} cuts hard, the fielder jumped to his right inside the circle but it was well past him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, to be a cutter or to not be a cutter, that isn't the question. This was wide, and it's been cut away through backward point. Life's simple\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, keeps low and nutmegs DK, {{BATSMAN}} didn't pick it, neither did the keeper, runs are runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is probably the blunder which will cost KKR the match. It shouldn't have been any more than a single. A low full toss which {{BATSMAN}} can't find any elevation with. He smacks it down to long-on, where Surya attacks the ball nicely but he misfields and the ball sneaks through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length delivery wide of off, it's a slower ball but on this pitch, it has come on so brilliantly onto the bat. {{BATSMAN}} has just opened the face, that's it, but it's sped away through backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this flies squarer but he's middled it again somewhat. Swivels a little, carting the ball round the corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, so he bowls three dots, there is this urge to get your name in the wickets column, especially in this format and in this tournament, so {{BOWLER}} tries the fancy slower ball when back of a length was perfectly working for him, {{BATSMAN}} pounces on the short delivery and powers the pull over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is aware of the field. Perhaps realised another short ball was coming. Moved away to the leg-side, opened himself up and ramps it over short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's played the field there. So aware of the men around him. The slip is wide and the third man is not covering for him. Uses the pace and opens the face of the bat to bisect the keeper and Williamson\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, timed to perfection that was. Short of a length delivery angled away with a bit of away swing too, {{BATSMAN}} sits back in his crease and punches it through the gap at cover. Was in the air for a while but the placement was pretty good\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, creamed, low full-toss from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, leans forward and punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats cover-point and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Williamson pulls off a blinder, almost. Good length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes ahead with his lofted shot and miscues it over mid-off, Williamson goes back running, extends his right arm but can't take the catch, the ball crawls away to the long-off boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunched away! Too full from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} lays into the drive, smashes it towards wide long-off where Karun put in a desperate slide. Got a hand on it but couldn't stop it cleanly. First boundary for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, sloppy from Ishan Kishan once again, low full-toss on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he was looking to flick and missed, went fine and to the right of the keeper. Kishan was late on the dive and lets the ball slip through for four leg-byes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is going to play his shots. Premeditated and makes good contact. A powerful reverse-sweep and strikes cleanly. Got it over short third man and there is no one to stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, glorious way to kick-start your innings. Outswinger from {{BOWLER}}, too short and swinging away outside off. {{BATSMAN}} stands tall, hands following and creams it stylishly through extra cover. {{TEAM}}'s captain is off and running\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's short once more from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} shows how it's done. Belts the pull away over midwicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Karn Sharma might have saved a few for CSK. {{BOWLER}} errs in line, on the hips and {{BATSMAN}} glances it towards fine leg. Karn was square and had a lot of ground to cover, he runs to his left and puts in the full length dive, flicks the ball in play. Third umpire has a look and sees that he is in contact with the ad cushions, first boundary off the final\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, as if the choice of bowling {{BOWLER}} wasn't enough, the bowlers chooses a full ball to bowl. Clattered over mid-wicket with a disparaging whip. Enough. No one in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first fifty of the season for {{BATSMAN}}. He's making a day out of Markande's drop. Another short ball, {{BATSMAN}} stays front-footed and heaves that over mid-wicket. Gloriously weird shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third four in that area between backward point and short third. Delicately steering it in the gap, beating the dive of backward point. Simmons did his best but couldn't stop it. Raced away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fine leg was inside the circle and {{BATSMAN}} gets four. Gets inside the line and then waits for the off-pace delivery which is short, pulled well wide of short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shawt! Width on offer and no great pace either, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out for it and slaps it through cover-point. Hat-trick of boundaries for the opener\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superb shot! {{BATSMAN}} is in some form and this shot is a reflection of it. {{BOWLER}} went wide of the crease to cut off room but {{BATSMAN}} backed away a touch to drive this inside out through extra cover. Bisected the deep fielders well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky and effective for {{BATSMAN}}. Cleverly arches his back on seeing this short ball outside off, opens his bat face and elevates it over first slip. One bounce and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, It is a four, and it's been dropped in the deep by the captain, can you believe it! Crazy scenes here at the Kotla. This is going down to the last ball, it was on a fuller length and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} flaunts his hitting prowess and hits the ball over long-on, timing wasn't great and Iyer at long-on spills it. Right through his hands there. Couldn't close the palms, the ball rips through it and bounces once before tagging the boundary ropes. Maxwell is around too, standing close-in and watching everything. Tries to slap the rebound off the ground into the playing area but fails to get a hand. Four! Six needed off the last ball!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, too full and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward, doesn't bend down completely and plays a half-arm sweep past mid-wicket, bisects the two men in the deep to a nicety\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, bad idea Kumar. Arrows it on leg-stump line, {{BATSMAN}} swivels 360 and hacks it over square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's nicely played. Didn't try to over-hit the ball, flighted delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and drives along the ground, beats AB's dive to his right at mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the horrors of a short-wide combo. {{BATSMAN}} arches back, throws his hands out and smashes a cut wide of backward point's left reach\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, seam-up short ball wide of off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} waits and opens the bat face to ramp it over short third. Smart batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more! Once again, {{BATSMAN}} moves leg-side, opens up the off-side and cuts it fiercely behind square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full and very wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and slices it over backward point. {{BATSMAN}} is turning the tables now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good start to the over, some glove love as well between Bhuvi and Rashid. Short and outside off, Bhuvi arches back and carves the cut over backward point. No one out there to stop that from reaching the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, second boundary of the over! Not a great start by {{BOWLER}}. Darts this one around off and {{BATSMAN}} thumps it through the gap at covers once again. The outfield is lightning quick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drilled ferociously past mid-off. That should dent {{BOWLER}}'s confidence. Pitches it up outside off, it's a tasty half-volley and {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act, hammering it past mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the middle of all the power here comes the deft touches. Opens up his bat very late and uses up the iota of width in running it through the cordon\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, top edge but it's nearly gone all the way! Cons of having pace! Good fiery bumper from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} is clearly late on the pull. But he knew that fine leg was up and hence, there wasn't much risk on the stroke. Eventually fetches a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 140ks, short and wide. What does {{BATSMAN}} do? No feet, just uses the leeway and forehand smacks it dead straight, over the umpire and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower one @117km/h, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it, calm as a cucumber (maybe change the idiom to Dhoni), steers it away to deep backward point for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! He's playing a gem here. Bhuvi misses the yorker by a couple of inches and that is enough for {{BATSMAN}}, he opens the bat face and square drives it to the fence. Sweeper had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too short and {{BATSMAN}} did well to get under that and thump it over the leaping fielder at mid-wicket to take pressure off after those dots\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four to finish the over. And partnership between the pair is 50 now. It was a back of a length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it to arrive and tonks it really hard over mid-off for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played, loopy delivery wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets a good stride forward and goes inside out over cover, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor finish to the over. Too short and too wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} goes back and opens his bat face to lace it past point. Sweeper cover tries his best but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a rare loose delivery by Punjab tonight. {{BOWLER}} darts this one outside off on a shorter length and {{BATSMAN}} makes the use of the width on offer. Reaches out for it and slices it past the fielder at point. No fielders in the deep and that shall be the second boundary of the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first one of the innings for Robbie. Stays put and times his loft right over the bowler's head. The man in the deep was a bit wide and even if he was fine, wouldn't be able to stop it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, quintessential Suresh {{BATSMAN}} inside-out loft over extra cover. Anyone surprised? He does this so often and that too off the first ball of the over. Makes room and goes bang off the middle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not where he intended to hit that but he'll take it. Another short delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} takes his eyes off the ball and pulls, ends up getting an inside edge past the fielder at short fine leg and finds the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slapped over extra cover! That went like a bullet. {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the pitch and {{BOWLER}} shortens his length. There's ample width and {{BATSMAN}} flayed it powerfully!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's a sweeper cover in place, but he can't do nothing about it. Full and wide outside off and {{BATSMAN}} creams it past the fielder with impeccable timing and incredible placement\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunched away! Good length delivery angled away from the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and slams that through the gap at point, lightning speed on that as the batsman gets his first boundary, on the first ball. Positive start for the southpaw\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} seems to have gained tremendously from his fifty the other day. He's playing with a good amount of confidence and fluency. Back of a length outside off, he punches it away with flair past backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just over. For a second {{BATSMAN}} would have had his heart in his mouth. The full length delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} stays leg-side and toe-ends the loft over Rohit at mid-off. He was standing well inside the circle. Had he been on the edge, he would have gobbled that up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Jonny, you champion! He can't do nothing wrong at the moment. Waits for the slower one, delays his bat swing and tonks it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overpitched and {{BATSMAN}} drills it straight down the ground between the sticks and the non-striker, long-on and long-off had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is underway! Fullish ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and throws the kicthen sink. Sliced over point and the Universe Boss collects his first boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, strays on the hip and {{BATSMAN}} picks it away wide of short fine leg. {{BOWLER}} isn't very pleased by the effort. Basically there was no effort\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cheeky from AB, a pre-meditated lap sweep, bends down low, uses the pace on the ball and laps it past the keeper for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good looking shot. {{BOWLER}} pitches it up and {{BATSMAN}} meets it with a straight-batted drive. The bowler can't stop it and the mid-on fielder can't get there with a dive. Races away into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, unlucky for the bowler but {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}} won't mind. Shuffled miles across his off-stump to try the funky paddle-scoop over the keeper, but {{BOWLER}} sprayed it too far outside off to foil his plans, result? It flies past the helpless keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clears the in-field with ease. This is fearless cricket from {{BATSMAN}}. It was missing from his game when he was the skipper. It was in the slot for him on a fuller length and he hoicks it over mid-on for another four\n",
            "San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one-han{{BATSMAN}}d back foot square drive. On a short of length outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} didn't intentionally pull the bottom hand off, but it raced off the middle and split cover-point and backward point. AB is in the mood tonight\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, swings one way the ball goes completely in the opposite direction. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to hack to the leg-side but the thick outside edge flies over and wide of Pant\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} flat-bat thrashes that, didn't hit it really sweetly, but enough to beat long-off running to his left. Looks to be finding his touch. Had to after my earlier comments about him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, FOUR, slashed away! Not that short, neither too full. Sets up for {{BATSMAN}} who makes use of the slight width and flashes it over point. No ball. Free hit coming!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} moves into the nineties. Short, aiming at the body. No problems for {{BATSMAN}}, who gets into a strong position and pulls it witheringly through mid-wicket. No chance for the fielder in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, steps outside the leg stump again, {{BOWLER}} follows him again but he errs with his length this time. It's too full. Du {{BATSMAN}} lofts it over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a tennis forehand, Roger would have been proud of that. It was a good length delivery and was just wide of off, nothing wrong with the delivery. But {{BATSMAN}} flat-bats it wide of the bowler and the timing was so good that it canters to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ordinary delivery from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} is all over it. The young man is shaking his head while taking his cap from the umpire. Half tracker which sat up nicely for {{BATSMAN}}, who pulls it between deep mid-wicket and long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, comical from KW. He hasn't realised that the ball has crossed the fence. Keeps running and then belatedly realises. But what a good pull shot that is. Rocketed off the bat, harmless short ball around waist height, {{BATSMAN}} murdered that and bisected the two men on the fence. Even a dive wasn't enough to stop the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, heaved away! The length is wrong from {{BOWLER}} this time, gives one in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} who is ready to throw his bat at anything that's within his reach. Clubs it through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, unleashes the anger. In the slot, the juicy length and {{BATSMAN}} smacks it through the line. Doesn't hold a muscle back in his bat swing as he forehands it over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, offers pace and width, {{BATSMAN}} will feed on that all day, he cracks the back cut behind point and pace on the ball meant it raced away to the fence beating third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full on off and middle, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it uppishly over the mid-wicket fielder. Not timed well enough but has enough fuel to collect himself a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slower ball but {{BATSMAN}} waits, as if he knew what was coming, and drives uppishly over extra cover. Not off the middle but does the job for him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, highish elbow, weight into the shot and a Test-matchesque shot gets the batsman a serene four. That was pitched up and the rest was done by {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, It goes through everyone. It was a short of length delivery, keeps low, {{BATSMAN}} was taken aback by the low bounce. He fails to get any bat to it. It misses the leg-stump by a whisker and the low bounce beats Pant too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, keeps them in the hunt. Gets low on a knee and throws the bat out in carving it square. In the gap too. 19 needed off 4\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} finishes off in style. Very full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} crouches low, opens the bat face and drives it square on the off-side, the field was up and that was played beautifully\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a gift and {{BATSMAN}} accepts it gleefully. Half-volley on off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} takes it from there and flicks it fiercely past mid-on. Rockets away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 134.1kph. Sitting up in the slot, nicely getting onto the hips at a good height for {{BATSMAN}} to latch. Does it with a swiping glance, getting airborne and pinching the mid-wicket gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good shot to open your account. He relied more on power than timing. Clears the front leg and hammers a length ball through extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more grace, and rubbed in with more CSK misery. A very short arm drill, leaning back and generating a lot of power to pump it just in front of long-off's ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a quality stroke from Mann. Hint of width and he latches onto it in a flash. Riding the bounce and punching it with all grace and flair - threading the gap between cover-point and point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, vintage {{BATSMAN}}. Shuffles outside his off-stump and hacks one into the deep backward square area. The key was he watched the ball till the last minute and ensured he dropped the stroke in no-man's land\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, over mid-off. And by a long way. Goes through the line and lofts it disdainfully there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, the quicker ball from {{BOWLER}}, but the length was short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and beats the man at point with a fierce cut\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, {{BOWLER}} has been too full this over, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward, gets close to the ball and drills it back past the non-striker, even a big dive at long-off can't stop the ball, it was Prasidh there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets his bat down on a shortish ball at the last moment and places it well past the man at short third fielder for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, dropped! A relatively easy chance by Jadeja's standards. DK muscles the pull and it was hit flat to the right of the fielder at deep mid-wicket, Jaddu got there quickly but the momentum was always taking him to his right and he seemed to have lost the trajectory momentarily as he tried to take it in front of his face. Sneaks through his fingers and travels to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off the back foot and over mid-off. This is great exhibition of batting from the West Indian. Short of a length just outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} lofts nicely from the middle of the bat and collects his sixth boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, round the wicket, fires it in flat on a length, {{BATSMAN}} steps across and just whip-jabs it with a checked followthrough (or lack thereof) over the fielder at square leg inside the circle for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's box-office chic and very good thinking. Short ball angled across, {{BATSMAN}}'s ducking initially, then sees that the height isn't much and ramps that over to the third man fence with utter style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, what was Kedar Jadhav doing? {{BATSMAN}} was beaten all ends up, tees off for a big mow to the leg-side, the ball goes on straight to beat him on the inside edge. Jadhav didn't even try to get his gloves behind the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, vintage. Typical. Backs away, makes a lot of room and slices it inside-out over cover. Timing, placement don't really get better\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is belting it to all corners. Poor bowling from {{BOWLER}}, gives plenty of width on offer outside off and that's been smashed over cover in a jiffy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stays back, {{BATSMAN}} pulls it behind square. That was once again short and punished by {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, french-cut by {{BATSMAN}} as he swings hard and gets an inside edge on the full toss. The fielder at fine leg was inside the ring, hence this was an easy boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wasn't middled. Pitched up on a full length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles a bit and gives it all. Throws his bat at it and gets the outside edge beat the man at third man. No chance of stopping that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 200-up for {{TEAM}}. Magnificent shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Engineers room by backing away to leg and lifts it over cover-point. The ball has enough legs to reach the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, normal pace short ball, {{BATSMAN}} swings into a pull and it takes a thick top-edge to fly over the wicketkeeper. {{TEAM}} just about stay in it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not sure if he intened to go there. Fuller length ball swinging in on leg, {{BATSMAN}}'s bat turns at the point of impact as he looks to on-drive. The ball races away to deep square leg off the inside half of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fundamental error! The ball lands on the practice wickets and skids. Siraj at third man took it easy and the skid off the ground had enough pace to burst through the hands of the fielder. {{BATSMAN}} picked up the short ball and slashed it for the ball to race away off the outer-half of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh, gosh. How did {{BATSMAN}} manage to get this wide of mid-off. Lost timing totally as he went chasing for a drive to an outswinger slanted outside off. Way too early into the shot and canned it off the inner half, evades mid-off who refuses it put in a dive. All the way and {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark with a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} continues to bowl quick, errs in line once again. Down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} glances it fine past the man at 45\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that backlift. And then that drive on the up. So damn predictable. With mid-off in the circle, these are serious runs being leaked\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a half-tracker wide of off. {{BATSMAN}} fetches it and shovels it wide of long-on. {{BOWLER}} under pressure straightaway after an ordinary first over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, much needed boundary for {{TEAM}}! Length ball on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and flicks it effortlessly backward of square on the on-side and collects his first boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, have run out of adjectives to describe this masterclass by {{BATSMAN}}. Was a full length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} gets into position early and scoops it over short third man with an angled bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another terrific shot, his back leg was flying when he attempted that shot. And white cherry was flying too. Picks up the slower one quickly, delays his bat swing and lifts it over mid-off for another four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time well over short fine. The keeper is up and {{BOWLER}} bowls a full length delivery just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and nicely scoops it away over Bhuvi and the ball races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, shot! {{BATSMAN}} moves leg-side and {{BOWLER}} follows him and darts it in. {{BATSMAN}} crouches low and smacks it with a sweep through backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, full and angling across the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} saw the width and went hard on the drive, gets a thick edge that flies through the vacant slip region - a desperate dive from Sarfaraz near the third man rope, but he can only palm it to the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, He is timing the ball really well. {{BATSMAN}} goes inside the line of the ball and slog sweeps it over short fine leg for a boundary\n",
            "Na{{BATSMAN}}em to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there he goes. De {{BATSMAN}} is un{{BATSMAN}}rway. Walks across the stumps, gets down low and wallops the sweep through square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ouch! Has Tye hurt himself badly there? A rank full toss from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} pummels the slog through mid-wicket. Tye at deep mid-wicket sprints to his right and puts in an awkward dive. The ball deflects off his body and runs away into the fence. Has he done his shoulder there? Hope nothing is serious. He goes off the field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, about time we saw a half-volley. All he had to do was stay leg-side of the ball and deflect it with an open bat face. Does so, and it's a boundary through cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, strokes it on the rise but it beats Rohit's dive at mid-off. Fullish just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} hammers it hard and luckily the ball teasingly evades the MI skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, looks to follow {{BATSMAN}} and spills a half-volley on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} brings his bottom hand into play by whipping it powerfully wide of the fielder at deep square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slammed away! {{BOWLER}} just misses his yorker and ends up dishing out a low full toss. Width on offer too and this is crashed past a diving extra cover. Sweeper cover ain't stopping this\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's so good with those cover-drives. Full delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} waits and lofts the drive over the infield and the timing was great\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot by {{BATSMAN}} to greet {{BOWLER}}. Short of a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out for it and slams it through the gap at cover-point for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the big brother is taking no sighters. He wants a move-on rightaway. Gets a half-volley outside off and {{BATSMAN}} slam-bangs it through covers. Don't bother running..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Pandey tried his best, but the ball still found a way to reach the fence. Width offered outside off, {{BATSMAN}} maintains a low base and drills it in front of square, Pandey runs across from sweeper cover, dives and flicks it in but the ball backspins and touches the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Just a mere push and the ball dribbles away into the fence. {{BOWLER}} comes round the wicket and darts it in full just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} prods forward and middles the straight drive/push. Gets it well wide of mid-off and the quick outfield does the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's spanked! The open stance helps him figure the line and length quickly, uses all his might to smash it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 144.7kph. Damn, violence. {{BATSMAN}} anticipates the back of a length sitter with a lot of width outside off and backs away further to free up his hands as he slices a flashy cut into an empty backward point zone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more conviction in this from {{BATSMAN}}. Short and wide, puts the cut away through cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 119.3kph. And then half way down the pitch. And then down leg. Well .. well. {{BATSMAN}} swivels, adjusts to the lack of bounce. But pulls, very fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he doesn't believe in gentle nudges. Gets a back of a length sitter in the arc and flat bats it with all his might over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, begins with a tripe on leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} accepts it with glee and glances it off his pads, beats short fine leg and races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, very full delivery on the pads, 143km/h, whipped away to the backward square leg fence for four where Chakravarthy puts in the dive but fails to cut it off - a little slow to start, Varun, and the practice pitch didn't help\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lures {{BATSMAN}} with flight and bam! {{BATSMAN}} had enough time to launch it and he absolutely thrashes it over the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full around off. {{BATSMAN}} has nothing to lose, no tailender has! Crunches the drive to the deep extra cover fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and runs! Four of them. Yorkerish delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} squeezes it out and the ball flies away past the dive of the keeper for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is not having a good day with the ball. 10 runs in the first over, already 16 off this. Went down on his knee and swept that flighted delivery over square leg nicely, two boundaries and a six in this over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first convincing shot of the day by {{BATSMAN}}. Thinks he's had enough of {{BOWLER}}! Dances down the wicket and chips the back of a length ball over cover. That'll make him feel much better\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunched! 100 comes up within 10 overs and {{TEAM}} still need to strike over 14 per over. On a length and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands and thumps it on the up past Russell at extra cover. Raced away!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, commits the same mistake again. Fires in a low full toss on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} makes sure to get some bat on that. Tickles it away to the fine leg fence and gets four more, that's the third boundary of the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, flat and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it on the back foot and cuts it behind square on the off-side. Runs away to the fence and that brings up his fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, carved over point! Very full and wide of off, the slower delivery from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} gets low and flashes it with all his might. Third man fielder was straighter and had no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, picked the gap beautifully did {{BATSMAN}}. Short ball at 123.6kph, {{BATSMAN}} picked the length early. Stood tall and pummeled the pull between long-on and deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft. {{BATSMAN}} clears his back leg, perhaps forcing {{BOWLER}} to go straighter - which he does - and then uses all his pace on offer to merely stick his bat out in a paddled sweep, very fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's one of the best shots of the game. A slight move across and offers a straight bat to send it between long-on and deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, expertly done by {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} was getting monotonously predictable with his lines. Full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} walked across his sticks and adjusted it beautifully to lift it over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rare error in the field from Pollard. It would actually be harsh in calling that an error for most fielders, but this is Pollard we're talking about. A mistimed slog from {{BATSMAN}}. However, he still places it to the left of long-on where Pollard sprints and dives across trying to flick the ball in, but fails to get a hand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a short-arm jab. A full toss on off and {{BATSMAN}}'s strong bottom hand does all the talking. Short-arm jabs over Pollard who was ducking for cover. Pressure back on {{BOWLER}}!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh easy. Short, but not short enough. Leg-lined and leg-lined enough. Quick and real quick enough. All {{BATSMAN}} needs is a bat, swivelling, pulling and getting enough of a tickle fine past the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that has been clobbered down the ground. And it will beat Jadeja at the long-on fence. {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker just a bit but that allows {{BATSMAN}} to get under it and power it straight back past the bowler. Jadeja dived full-stretch but his effort went in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh poor ball. A short of length delivery which sits up around the waist and {{BATSMAN}} drags it away past short fine leg. Big decision to get {{BOWLER}} in here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too much risk involved for a single. Oh, wait. Shami at fine leg has made sure that {{BATSMAN}} is rewarded well for the risk, {{BATSMAN}} had taken his front foot long way across to fetch the sweep from off and middle. Was lucky to have connected\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR. Whang! {{BATSMAN}} is making full use of the opportunity. Clears his front leg and smokes a full ball over mid-on. There's Warner at long-on, but he can't get there in time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sliced away over backward point for four. Useful from {{BATSMAN}}. Full and wide delivery, {{BATSMAN}} just about reaches it and then cleverly opens the bat face\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, well KKR bowlers have to go back to the drawing boards after this game and come up with a different plan to {{BATSMAN}} next time. Because the plan to bowl short hasn't worked today, this was off-pace but it didn't matter to {{BATSMAN}} who smacks it to the right of deep mid-wicket, just short of the boundary rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short-and-wide outside off, asking to be punished. {{BATSMAN}} stays back in his crease and cuts it fiercely between short third man and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, hint of width outside off, the length was on the shorter side as well, {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of the bounce and cuts it in front of square on the off-side, beats the fielder at point and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, full on the sticks, nothing really wrong with the ball. But {{BATSMAN}} moved across his line and slogged the ball away to the deep mid region for a four. {{BATSMAN}} is getting some momentum for MI\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this time {{BATSMAN}} splits the gap in the deep perfectly. Thumps it towards cow corner and the ball bounces a couple of times before hitting the ad boards\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, five fifties in a row for {{BATSMAN}} in IPL 2018. He's equaled the record of Sehwag, who was harvesting runs for a living back in 2012. And what a way to get there. Backs away, exposes the stumps and slaps the ball from in front of them audaciously. Connects. Anyone who's near as good as Sehwag -- statiscally! -- will connect\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, good shot to get going. He is out of his crease to negate swing. {{BOWLER}}'s inswinger ends up on his pads and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out. Leans across and flicks it beautifully through backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, what happened there? Pushed through flatter down leg, Mann sinks low and is a bit early into the shot. Gets a top-edge which balloons away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off and running with a boundary, on a good length and just outsi{{BOWLER}} off, {{BATSMAN}} gets across and punches it on the up, beats the laboured dive from Pathan at cover-point and rolls away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that is a top shot. {{BATSMAN}} has been so good today. He has waited for the bad delivery and once he has got one, he's ensured to put it away. This was an overpitch and {{BATSMAN}} smacks it straight back over {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's wound himself up brilliantly there. So brilliantly that he's taken a full ball on the stumps and whipped it over backward square leg, cleverly opening that side of the field by shuffling across early and getting into position. 44 off 42 and I see the unicorn already. Well, almost\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, with the keeper up, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't give the charge. What he does is back away to make room and laces a drive off the stumps through extra-cover. {{BOWLER}} had overpitched there and gets drilled to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, deft! 108.7kph, slower ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} spots it, waits for the ball and opens his bat-face at the last moment to guide it cheekily fine of the man at short third man. Third half-ton in four matches for {{BATSMAN}}! Brilliant\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow! Width offered and {{BATSMAN}} is all over it. There was a deep cover fielder and he beat him to his right. Short as well and {{BATSMAN}} slaps it in front of square, raced away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracked. Rohit isn't happy, asks Rahman to bowl towards the stumps. Fizz overpitches and offers it outside off, minimal effort from {{BATSMAN}}. Shifts his weight forward and caresses the drive that beats extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, streaky but {{BATSMAN}} will take it. On a good length and holding its line outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to drive, the late wobble takes the edge and rolls away through the vacant slip region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful use of the feet from {{BATSMAN}}. He comes down the track and drives it wide of the mid-off fielder for a four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, short and angling into {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-si{{BOWLER}} for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, launched over extra cover! Spoils an otherwise good {{BOWLER}} over. A trifle too full and a bit of width as well, {{BATSMAN}} stood still and lifted it easily over the infield. Clean strike\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ramps the ball over the man at point and that will run away for another four. This is turning out to be a canter for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh Bumrah! {{BOWLER}} will be livid with him. Bowled so well and he's let this go right through him for four. Would have been a single maximum. But {{BOWLER}}'s got to blame himself in the first place for bowling a freebie down the leg-side, Watto sweeps and gets it through short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} tumbles but {{BATSMAN}} connects and gets a boundary. Things only {{BATSMAN}} can do! He gets inside the line of the ball, goes down on his knees and almost paddles it over short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, {{BATSMAN}} is the man in form for {{TEAM}}, length ball on the pads, he gets inside the line and clips it over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, tossed up on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it back over the bowler's head, almost went all the way, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, excellent square cut by {{BATSMAN}}! This was another short ball and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} sees the opportunity there and cuts it very late, past the fielder at backward point and that's four more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is getting better and better for Mumbai. Full toss and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink and gets an outside edge that runs past short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, this is the best of the lot, full and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and drives it back past the non-striker, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short of length at the body, carrying none of the venom that Archer's bouncer did. So {{BATSMAN}} just leans back and helps the pull away comfortably wide of fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a lucky boundary for {{TEAM}}! Was the slider outside off, DK goes for a cut and gets an underedge. Nutmegs the keeper and races away to third man fence. There were two fielders chasing but both were inside the circle, hence there was no chance of stopping this\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, can't stop {{BATSMAN}}, not when he gets short balls. {{BOWLER}} went wide of the crease and sprayed this in to cramp {{BATSMAN}} up for room, but what does {{BATSMAN}} do? Just arches back nonchalantly and ramps the ball cleanly with an open bat face via third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he loves to bat on these kind of tracks, doesn't he? Walks down the wicket and lifts it over the bowler's head for four more. There was a fielder at long-on but this just manages to beat his sprint\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another overcook. This time {{BATSMAN}}'s good enough to ensure he doesn't need a fielding blunder, does it with an on-drive, through a straighter long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, help yourself delivery and {{BATSMAN}} does just that. In an attempt to go short, Bhuvi slips one on the hips, {{BATSMAN}} with one leg up in the air pulls it past the man at short fine. Good start for {{TEAM}}, 10 off the first over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, superb, sensible batting. {{BOWLER}} is all over the shop. Slower delivery down leg, {{BATSMAN}} moves inside the line and helps it along the way past short fine, no chance for Finch or the fielder getting across from deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets away. Krishna bangs it short again outside off, which {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands out to - more in getting out of this non-self-imposed shell - and slaps it powerfully over point. It also helps his cause that it is the tiny Piyush Chawa fielding there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first poor delivery from {{BOWLER}}. Half-volley outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lofts him inside-out over extra cover. Smith running in from long-off gave up a little too early\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now the overcook. {{BOWLER}} tries sneaking in a quiet one, wide, full. Can't. {{BATSMAN}}' up there smart, reaching out and drilling it through extra cover. Here's the move on .. 16 runs in it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 18 runs from the over, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, fired it flatter and on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he goes back and clips it past square leg. The man in the ring was pretty square, gives the chase, but it's in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, byes signalled! The ball kept terribly low as {{BATSMAN}} backed away to thwack it. The ball rolled down to beat the keeper through his legs and run away into the fence. Bumrah giving it a chase comes up with a comical effort - tried to flick it back and en{{BATSMAN}}d up lobbing the ball outsi{{BATSMAN}} the boundary edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful shot! The inswinger from {{BOWLER}} but it's a touch too straight. {{BATSMAN}} flicks it elegantly through in front of square on the leg-side and beats the fielder in the ring. Races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, okay let's try something fancy decides {{BATSMAN}} and he goes for the reverse slap over point. Connects it well and gets it to defeat the dive from sweeper cover to his left\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smashed, length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and thumps it back over the bowler's head, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, too full and missed the yorker by a couple of inches, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss though, whipped it square and past the man at square leg. Boundaries flowing in the final part of the innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off-spin was working alright against {{BATSMAN}} in the previous over for {{BOWLER}} and he gets whacked trying to bowl leg-spin. Short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} absolutely nails it off the back foot wide of cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, second slip would have gobbled that! Genuine outside edge. Just a push away from the body, the ball swerved away off a good length to click the edge and even a dive from first slip (to his left) wasn't good enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, crunched off the middle! Full pitcher in the zone outside off and {{BATSMAN}} just leans into the drive while slotting it in the gap through extra cover, raced away!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes on the back foot in a flash and drives it through cover for another four. Stellar timing from the skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's looking unstoppable, just like the MI openers were earlier in the day. {{BOWLER}} dishes a full length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} stays put and pummels it right over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} takes over the mantle. Short of a length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and pulls it over the leaping backward square fielder. Just about eluded Mathews there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, class apart. It's a short delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} arches back and guides it to perfection over the empty cordon, third man sprints to his left but it's one bounce and over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} responds in style; keeps his head still and smashes the straight drive past the non-striker, that was timed to perfection and no-one's gonna stop that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is relieving some pressure off {{BATSMAN}} and MI. Length ball on his pads, {{BATSMAN}} gleefully puts it away behind square on the on-side. It went in the air - but well wide of Unadkat at short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just over a leaping backward point! Just. Full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} drills off the lower half and manages it get it just over the fielder. Lots of oohs and aahs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, some lovely wristwork from {{BATSMAN}}. Length ball at the stumps, picks it away through midwicket with great force off the wrists\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, delicacy from {{BATSMAN}}! It was a off-cutter which sat up on the pitch, he uses the width and sends it open-bat faced into the vacant third man region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, thumped, no mercy for the RCB bowlers, flighted delivery on off, {{BATSMAN}} gets a big stride forward and drills it wide of mid-wicket, no chance for the fielder in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 142kph, short, wide and {{BATSMAN}} uses all of it in a jumpy upper-cut, behind point, in front of third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, proper {{BATSMAN}}. Early to load onto the front foot and then drills it away through covers. Nothing {{BOWLER}} could have done, except maybe pitching it a bit shorter. But then {{BATSMAN}} might have come up with something else\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, neatly done, {{BOWLER}} took some pace off the ball and angled it across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} waited on it, played it with an open face and ran it past short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, wow. Elegance written all over it. Shot of the day so far. {{BOWLER}} bowls a half-volley on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, presents a full bat face and drives it smoothly down the ground, beats mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ah! Got to feel for the bowler. {{BATSMAN}} was in no control of that shot, still gets a boundary. Quick short ball that keeps following {{BATSMAN}}, who moved leg-side. The ball gets big on him. The batsman, with his eyes closed, goes for the pull. The ball pops up and flies wide of short fine and runs away into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, and thumped! That was a mini helicopter as he smashed a full ball down the ground past long-off for a four. The ball was full, {{BATSMAN}} just gave himself a little room and smashed it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 124.3kph, massive slip down leg. And {{BATSMAN}} couldn't have asked for it easier, going through his full-blooded pick-up-and-swipe shot behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short-ish and wide, {{BATSMAN}} slashes and slashes hard, as that blazes away in front of third man for four. The spin on that shows you how hard he sliced that...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, welcome to Delhi says {{BATSMAN}}. Shortish and wi{{BOWLER}} outsi{{BOWLER}} off, {{BATSMAN}} treks back and fiercely cuts it behind square on the off-si{{BOWLER}}. Gets it well out of the reach of backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, low full toss and sliding down, helped past backward square leg. Easy delivery to get and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} exploits the field. Too short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} quickly shifts his weight back and punches it past Bhajji at cover, who gaves a desperate chase but the ball wins the race\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short and wide, and pumped away with an uppish cut shot behind square on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely played by {{BATSMAN}}, width on offer from {{BOWLER}}. He leans into the shot, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and steers it behind square on the on-side, gets it past backward point and into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that four evens out the over. Once more {{BOWLER}} goes for the fuller length and with mid-off inside the ring he was taking a risk, {{BATSMAN}} hammers the drive straight of mid-off and collects the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, the reverse sweep in full flow from {{BATSMAN}}, gets down low and gets it into the gap behind square on the off-side. It was picked up from the middle-stump line as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, down the leg-side and {{BATSMAN}} clips it fine of fine leg for a boundary. Nice way to get off the mark!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh lovely. He's already showing some excellent touch out there. 102kph delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} stays back to it and then dabs it out of the keeper's gloves. So so late and really really fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another similar open-chested reverse-hack over short third man but unfortunately, it's not enough for {{TEAM}}. Rajasthan Royals win by 15 runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, {{BATSMAN}} is looking attractive, back of a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stays back, gets on top of the bounce and punches it into the gap past cover, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor bowling and {{BATSMAN}} pounces on it. Too straight in line from round the wicket and all that the batsman has to do it get it over short fine leg. Does so with a lofted stroke after a walk across the sticks\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, just a little push but the sound it made was a proof of superb timing. {{BATSMAN}} got on the front foot and then beat the man at cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fuller and outside off, a handsome square drive to get off the mark from {{BATSMAN}}, he presses forward and creams it with an open bat face square of the wicket, giving sweeper no chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery and {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark. Slips it onto the legs, just needed a tickle and {{BATSMAN}} got plenty of wood on that, the ball raced away to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, third boundary of the over. And {{TEAM}} are off to a flyer. There was room on this delivery, {{BATSMAN}} stays put in the crease and cuts it past backward point for a boundary. Excellent placement!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is playing the perfect foil to Gayle. Warner already worried. Full on middle and leg, whipped through mid-wicket and mid-on. Hit uppishly but placed it expertly in the gap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 19 runs off the 19th over. A full toss to end the over as {{BATSMAN}} flicks it over square leg. The fielder was inside the ring, hence Polly will get four more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, drifting into the pads, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles a fraction before helping it to the fine leg fence. Easy!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's unwittingly sliced that over short third man. A knuckle ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands at it, the bat-face opens on impact and the ball beautifully lobs over the infield. A bit of a helicopter from {{BATSMAN}} too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, mowed from outside off and beats long-on to his right. Knelt down and hit it, not with great timing but good enough to get it in the gap and four more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged away! If there was a slip, this could have been a catch. An easy one. {{BATSMAN}} went back in his crease to cut it but got an outside edge, through the empty slip cordon to find the third man boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}}. Short ball down the leg side and {{BATSMAN}} glances it past the fielder at short fine leg, off to a rocket start\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four, handy runs for {{BATSMAN}}, back of a length and rising onto the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} didn't get on top of the bounce, was looking to cut, gets a thick edge that runs away past the lone slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, tossed up just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends down low, gets on top of the bounce, rolls his wrists over and sweeps it in front of square on the on-side. de Grandhomme has no chance - getting across to his right from deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cute from {{BATSMAN}}. On a length and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} opens the face of the bat and runs it down, beats third man. Raced away. {{BOWLER}} isn't happy at all\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged and four. {{BATSMAN}} didn't see a short ball coming ball. Got big on the batsman and {{BATSMAN}} persisted with the pull shot. The top edge flies over Dhoni's head for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hit straight back at {{BOWLER}} and he was late to get his hand up. Once more the off-cutter which almost fooled {{BATSMAN}}, who shimmied down and checked his drive, middled it alright to beat the mid-off fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air and just over. Expensive start for {{BOWLER}}, 14 off the first over. Full and curling away outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} is in no control of the drive as he hits it uppishly and manages to get it over the leaping cover-point fiel{{BATSMAN}}r\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is even better, length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track, makes room as he did so and cracks it square on the off-side, hit on the up and in the gap past point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 112kph slower ball, but you can't offer width with both backward point and third man inside the ring. {{BATSMAN}} delays the late cut and guides it nicely between the two fielders\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off and running. {{BOWLER}} loses his radar and sprays it on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} will not miss out on those. Just nonchalantly whips it past square leg. The ball raced away to the fence at MACH 3\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, no wonder - the Daredevils are backing him despite poor form. This is a top shot, 'exquisite - a proper cricket shot', gushes KP on air. Nothing wrong with the ball, on a good length and just outside off, Karun leans forward, drives it on the up and splits the gap past cover-point, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50-run stand up. Goes for the yorker but he's bowled a nice little full toss here -- something that {{BATSMAN}} uses to hit his first boundary. Scythed round the corner, that full toss\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, whackkkkkkkkkk! {{BATSMAN}} has had enough of proding around. Charges down the track and makes room before blasting this wide of the man at mid-off. Races away to the fence in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clever hit, short delivery rising steeply, {{BATSMAN}} stays leg side of the ball and guides it over Karthik for a much needed boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, errs off the final ball - a flat one on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to pounce on it, shapes up to sweep, and nails it to the backward square leg fence for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, has been the {{BATSMAN}} and Narine show so far! Short in length and width on offer, the batsman reaches out and carves it past the fielder at square third man, four more for the right hander\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is riding his luck! This was a length delivery snaking away, he tried to punch it on the up and got a thick outside edge. Past the man at second slip and into the third man fence. As a result of this, Ashwin has decided to bring in the third slip too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air and over the fielder. {{BOWLER}} pitches it up and {{BATSMAN}} does not need a second invitation, drives in the air and over Mishra at mid-off. Even a full length jump from Mishy wasn't enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, rank long hop to start {{BOWLER}}'s spell, {{BATSMAN}} picked the bones out of the pull shot, rocks back and nails it wide of the mid-wicket fielder. No need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, heaved over mid-wicket! Looked ungainly from {{BATSMAN}} but he's managed to clear the infield with ease. Was a length ball, picked from outside off and lobbed with a heave across the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no... he doesn't! How often have we seen the last delivery of the over to be the spoiler! Darts it on leg and {{BATSMAN}} gets down on his knee to paddle it away and a chase by the fielder is not enough to stop this as the ball races away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a boundary but this was hardly middled by {{BATSMAN}}. The bowler actually won a mini battle there, tried the outswinger, but that didn't swing much, the angle away troubled {{BATSMAN}}, who wanted to smash this over long-off, the ball hits the outside half of the bat and flies over cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes pulling. And goes into the gap. Doesn't get enough meat, and thank heavens for that. It goes a lot finer, beating square leg in the ring. It's 10 off the final over. And you thought this was over, twice\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pounces on the width and flashes it up and over backward point. Poor delivery. {{BATSMAN}} up and running with a nice couple of boundaries\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a ground version of the helicopter. Not only does he share the same state, he shares the same shots too with the big man. The slower yorker, takes an eternity to dip down. Enough for the adjustment and a chopper to be unleashed. Talk about the precision in the placement too. Surgical in bisecting the two men at the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has killed the game. Or should I say {{BOWLER}}? Why dart the ball when it's turning! {{BATSMAN}} slogs and hits it well enough and wide of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} bowls a short ball, no venom. And {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it. Swivel-pulls it fiercely in front of square leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} keeps getting those boundaries! {{TEAM}} need a few more of these. Was a loopy legbreak down the leg side and the left hander sweeps it past the fielder at short fine leg, getting a move on. Slowly but surely\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four more! {{BOWLER}} isn't learning here. He is continuously offfering width outside off. {{BATSMAN}} spots it and pummels it in front of square on the off-side. No chance for Dhawan in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 4 runs, oh dear, Jadeja misses the stumps and it's gone for four overthrows. A direct-hit would have seen {{BATSMAN}} walk back though. It looked very interesting when he chose the striker's end, despite Uthappa being halfway down the pitch. Should have been a dot ball, but it's four runs now. {{BATSMAN}} tapped this to point and thought about a run, took a couple of steps out of the crease, his partner was charging towards the other end, but {{BATSMAN}} sent him back. All well in the end for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, starts the over with a short one and has been dispatched away past point for a four. {{BATSMAN}} played it late and got it fine enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}}'s special. Classic on-drive. {{BOWLER}} feeds a half-volley on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} just shifted his weight forward, presented a full face of the bat and drove it neatly past mid-on. No need to run for those as it races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot! Tad fuller around off, {{BATSMAN}} brings his bat down in a sweet flow and crunches his drive past the fielder at cover. There was a fielder in the deep to hunt it down but the timing was just about right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, first ball has disappeared to the fence. He dragged the length back and {{BATSMAN}} waited for it on the backfoot, muscles the pull in front of square on the leg-side - right between deep mid-wicket and long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short third didn't even move. Nor did backward point. Short and wide outside off, cut right into the gap between the two\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's edged and four. {{BATSMAN}} needs a little bit of luck to change his fortune. He drives down the wrong line, it clipped his outside edge and it went wide of first slip for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 17 off the over and that releases the pressure that Mishra and Lamichhane built up. Full and on the pads, easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}, who flicks it nonchalantly past the diving short fine leg fielder. It was just the matter of putting it in the gap and {{BATSMAN}} did it to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is shaking his head, but there is very little he can do about that. The yorker just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waited and went low, opened the bat face and dug it to the right of short third man, who dived just as an afterthought\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back sloppy efforts. A tossed up delivery outside off and {{BATSMAN}} chips it to deep cover where Boult makes a mess of it. Was charging in to avoid the batsmen from taking the second, and ends up gifting them a boundary. Rohit Sharma wouldn't be a happy skipper with those two boundaries..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} has come out with a positive intent and that is paying dividends. Finds the gap beautifully on his cover drive. No need to run for shots like that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, jumps away, gives himself room and punches against the spin. That's not the fun part. The fun starts when this seeming push ends up splitting mid-off and extra cover. Wow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he is not going to budge, this man who beats jetlags. Clears the front leg and hits it flat over mid-off, one bounce and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, stands deep inside his crease and exerts all his power on the punchy-drive, gets it past a diving mid-off to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh well well. Where is sweeper cover? The fielder was very square in his position, and {{BATSMAN}} made some room to slap the ball away from off-stump. Brilliant batting. But was that the plan or did the fielder stand out of place. {{BOWLER}} shakes his head as he walks back\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, blame {{BATSMAN}} for stealing AB's century. A fullish length and he throws every ounce of his muscle to cart it straight down. Roy chases, dives, and has probably cut himself on the rope. Yeah, none of it could stop the boundary though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's waited on this slower ball, and then just chipped it back over {{BOWLER}}'s head. Superb from {{BATSMAN}}, first to watch it like a hawk and then to have the composure\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh you are unreal man! This fella has bowled a pretty decent leggie and you've whipped it with your rubber wrists from the within the stumps, finding the cow corner fence. Not many would have split deep mid-wicket and long-on because it's hard to time that ball so well with such a shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 130.7kph, just too full. {{BATSMAN}}'s already deep in his crease, incubating half vollies and then carving them inside-out over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this is the best of the lot. Googly around leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it against the spin to deep mid-wicket. He played it all along the ground and still managed to beat the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another boundary to finish the over. {{BATSMAN}} is off to a flyer here. It was on a short of length and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} powers the pull shot wide of mid-on, Nabi puts in a valiant effort there by chasing it down. He puts in a dive too but his foot was touching the ropes when ball was in his contact and that will be signalled as a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}! Gets plenty of width outside off and {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink to smash the boundary ropes wide of the fielder at square third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, clubbed, tossed up well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends down low, gets close to the ball and then swipes it wide of mid-wicket, bisected the gap between the two fielders in the deep perfectly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, edged but doesn't carry and beats first slip! {{BOWLER}} is getting some bite off the pitch, got this to spin away sharply but {{BATSMAN}} did well to play with soft hands. Hence, the edge fell short of Watto and beat him as well to the fence. Bhajji gave chase but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} flashes and flashes hard, nearly picked out the fielder at short third man but it's just out of reach of Tahir. It was short and plenty of width for the taking, {{BATSMAN}} obliged and ended up outside-edging it. Luckily, gets away as it just about beats Tahir's dive to his left and runs away to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Kuldeep is having a forgettable outing. Slower short ball, {{BATSMAN}} pivots back and pulls it uppishly. Lands in front of Kuldeep at deep square leg, who perhaps gets caught in two-minds. Doesn't attempt a catch and neither does he gets his body in the line. It sprang up and loops over his head to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the airrrr, in the gap and a poor effort from Dan Christian meant the ball escaped for four. He had to dive, thought about it, but took a long while to react. {{BOWLER}} bowls full and outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} lofts the drive inside-out, could have been cut off by the man running from long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, no problems with the timing there. Picks the slower delivery outside off and then laces the cover-drive on the rise, sheer timing and leaves sweeper cover as a spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, smart from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} generally bowls it quicker through the air, so {{BATSMAN}} smartly stoops across on the back knee, uses the pace and paddles it round the corner. His placement is spot on, splitting the dives from short fine and long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} goes downtown! {{BOWLER}} slightly overpitches and the Karnataka lad takes full toll of it. Right in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} thumps it over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short delivery on middle and leg, that is easy pickings for a South African, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and pulls it towards long leg. Bounced just before the ad cushions\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, game, set and match - {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} finishes things off in style. Slanting on middle and leg, KW gets across and whips it over square leg to take {{TEAM}} into the Playoffs. No-one in the deep and it'll be a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, one shot ball too many from {{BOWLER}}! This one lacked venom! It was around hip-height, {{BATSMAN}} gets in good position and he powers it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker and {{BATSMAN}} thrashes it away. He gets underneath the ball and smashes it towards the cow corner fence, one bounce and into the fence. Good start to the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely batting. Low full toss outside off, not far from the yorker, {{BATSMAN}} is deep in the crease, opens the bat face and drives through extra cover. No chance for the sweeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sheer class! {{BATSMAN}} had some runs in the last game and hence, is in a good space mentally. Gets a full ball that's not all that wide but {{BATSMAN}} got a nice stride forward and eased the square drive through point. The timing was fab\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ah! Streaky, {{BATSMAN}} won't mind though. Seam-up {{BOWLER}}livery on a short of length, probably kept a tad low. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to work it through the on-si{{BOWLER}} and gets an insi{{BOWLER}} edge that elu{{BOWLER}}s the leg pole and dribbles away into the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ends the over well. Made room while dancing down, the width on offer made him free his arms and send the ball sailing over the extra cover fielder. Rocketed away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh dear, is Miller okay? That burst through his hands and hit him on the head. Luckily, it looks like just a glancing blow. The good length ball was hit ferociously by {{BATSMAN}} and it flew towards extra-cover. Would have taken some catching but Miller would normally back himself\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, poor delivery to follow. Very short, {{BATSMAN}} had all the time to rock back and pull. Chooses his area and gets it wide of CdG at deep square. Should've dived but didn't\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, FOUR, hmmm, slips into the thighs, and the thighs are good enough to nudge them away fine, certainly helps his cause when fine leg's inside the ring\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, follows it up with another loosener down leg, {{BATSMAN}} makes him pay again. Tried the in-angler, overcompensates and {{BATSMAN}} gets across to tickle it very fine. Good over for {{TEAM}}, all the pressure created has been released now off the final two balls\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, quickly on a knee, and to his credit doesn't try getting under the already-full length. Instead settles to sweep, and does it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, maiden fifty for {{BATSMAN}} in the IPL. Brilliant innings from the Englishman. He is giving a taste of IPL cricket to the young man now. It was on the stumps and {{BATSMAN}} paddles it fine of fine leg for a boundary. Sweet timing!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, risky shot and he gets a boundary! Expects the googly and jumps deep inside the crease, plays the cut at the last instant and the edge flies wide of Warner at slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 50 comes up for {{TEAM}} with this boundary. They are off to a great start here. {{BOWLER}} misses his mark and hurls a delivery just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went hard at that and skewed it over extra cover. Didn't come off the middle as the bat face turned in his hands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets as low as he can, picks the flighted delivery from outside off and swipes it over square leg for his first boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, plants his back foot at least a couple of feet outside off, rocks back, and mows the pull through square leg. The footwork had {{BATSMAN}} written all over it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, that's a shot of a batsman, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track, gets close to the ball and drills it through extra-cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, {{BOWLER}} is running out of ideas, back of a length and well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets on top of the bounce and clatters it over cover-point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a fielding blip from Buttler and that's a boundary. Yuvi knew what was coming with the field set, stayed on the back foot and unveiled the cut with a glitter of left-hander's elegance. Jos runs to his right from cover and dives, the ball slids through his fingers to add agony to a grumpy-looking Rohit Sharma\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, misses the length by a mere few inches, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and slams this straight down the ground for four! Incredible!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautifully timed! {{BOWLER}} searches for swing and in the process, overcooks this outside off. Stroked sweetly down the ground and beats the diving mid-off fielder with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, backs away and slashes the drive between cover and point. The ball races away into the fence. The batsman manufactured his own room\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark first ball. But with a boundary. Width outside off, crashed wide of cover-point and on this outfield, no-one is stopping that. Nice shot as he freed his arms\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Pat {{BATSMAN}} would have grown up playing such shots and the length was ideal. Short at 138ks and right in the slot for him, powers the pull and gets it in the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for {{BATSMAN}} - this was a streaky one though, short of a length and on off, he was hopping across on the pull, gets an inside edge onto the thigh-pad and it rolls away to the third man ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is a monster when he gets going that is. Stands on the crease and butchers this slowish off-cutter that sits up, beats extra cover with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, adding salt into the wounds for the Royals. {{BOWLER}} begins with a tripe delivery down leg. Easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}, gets across and whacks it over square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a tad short and angling into the body, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and guides the pull to backward square leg where Sarfraz misfields and lets it through for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, enough bat on it to clear the man at short fine. {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knees on that delivery on the stumps and slog sweeps it over short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, gets cheeky. Picks up the floaty leggie outside off, knows there's nobody at third man. And reverses. Nailing it past slip\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries once again from {{BATSMAN}}, comes down the track, covered for the spin and lifts it over the head of mid-on, a couple of bounces and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, intent from the skipper! Wastes no time. Gets a half-volley on the pads and DK flicks it with nonchalance. The timing was such that the fielder had deep mid-wicket could nothing else than admire the shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} throws it up once more and this time {{BATSMAN}} threads the crowded off-side field. Overpitched and {{BATSMAN}} went full-throttle on the drive, raced to the sweeper fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} concedes his first boundary of the match. {{BATSMAN}} shuffles and gets low to slog-sweep. Gets a top edge against this leg-stump line ball. Flies over the keeper and runs away very fine to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, pace is one thing you can't bowl on this surface. 143.2kph and {{BATSMAN}} even advanced to make his own speed, makes just enough room to thump it over extra cover, Miller tried his best but the timing was good enough to beat him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} knew that a slower ball was coming, backed away nicely to free the arms and slapped it hard over extra-cover for four. Easy pickings those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, oh, {{BOWLER}} will have to make his peace will only a moral victory. Nails the yorker, and it's quickly ripping through {{BATSMAN}}'s legs. Too good for Buttler behind as well ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, FOUR, what happened there? {{BATSMAN}} was loose with his shot. Drives away from the body and the ball spun a mile to beat the outside edge. Keeper too fails to glove that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now the overcorrection from {{BOWLER}}, feeds a tasty half-volley. {{BATSMAN}} stayed leg-side of the ball, puts his bottom hand to good effect once again to blast it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, delicately cut late. Cute. {{BOWLER}} gives it some flight, but then gets it to dip short and wide allowing Sharma a rock behind and a carve between point and short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 18 runs off the over! Just what the doctor ordered for Punjab. This was full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} threw his bat at it and got an outside edge that eluded Dhoni and found the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, not where he exactly intended but he will earn a boundary. {{BATSMAN}} gets off the mark with a boundary. {{BOWLER}} bangs it short, {{BATSMAN}} was committed to the pull, was hustled by pace, manages to get it off the higher part of his bat and skews it over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nice way to get off the mark. Sliding in on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to get low and sweep it fine. The ball has enough legs to dribble away past the boundary rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, length ball, no room, {{BATSMAN}} opens his arms and carves it away past point. The man at sweeper cover dived to make the tackle but in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, he's just toyed with the bowler. The fielder was moved squarer after the first boundary but this time {{BATSMAN}} goes straighter with his whip, another one bounce four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, lovely, lovely shot! Pitched up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drives on the up and gets it in the gap between cover and extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, 14 off the opening over! {{BOWLER}} continues to have a terrible IPL. A wide half-volley outside off and {{BATSMAN}} flays it over backward point. Third boundary for {{BATSMAN}}!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, horrible umpiring. Really poor. How is that runs? {{BATSMAN}} is beaten all ends up by one that squares him up, pitched on middle, turned past the bat and hit the back leg, raced away past DK. {{BOWLER}} went for a slight appeal and then kept quiet. Llong the ump who has given it as runs. Not even close to the bat. KKR should've reviewed that, but since it was given as runs, they didn't go for it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BOWLER}} is guilty of providing width on this one, {{BATSMAN}} delays his bat swing and cuts it wide of backward point for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's a poor ball, spoils the over for {{BOWLER}}. Down the leg-side, the cutter gone wrong. {{BATSMAN}} helps the pull past the man in the ring at short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, streaky but he won't mind. {{BOWLER}} sees the batsman back away and hurls it full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat and gets a thickish outside edge that flies through the vacant slip region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's how you deal with the slower balls. A short of length delivery from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} dances down the track and smashes it over Raina's head. One bounce and into the long-on fence. All power!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's the width and there's the first boundary for {{BATSMAN}}. No feet movement at all from the spinner, stands his ground and slashes it off the outer half to third man, the fielder was inside the ring and it turned out to be a safe shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short, wide and four, width on offer and {{BATSMAN}} is all over it like a rash - gets on top of the bounce and clatters it square past backward point for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's an excellent shot by {{BATSMAN}}. Was a yorker outside off and the South African squeezes it past the man at short third man. Gayle had no chance to even react as the ball raced past him and rushed into the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, two fours in a row for {{BATSMAN}}. Sliding down leg as Rahman corrects his line. {{BATSMAN}} drags the sweep, more of the bottom. But it beats short fine leg and races away to the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, Rajasthan having a torrid time in the field. Aaron now concedes a boundary. Fraction short and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} backs cuts it to third man and Aaron lets it escape right through his legs. That is now 10 runs given away for free\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, slog-swept! Shabby fielding effort from Woakes at deep mid-wicket. Dives to his left, but doesn't stretch enough to flick the ball back\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, nicely done! Good length, seam-up {{BATSMAN}}livery, marginally outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} opens his bat-face at the last moment and runs it very fine to the third man fence. Used the bowler's pace to good effect\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, genius stuff from {{BATSMAN}}! Was giving the charge and then got a slower ball in response, quite shorter too but the {{TEAM}} skipper adjusted with an elegant back foot punch through backward point. Style, grace and placement all ticked\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, hammers it down the ground. Brute power from {{BATSMAN}}, who was nowhere near the pitch of it after stepping out. But the slowness of the surface allowed him to adjust before he brought the sledgehammer down and smashed it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now a full toss on the pads, whipped away over backward square leg. He's missed his lengths with the first two balls, and at his pace, he will disappear - as he has\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, short ball down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and powers the pull in the gap behind square on the leg-side, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the Mumbai captain is up for it tonight. He's taking control of this chase now. Short of length ball, only chest high, and {{BATSMAN}} dismisses it with an authoritative pull backward of square. Huge cheers. It's a split crowd here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, more width. {{BATSMAN}}'s as good as most with flat-bats. This time he's carving them behind point. Absolute crunch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a leaping Ngidi .. and if something evades him, it's never a catch good enough to be called a drop. {{BATSMAN}} half-dabs, off the outer half and short third man can only try\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, sweeps it fine and sweeps it well to get it away for a four. That was well down leg and {{BATSMAN}} helped himself to a boundary by placing it to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, delicate! Slower back of a length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} walked across his stumps to get inside the line and then glances it off the hips past the short fine fielder, just a roll of the wrists to pocket a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, PP continues on his merry ways\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} greets {{BOWLER}} to the attack with a boundary. Not the ideal start as he drops it short, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back quickly and swats it in front of square on the leg-side. Threads the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, yorker followed by a slow short of length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for that, he stayed on the back foot and pulled it in front of square, bisected deep mid-wicket and long-on to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's not the area to be bowling, certainly not to Sunil {{BATSMAN}}. He loves width and with the length full it only makes matters easy for him, pumps this over extra cover with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fabulous shot! It was the wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} picked it, he went down on his knee and swept it with the spin backward of square, giving no chance for the fielder in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the loss of radar. Five consecutive half-centuries for {{BATSMAN}} against Punjab. Has to be the most difficult one. Certainly the slowest. Gets there with a tuck off his hips in ensuring that it is fine enough for fine leg to cut it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a grunt on that by {{BOWLER}}, but it is no good! Good length but loads of width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands at it and laces it to the sweeper cover boundary for four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, beautiful shot. With mid-off up insi{{BOWLER}} the circle, {{BOWLER}} pitches it up outsi{{BOWLER}} off. {{BATSMAN}} spots it and caresses the drive. It was uppish, but in the gap. 12 runs off the tenth over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} is playing with a lot of freedom today. Floater just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} opens his stance and lofts it inside-out over extra cover. High percentage shot against spin.. brilliant!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, now what do I call that.. Will be an outside edge to the naive but this has been cleverly played late and just wide of the keeper. Bat face opens at the last minute and {{BOWLER}}'s grounded. Sort of. We'll see\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the airrr and if Pollard can't get there with that trampoline jump of his, nobody can. Gee these batsmen have no mercy, not even for Jas {{BOWLER}}! Well, this was a freebie ball though, full and in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} muscles it hard over mid-off and looks like Pollard has hurt himself coming down hard on the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, {{BATSMAN}} does not want to be left out. He hangs back to this wrong 'un and since the ball is turning it away, it offers him the room to slap it past the diving extra cover fielder. Long-off can only pick the ball up from the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, starts with a full toss on leg. Easy-peasy for {{BATSMAN}}. He clips it in front of square on the on-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, ruins it further. Hangs back patiently on the back foot toying around with the bowler's mind in waiting for the short-slower combo to get to him. When he does, he heaves and posts it bisecting the two men converging at cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, this man is great with his inside-out lofted drives over the cover region. Can't really say that this is a bad ball from the bowler. Middle and leg line on a good length, {{BATSMAN}} moved leg-side and played that easily over extra-cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, it's all one-handed from KL and he's getting the runs as well, flighted delivery outside off, he bent down low, used the bottom hand and then swept it over square leg for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, goes the other way round! Changes grips and goes for the reverse hit, ends up getting a top-edge that flies over short third man. Four more for the left hander\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's the strong bottom hand grip on this punch from {{BATSMAN}}, stayed deep in the crease, converted this yorker into a full ball and crashes it to deep cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, a short and wide ball with third man inside the ring? {{BATSMAN}} is not going to miss out on those as he plays an upper cut and finds the fence at square third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, another blemish and it's a boundary. {{TEAM}} and {{BATSMAN}} will not mind this. Very full from Kumar, {{BATSMAN}} clubs it down the ground. Hooda misjudges it and charges in way too early, doesn't get his body behind the line of the ball and lets it through to the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's why you can't not like him. {{BOWLER}} strategy is pretty obvious: Bowl it slow and angle it across, because there's third man and backward point waiting to cut the runs off. And {{BATSMAN}} here has found the tiniest of gaps between the fielders. Beautifully done, opening the bat face just enough to cleave the fielders\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, the boundaries keep coming as the bowlers keep erring in line. Full ball on the pads, fine leg is inside the ring, so {{BATSMAN}} effortlessly whips it over him and into the fence. {{TEAM}} off to a flying start\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, back-to-back fours! A quick non-turner wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} stays back in the crease and scythes it hard and wide of backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, cracking shot, {{BATSMAN}} is playing a handy cameo here, length ball and he drilled it back over the bowler's head - mid-off was inside the ring and the man at long-on couldn't get across in time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, fetches it from outside off and has swept it past square leg for a four. More of a hacked sweep to get it past the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, spanked! Murdered! Four.. That was a little shimmy and a powerful blade smacking it down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, there's four more. Back of a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}}'s aware that third man is in and he uses the pace to dab it past the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, that's been so brilliantly placed. Short of length but it's just outside off, so escapes the ignominy of being a short-wide ball and adds to the genius of {{BATSMAN}}, who's nicely used his hands to glide it right between short third man and backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, four to finish the over. He has placed it brilliantly. It was short and was on the body, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and pulls it wide of short fine for a boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, in the air, over the 30-yard circle and goes for a boundary. Angled across on a fuller length and {{BATSMAN}} is bending forward to hammer the drive. Slices over the cover region off the outside half and the quick outfield does the rest. Not a pacy ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, oh the swagger. It's supposedly his first ball in the IPL and he starts off in all glory. A juicy pitch up, he gets under, flows through the line and lofts it over mid-off. Well over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, overpitched, and that's flying over {{BATSMAN}}'s scalp. Scooped away straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, FOUR, off-cutter from {{BOWLER}}, but it's right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} to hammer it over mid-off\n"

            "BATS\n",
            "There you have it, the only thing holding back the pace of this batsmen's bowling is the quickness of the batsman's delivery. This is not bad at all, for this sort of length, a short leg delivery on the outside. A well ball, a fine delivery from the forward fielder at the top of the order for the third over. On the opening toss, it gets the outside edge and a long cover runs down off, into the fence. It's a bit of a mid-off, and this was the way he managed to get the pull, his length and effort to get over the ball is fantastic, and is a great all-round delivery. But there was no real time to set it, he was on full height, straight ahead from the bowler, and got in a crease. So wide that the fielder couldn't get the pace from his back leg and he put it in on the off-side in front of the fielder. He got a hold on that and the delivery went round. There's the length and width inside of the cover, which was too short, but it was enough to get the ball to the fence. The third over is another delivery from him for the four-run, and he got his body into the space of the four runs and put it into the gap. He had no time to cover up the gap. So well done to him - this was an excellent drive, a short drive and a wonderful delivery was all about to come from the captain. And again for this to have been a boundary-drive delivery, he has to be a little bit nervous. It was an off-side delivery with a quick hand and no chance of getting his leg open. But there is a line behind that, a long way forward between this ball and a bouncer outside that he is lucky to have, and it has to end there.\n",
            "WATER\n",
            "This match was just over three years ago, and these days that's something of a mantra for many players. These days, when the power is low and the pace is wide, it's rare to see a ball outside on which the field is going to change hands. The boundary-drive delivery from the bowler was a bit early on, and wasn't quite as clean as a few years back - this is an opening and his footwork is in perfect fine form. But this one is not going to be short and he takes a short flick on the mark\n",
            "WINGSMAN\n",
            "So when's this one going to be scored, this one? He took it from back-off, got away with it and played it fine. The fielder had the intent and looked deep for a touch, and he couldn't see it coming as he had a chance. The outside leg was wide and short for a delivery outside off, and the fielder had his eyes on the outside edge of the ground. But the ball wasn't going into the cover and his stroke was too long\n",
            "THE BATSMAN GETS PUNCHED\n",
            "Gosh, how did he react? He's done this kind of thing before this, in this sort of situation. So with such power, and in such a way that is why he is a perfect fielder to do this. Not only is it a power fielder like him in all his cricket, it is also a man of speed - and that means his delivery at short outside off is off edge, too. A good delivery and a perfectly placed shot from his hand that beat a fielder's line through off cover, the inside delivery went fine through mid-on, and through the gap it was cut in half and the fielder was left in mid-on\n",

            "TECHNICAL FIELD GRAB\n",
            "This is where the gap of four runs gets much needed help. With a well rounded shot from a distance, a shot that was very much at the very far end to open in front of the fielder, there was a lot to do, the ball was cut short from the left edge of cover and his arm was in the gap to pull it out, it flew wide and over the fielder's cover. It was a fine, fine hit that had a good spin and that's exactly what he did.\n",
