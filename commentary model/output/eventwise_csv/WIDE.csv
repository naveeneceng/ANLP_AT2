89,7898444,MI 1st Inns,20.0,"Dinda to Hardik Pandya, wide, out Southee Run Out!! Where was Southee going? He might have thought that it was the last ball of the innings, but Pandya was sure that it was a wide and there would be an extra delivery. Dinda fires it outside off, Pandya can't reach it and Southee was at the other end by the time Pandya could react. Dhoni lobbed it to Dinda, who took care of the rest. The third umpire checks if the batsmen had crossed, Pandya got his back foot in before Southee could reach the crease. It's touch and go, but Pandya will cling on to the strike.
