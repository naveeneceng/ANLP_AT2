4281444,RCB 1st Inns,0.5,"Nehra to Mandeep, FOUR, first boundary for Mandeep and RCB. Full and on the pads, needed to be put away and Mandeep did just that, picked it up and dispatched it over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and into the fence",Nehra to Mandeep,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,1.0,"Nehra to Mandeep, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries to end the first over. Again, Nehra is a tad short in his length, Mandeep had the width to cut and he didn't try to hit it hard, just placed it behind point and Bhuvi at third man gave up the chase pretty quickly",Nehra to Mandeep,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,10.0,"Henriques to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, hit straight back at Henriques and he was late to get his hand up. Once more the off-cutter which almost fooled Jadhav, who shimmied down and checked his drive, middled it alright to beat the mid-off fielder",Henriques to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,10.4,"Nehra to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, another full toss, it's Jadhav this time and he picks his spot into the deep mid-wicket fence. Not great bowling from Nehra. He's missing the yorker by quite a bit",Nehra to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,10.5,"Nehra to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, four more. Jadhav starting to really find his timing now and he's looking dangerous. This is smart batting rather than just throwing his bat at everything. He knows that fine leg is up and so he waits for the back of a length delivery to come to him before pulling it over the fielder. Nehra under pressure",Nehra to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,12.4,"Rashid Khan to Head, FOUR, goes down and smashes the full toss over the deep mid-wicket ropes. Some nerves maybe from the Afghanistan leggie and Head pounced all over them with a mighty slog-sweep",Rashid Khan to Head,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,15.5,"Cutting to Watson, FOUR, plants his foot down and absolutely drills the ball wide of a diving extra-cover. Overpitched from Cutting, Watson blasts him away",Cutting to Watson,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,2.2,"Nehra to Gayle, FOUR, Nehra goes back to the shorter length, Gayle seems a tad comfortable with that, hops on one leg and uses Nehra's pace to guide it past the diving short fine leg fielder",Nehra to Gayle,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,2.4,"Nehra to Mandeep, FOUR, might have been the slower one and Mandeep picked the bones out of that one. He cleared his front leg to give him more options and then slots the loft over mid-on, one bounce and over the rope",Nehra to Mandeep,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,4.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Mandeep, FOUR, Mandeep is playing the perfect foil to Gayle. Warner already worried. Full on middle and leg, whipped through mid-wicket and mid-on. Hit uppishly but placed it expertly in the gap",Bhuvneshwar to Mandeep,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,5.0,"Cutting to Gayle, FOUR, not convincing, but Gayle will take that. A very good over from Cutting. Just misses the length this ball, goes full and that allows Gayle to get underneath and hoick it over mid-wicket. Not off the middle but enough to clear the fielder",Cutting to Gayle,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,5.2,"Rashid Khan to Mandeep, FOUR, Rashid throws it up once more and this time Mandeep threads the crowded off-side field. Overpitched and Mandeep went full-throttle on the drive, raced to the sweeper fence",Rashid Khan to Mandeep,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,7.1,"Rashid Khan to Head, FOUR, lots of flighted and lands as a half volley, Head gets a good stride forward and drives it past Henriques at extra cover, the timing was superb as long-off had no chance of cutting that off",Rashid Khan to Head,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,8.0,"Rashid Khan to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, ordinary delivery from Rashid and Jadhav is all over it. The young man is shaking his head while taking his cap from the umpire. Half tracker which sat up nicely for Jadhav, who pulls it between deep mid-wicket and long-on",Rashid Khan to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,9.1,"Henriques to Head, FOUR, Head does the most of the full length delivery, stays deep in the crease and opens himself up to free his arms, smashes it straight down the ground and even a quick Warner could not reach that from long-on",Henriques to Head,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,0.3,"Tymal Mills to Warner, FOUR, lovely shot, sublime timing on that one from Warner, it wasn't anything more than a back-foot punch. This was a back of a length delivery outside off, he got on top of the bounce and placed it in the gap past point",Tymal Mills to Warner,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,1.2,"Aniket Choudhary to Warner, FOUR, smashed, width on offer from Choudhary, Warner gets forward and thumps it over mid-off, couple of bounces and over the ropes",Aniket Choudhary to Warner,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,10.2,"Binny to Dhawan, FOUR, oh boy. He's toying around with the bowling out here. Binny looks to go wide outside off with the shortened length as well. But Dhawan in all his confidence walks across, crouches and half-pulls, half-sweeps it past the reach of the man at 45-degrees behind square",Binny to Dhawan,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,11.5,"Aravind to Yuvraj, FOUR, here's the pick up. Vintage Yuvraj. Helped by an allying half volley on the pads at gentle pace and all he does with it is lovingly lofts his flick. All the timing and a bounce into the mid-wicket fence",Aravind to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,12.1,"Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj, FOUR, streaky. But the runs keeps leaking. Does it really matter how. Wide, half way down the track and Yuvraj anticipates the ball to fizz up in flat batting it across. There's barely any climb, and all he gets is the inside edge to impart the direction in guiding it just past the sticks",Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,12.3,"Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj, FOUR, and it keeps getting better. Rocks back, stands tall, waits for the short drag down to sit up and swats in his swivel. All the crunch in the timing to reintroduce it back into the fence",Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,13.1,"Watson to Yuvraj, FOUR, back to the usual. Is this a surprise anymore. This time the skipper decides to test him with a short one, one that neither has the pace nor the bounce. And obliged with a swat. As flat as you'd want",Watson to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,14.1,"Aravind to Henriques, FOUR, on the charge. And the slap. The combo bags yet another fence hunter. Walks down, intercepts the length and gets on top of the bounce of this back of a length delivery in flaying it in front of square",Aravind to Henriques,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,16.3,"Tymal Mills to Yuvraj, FOUR, head on. The battle continues. With Mills keen on cramping him up with the short pepper gets it barely up to the ribs. Just when he spots the bat going flat and the face pointing upwards in hooking it away. Behind square it flies",Tymal Mills to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,17.3,"Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj, FOUR, a salute in celebration. Takes the bat to his head in holding it up to his team mates inside. Covers all his sticks with a shuffle and after getting bored of the wides throws the kitchen sink at it and slaps it over point. #HisFastestIPLFifty",Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,18.2,"Tymal Mills to Yuvraj, FOUR, full, down leg. Nothing right with that. Certainly not if fine leg is inside. Certainly not if that man is Chris Gayle. All Yuvraj has to do is get the bat down in giving it some tickle. And places it wide and into the ropes",Tymal Mills to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,2.0,"Aniket Choudhary to Henriques, FOUR, eventful first over from Choudhary, a wicket and 16 runs. Another freebie to end his over, short and wide outside off, Henriques was all over it as he cracked it square past point, beats the inner ring and rolls away to the fence",Aniket Choudhary to Henriques,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,4.5,"Aravind to Henriques, FOUR, too short from Aravind, can't bowl those at his pace. Henriques swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side for a boundary",Aravind to Henriques,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,5.1,"Watson to Dhawan, FOUR, gentle loosener from Watson, short and on Dhawan's hips, he swivels across, uses the pace on the ball and helps it behind square on the on-side for a boundary",Watson to Dhawan,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,5.2,"Watson to Dhawan, FOUR, lovely shot, Dhawan is getting into his groove now. Comes down the track, doesn't get close to the ball, that allows him to free his arms and drill it back past the umpire, no need to run for those",Watson to Dhawan,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,5.4,"Watson to Dhawan, FOUR, juicy full-toss and Dhawan has put it away, turning out to be an expensive start from Watson. Dhawan leans into the shot and finds the gap wide of mid-off, no need to run for those",Watson to Dhawan,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,5.5,"Watson to Dhawan, FOUR, make that four fours of the over, banged in short and on the stumps, Dhawan swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side. Watson was expensive in the final of IPL 2016, he has started badly here once again",Watson to Dhawan,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,0.4,"Dinda to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, thank you Dinda says Parthiv Patel as he clips a leg-side dross fine to claim his first boundary",Dinda to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,1.1,"Chahar to Buttler, FOUR, length ball outside off and Buttler is away. Swats it across the line and gets it wide of mid-on",Chahar to Buttler,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,1.3,"Chahar to Buttler, FOUR, shuffles across and flicks a ball from middle stump, easily done. With fine leg inside the ring that was always asking for trouble, Buttler obliged",Chahar to Buttler,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,10.5,"Zampa to Nitish Rana, FOUR, Zampa not getting the googly right. Again down leg and this time Rana gets a bit of bat/glove on that. The ball races away fine beating the short fine fielder",Zampa to Nitish Rana,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,14.1,"Tahir to Pollard, FOUR, Pollard welcomes him with a thumping drive. Bit of air and Pollard plants his front foot forward, smashed it straight back over the bowler's head. Didn't bother to run, he knew he had middled it",Tahir to Pollard,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,15.1,"Zampa to Pollard, FOUR, Pollard goes downtown once more and gets the desired result. Zampa goes fuller with the tossed up delivery and Pollard drills it straight back at Zampa, who is slow to get down and stop it",Zampa to Pollard,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,18.0,"Dinda to Pollard, FOUR, unlucky and Dinda have been synonyms today. Full and outside off, Pollard throws everything he's got at that and the outside edge flies away fine and Dinda just stands there in his teapot position",Dinda to Pollard,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,19.4,"Dinda to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, four more. Already 22 off the over. A game-changing over this. Fifty up for Dinda. Full and wide outside off, Pandya throws the kitchen sink at that and the outside edge flies wide of Dhoni",Dinda to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,2.2,"Dinda to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, sat up on a perfect length to be smashed, Parthiv Patel rocks back and nails the pull over mid-wicket. Take four!",Dinda to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,2.5,"Dinda to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, this pitch is a belter, 180 is a must. Half-volley outside off, Parthiv Patel stands tall and slams it straight of mid-off who dives in vain",Dinda to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,4.1,"Tahir to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, floated full on leg-stump, Parthiv Patel sits up and brooms it away with sheer disdain, rocketed away behind square",Tahir to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,5.4,"Chahar to Buttler, FOUR, gives himself a lot of room as he skates down the pitch, pierces the gap between extra cover and mid-off to perfection. Fast hands, full flow of the willow. Jos-outrageously-talented-Buttler",Chahar to Buttler,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,0.2,"Southee to Mayank Agarwal, FOUR, edged and four, streaky but Mayank will take those. There wasn't a first slip, Buttler dived to his left from second, but can't get to the ball. On a good length and holding its line outside off, Agarwal just hung his bat at that, the edge bisected the keeper and second slip to perfection",Southee to Mayank Agarwal,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,1.1,"Hardik Pandya to Rahane, FOUR, he's peirced the gap to perfection, just a tiny gap between the fielder at point and cover-point and Rahane found it. Played with an open face, allowed the ball to come onto him and gets it in the gap past point",Hardik Pandya to Rahane,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,1.2,"Hardik Pandya to Rahane, FOUR, edged and four, on a good length and in that channel outside off, drew Rahane into the drive, he went with hard hands and gets a thick edge past the lone slip, rolls away to the fence in a hurry",Hardik Pandya to Rahane,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,1.5,"Hardik Pandya to Rahane, FOUR, lovely shot, on a good length and well outside off, Rahane gets a big stride forward and lifts it over the head of the man at mid-off, couple of bounces and over the ropes",Hardik Pandya to Rahane,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,11.4,"Bumrah to Stokes, FOUR, heaves the pull away over mid-wicket. He was quickly in position for that. Short of length from Bumrah and the ball just sits up. Stokes drags it from outside off with a lot of muscle",Bumrah to Stokes,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,12.3,"McClenaghan to Smith, FOUR, plants his back foot at least a couple of feet outside off, rocks back, and mows the pull through square leg. The footwork had Smith written all over it",McClenaghan to Smith,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,12.5,"McClenaghan to Smith, FOUR, that will run away. McClenaghan strays in line and bowls it on leg-stump. Smith simply had to glance it away past the fielder at short fine leg. Neat wrists",McClenaghan to Smith,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,13.1,"Pollard to Smith, FOUR, oh poor ball. A short of length delivery which sits up around the waist and Smith drags it away past short fine leg. Big decision to get Pollard in here",Pollard to Smith,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,14.1,"Southee to Stokes, FOUR, he's absolutely crashed this through extra-cover. A full, wide ball with mid-off up. Not sure what the thinking is. Whatever it is, the execution of it is way off target. Misses the yorker by a long way and Stokes pummels the drive",Southee to Stokes,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,15.1,"Hardik Pandya to Stokes, FOUR, rare error in the field from Pollard. It would actually be harsh in calling that an error for most fielders, but this is Pollard we're talking about. A mistimed slog from Stokes. However, he still places it to the left of long-on where Pollard sprints and dives across trying to flick the ball in, but fails to get a hand",Hardik Pandya to Stokes,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,17.0,"Bumrah to Smith, FOUR, how good is he! Susses out the plan from Bumrah based on the line he's been bowling in this over so far, waits on the ball and just slices it past short third man",Bumrah to Smith,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,18.0,"McClenaghan to Smith, FOUR, that's been dragged all the way to the wide long-on fence. Pure despair for McClenaghan. He's bowled this so wide of off and to see the ball being swatted into the on-side is downright demoralizing",McClenaghan to Smith,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,18.5,"Bumrah to Dhoni, FOUR, there we go. Dhoni isn't to be denied for too long. A bit shorter than the previous couple of deliveries, and Dhoni pulls it away to the fine leg boundary. One bounce and over",Bumrah to Dhoni,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,2.4,"Southee to Rahane, FOUR, cracking shot, on a good length and just outside off, Rahane leans forward on the drive, seemed to have checked his shot at the lst moment. It went in the air and past Southee, beat mid-off's sprawling dive to his right and rolls away to the fence",Southee to Rahane,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,5.1,"McClenaghan to Smith, FOUR, clubbed, made a great noise as the bat connected with the ball. Length delivery outside off, Smith shuffles across and heaves it over wide mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes",McClenaghan to Smith,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,5.4,"McClenaghan to Rahane, FOUR, lovely, this is exquisite cricket from Rahane, back of a length and well outside off, he waits on it, opens the face of the bat and steers it to the left of wide slip, beats the man getting across from the deep",McClenaghan to Rahane,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,7.3,"Krunal Pandya to Smith, FOUR, cracking shot, short and wide from Krunal, Smith doesn't need a second invitation, hangs back and cuts it square on the off-side, beats the fielder in the deep with ease",Krunal Pandya to Smith,FOUR
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,8.2,"Hardik Pandya to Rahane, FOUR, fifty for Rahane. This was banged in short by Hardik, Rahane took his eyes off the ball, still went through with the pull, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes. Hardik looks amused, that ball didn't deserve a boundary",Hardik Pandya to Rahane,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,0.2,"Boult to Roy, FOUR, cracking shot, Roy is off and running in his IPL career. On a good length and just outside off, he leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and drives it back past the non-striker, no need to run for those",Boult to Roy,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,0.5,"Boult to Roy, FOUR, nicely played by Roy, width on offer from Boult. He leans into the shot, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and steers it behind square on the on-side, gets it past backward point and into the fence",Boult to Roy,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,1.3,"Chawla to Roy, FOUR, lovely, the reverse sweep in full flow from Roy, gets down low and gets it into the gap behind square on the off-side. It was picked up from the middle-stump line as well",Chawla to Roy,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,11.5,"Boult to Raina, FOUR, a well-controlled pull shot from Raina. Boult did not get height on the short of length delivery, just above the waist and Raina got on top of that nicely, rolled his wrists and struck it behind square, beating deep square leg with ease",Boult to Raina,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,12.2,"Narine to Karthik, FOUR, Pandey tried his best, but the ball still found a way to reach the fence. Width offered outside off, Karthik maintains a low base and drills it in front of square, Pandey runs across from sweeper cover, dives and flicks it in but the ball backspins and touches the rope",Narine to Karthik,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,14.4,"Narine to Karthik, FOUR, for the umpteenth time today Narine has landed it on a shortish length, sat up nicely for Karthik, who cut it away fiercely square of the wicket. Timed it superbly as it beat the sweeper cover comfortably",Narine to Karthik,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,17.4,"Boult to Raina, FOUR, it is all going Raina's way. He might walk on water today if he wants and get away with it. A well-directed yorker, Raina brings his bat down and squirts it off the inside edge to the fine leg fence. Not far away from the leg-pole",Boult to Raina,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,18.0,"Boult to Karthik, FOUR, Boult misses the yorker and Karthik is in no mood to let him off, doesn't bother to get his front leg in line with the delivery, just goes through the line and smacks it straight down the ground",Boult to Karthik,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,18.4,"Woakes to Karthik, FOUR, Karthik is playing a blinder here. Woakes goes short and outside off, it was the off-speed delivery and Karthik spotted it early, carves it up and over backward point. No need to run for those",Woakes to Karthik,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,19.0,"Woakes to Raina, FOUR, 16 runs off the over and not the best of outings for Woakes on IPL debut. He finishes with 3-0-35-0. Once more the slower delivery is on the shortish length, Raina waits and cuts it behind square, splitting backward point and short third man to perfection",Woakes to Raina,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,19.3,"Boult to Karthik, FOUR, off-pace delivery and once more Karthik read it early, he waited in his crease and stayed leg-side of the ball, lofts it handsomely over the extra cover fielder. All timing there from the Tamil Nadu man",Boult to Karthik,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,19.4,"Boult to Karthik, FOUR, Karthik does a ABD. The reverse sccop. Full delivery and close to the yorker length, Karthik switches his stances and sends it over the short third man fielder, almost went the distance",Boult to Karthik,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,2.2,"Narine to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, that's a shocker from Kuldeep and he concedes four runs. This was dropped short and wide of off, McCullum backed away and cut it straight to backward point. Kuldeep dived over the ball and ends up conceding a boundary",Narine to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,20.0,"Boult to Raina, FOUR, Raina finishes off in style. Very full and outside off, Raina crouches low, opens the bat face and drives it square on the off-side, the field was up and that was played beautifully",Boult to Raina,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,4.3,"Narine to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, cracking shot, poor ball from Narine, drops this one short and wide of off, McCullum makes room and cracks it over cover, couple of bounces and over the ropes",Narine to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,4.5,"Narine to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, Narine has been too short today, drags his length down once again. McCullum rocks back and pulls him past the square leg umpire",Narine to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,5.1,"Woakes to Raina, FOUR, nicely played! Fraction fuller and on the stumps, Raina leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and punches it back at the bowler. Woakes got a hand onto it, but it still beats mid-off to the fence",Woakes to Raina,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,5.3,"Woakes to Raina, FOUR, this is excellent cricket from Raina, made room as he came down the track. Woakes spotted it and followed him - Raina is good enough to tuck it past square leg, the man in the deep is very square and has no chance",Woakes to Raina,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,6.5,"Kuldeep Yadav to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, Kuldeep can't afford to drop short on this pitch. McCullum rocks back and pulls it through mid-wicket, bisects the two men in the deep to a nicety",Kuldeep Yadav to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
2373690,GL 1st Inns,8.0,"Woakes to Raina, FOUR, that ruins the over for Woakes, leg-stump half-volley, all Raina had to do was get some bat on that. Once he did - fine-leg, who was inside the ring had no chance",Woakes to Raina,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,1.0,"P Kumar to Chris Lynn, FOUR, just goes through with a wild slog across the line, no timing whatsoever. All power. To Lynn's delight, it went in the gap behind the square leg umpire. First boundary for KKR",P Kumar to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,1.4,"D Kulkarni to Gambhir, FOUR, stand and deliver! Half-volley in the slot, Gambhir won't miss out, watches the ball closely and dismisses it out of his sight",D Kulkarni to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,10.3,"Gony to Gambhir, FOUR, both of them have just played themselves in such good form here. Full ball outside off, Gambhir clears his front leg and crashes it inside-out to send it to the wide long-off fence. Superb hand-eye co-ordination",Gony to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,10.5,"Gony to Gambhir, FOUR, really ordinary bowling. It's a gentle short of length delivery on off-stump, the ball sits up for Gambhir who bludgeons it through mid-wicket",Gony to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,11.0,"Gony to Gambhir, FOUR, awful from Gony. He bangs it in very short but the speedometer just shows 128kph. The ball was actually on its way down when Gambhir slashed it over backward point. GL being clobbered out there",Gony to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,11.2,"Shadab Jakati to Gambhir, FOUR, down the track in a flash, right to the pitch of the ball, and driven so beautifully over the covers. The trick in the shot was that he delayed the charge and came out only when the ball was released",Shadab Jakati to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,14.2,"D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn, FOUR, short of length, probably an off-cutter, Lynn mows the ball in front of long-leg who comes running forward for the catch. But the ball drops well short and then bounces over him",D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,2.1,"Gony to Gambhir, FOUR, that's spanked! The open stance helps him figure the line and length quickly, uses all his might to smash it straight down the ground",Gony to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Gony to Chris Lynn, FOUR, Chris Lynn and his golf hits I tellya. This isn't off the middle, but that bottom hand power and the baseball swing takes it the distance, just one bounce and over the long-on ropes",Gony to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,3.1,"Shivil to Gambhir, FOUR, rank long hop, Gambhir says thank you. Short, down leg, Gambhir swivels and nails the pull behind square",Shivil to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,4.0,"Shivil to Chris Lynn, FOUR, too much width gestures Raina as soon as he saw the ball flying over backward point. Tad short and Lynn pounced on the width on offer, slices the cut and gets four",Shivil to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,4.5,"D Kulkarni to Gambhir, FOUR, 50-partnership. Clears his front leg and goes bam over mid-on. Right out of the screws",D Kulkarni to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,5.1,"Shivil to Gambhir, FOUR, Shivil Koushik isn't learning. Keeps landing it short and gets smacked. Gambhir rocks onto his back foot and all he needed to do was get it over the fielder, did it with sheer ease",Shivil to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,5.2,"Shivil to Gambhir, byes, FOUR, keeps low and nutmegs DK, Gambhir didn't pick it, neither did the keeper, runs are runs",Shivil to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"Shivil to Gambhir, FOUR, sits on one knee and chips the slog-sweep over mid-wicket, excellent batting this from GG",Shivil to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,5.5,"Shivil to Gambhir, FOUR, outside edge and four! Opens the bat face to steer, the edge flies to the right of Kulkarni who dives belatdely",Shivil to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,6.0,"Shivil to Gambhir, FOUR, make that 20 off the over. Gambhir has raced off to 40 in no-time. A real dart on the pads, Gambhir milks it off his pads. Easy peasy",Shivil to Gambhir,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,6.2,"Dwayne Smith to Chris Lynn, FOUR, stands tall in the crease and flat-bats a shortish delivery straight down the ground",Dwayne Smith to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,8.1,"Shivil to Chris Lynn, FOUR, Shivil Koushik's night keeps getting worse. Fires it short and wide, Lynn gets a feather of an edge on the attempted cut, the edge runs past DK's gloves",Shivil to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,0.3,"Dinda to Amla, FOUR, edged and four! Streaky way to get off the mark, but Amla won't mind. Seam-up delivery that shapes away a tad, Amla chases it with a slash and gets a fat outside edge. The ball flies between slip and short third man. First boundary of the innings",Dinda to Amla,FOUR
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,1.2,"Christian to Vohra, FOUR, shot! Uses the width outside off and bounce and elevates it over backward point to collect his first boundary",Christian to Vohra,FOUR
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,13.2,"R Bhatia to Maxwell, FOUR, backs away and then the sledge hammer does the rest. Just like a warrior, wields his weapon to axe the ball past the man at cover",R Bhatia to Maxwell,FOUR
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,14.2,"Stokes to Maxwell, FOUR, PHHUUUUFFFFF! Such power. He bulldozes that one through the off-side and the man at cover had no chance as there was a lot of room on it",Stokes to Maxwell,FOUR
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,18.2,"Stokes to Miller, FOUR, short ball and the swivelled pull. Picks up the length quickly and pivots on his back foot to send it speeding towards the backward square region for a four",Stokes to Miller,FOUR
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,2.0,"Christian to Amla, FOUR, 13 off the over after bowling a brilliant first ball. Length ball down leg, Amla gets inside the line and flicks it well past the short fine leg fielder. Easy runs",Christian to Amla,FOUR
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,3.2,"Christian to Saha, FOUR, nicely done! Shortish delivery outside off, Saha hops, gets on top of the bounce and forces it wide of point. The ball races away into the fence",Christian to Saha,FOUR
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,4.4,"Stokes to Saha, FOUR, Saha has come out with a positive intent and that is paying dividends. Finds the gap beautifully on his cover drive. No need to run for shots like that",Stokes to Saha,FOUR
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,4.5,"Stokes to Saha, FOUR, four more! Safest shot to play is hit it down the ground. Sees the length on a fuller side and lofts it down the ground, left of the bowler and right of mid-on. Safe shot",Stokes to Saha,FOUR
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,5.5,"Tahir to Axar, FOUR, sloppy from Rajat Bhatia at short fine! He was put off by the appeal for lbw from the keeper and Tahir. It was the slider which was very full. Axar just about brings his bat down and gets a bit of wood on it. Bhatia over-runs to his left and allows the ball to go past him",Tahir to Axar,FOUR
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,10.5,"Stoinis to Stokes, FOUR, imparts his powers of guiding the edge where he wants. Is happy to stay away from the line, giving his long levers some breathing space and just slashes at a slanter. An obvious outside edge and an even more obvious empty cordon for some free runs here",Stoinis to Stokes,FOUR
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,12.4,"T Natarajan to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, pure timing. And grace. With a sink down on a knee, Tiwary decides to free his arms at a wide overpitched delivery outside off in the form of a slice. Such is the meat on this that he doesn't even bother keeping it down. Almost all the way",T Natarajan to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,13.3,"Axar to Stokes, FOUR, gets a long hop. A rank one. And all he has to do is decide where to deposit this one. Decides mid-wicket it is again to take the brunt. Ensures that he doesn't get up early and once again puts his spinning back foot to use in whisking it into the fence",Axar to Stokes,FOUR
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,16.0,"Stoinis to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, they're turning it on. Tiwary joins the act now. Is mighty helped by a horror line always drifting down leg. Has to ensure that he gets some wood on it and he does it with aplomb. Gets enough to muscle it heave behind square and beat the lone man perched out there",Stoinis to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,18.5,"Mohit Sharma to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, a real drag down. The Mohit slower back hander but half way down the ground. All the time for the adjustment and Tiwary does it in executing his crouched pull. Axar did get a hand in his stretch at the fence, the power imparted was enough to burst through a wall though",Mohit Sharma to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,19.2,"Sandeep Sharma to Christian, FOUR, oh dear. Spots Christian running inside and fires one way down leg. Christian with his stalking eyes always on the ball gets his bat out on the horizontal swiping mode and scoops it away",Sandeep Sharma to Christian,FOUR
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,19.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Christian, FOUR, more of the same. The ploy here from Sandeep refuses to change and Christian too refuses to stand up on his feet against this length. Does all he can to get under the ball and keeps his bat on the scoop. This time right over the keeper",Sandeep Sharma to Christian,FOUR
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,3.5,"Mohit Sharma to Rahane, FOUR, opens the face of the blade on impact and runs it down to third man for a four. Cheeky from Rahane as used the pace of the bowler and knew his angles to perfection",Mohit Sharma to Rahane,FOUR
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,4.4,"Sandeep Sharma to Smith, FOUR, gets the room to free his arms and creams the ball away into the covers. No one moved as the ball sped away into the off-side",Sandeep Sharma to Smith,FOUR
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,4.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Smith, FOUR, creates room by going leg-sidish, got the room to expand his arms and then threads the ball away between cover and extra cover for back-to-back fours. Innovation and Smith go hand in hand",Sandeep Sharma to Smith,FOUR
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,6.4,"T Natarajan to Smith, FOUR, shot of the day? Shot of the tourney so far? Pardon the exaggeration but that was serene from the skipper. That was a slower delivery and the batsman just leant his weight forward on it with a straight face of the bat touching the ball. The man at mid-on and at long-off dived over the ball to allow a deserving four to the skipper",T Natarajan to Smith,FOUR
7088566,DC 1st Inns,0.5,"Stanlake to Billings, FOUR, loose delivery. It's drifting onto the pads and all Billings has to do is help it on its way. RCB can ill afford these errors, especially when they're defending a sub-par score",Stanlake to Billings,FOUR
7088566,DC 1st Inns,10.3,"Stanlake to Samson, FOUR, that's quite the blooper from Mills at third man. He might have taken his eyes off and the ball sneaks through him and over the ropes. Nice little glide from Samson, shouldn't have been anything more than a single",Stanlake to Samson,FOUR
7088566,DC 1st Inns,12.2,"I Abdulla to Pant, FOUR, yeah, Abdulla is in a fix here. He doesn't want to be bowling in Abdulla's arc, but there is no one out in the deep to protect the cut either. He ends up straying wide of off and Pant slaps it through point",I Abdulla to Pant,FOUR
7088566,DC 1st Inns,15.1,"Tymal Mills to Pant, FOUR, Pant keeps stroking them beautifully at the other end. He clearly holds the fate of his team now. It's a full ball on off and Pant has timed the pants of it as he flicks it through mid-wicket. The placement is brilliant too",Tymal Mills to Pant,FOUR
7088566,DC 1st Inns,16.1,"Watson to Pat Cummins, FOUR, Watson has erred big-time with the leg-cutter and Cummins gets him away. It's well down the leg-side and Cummins whips it over short fine leg for four. It was so close to clearing the boundary",Watson to Pat Cummins,FOUR
7088566,DC 1st Inns,2.1,"Stanlake to Tare, FOUR, picked away into the leg-side again. Stanlake searching for swing, pitching it right up, but the ball goes on with the angle and ends up on the pads. He has to adjust his line. Too many freebies",Stanlake to Tare,FOUR
7088566,DC 1st Inns,3.0,"Stanlake to Tare, FOUR, oh well, put the mockers on him there. But again, as soon as he tries to pitch the ball up expecting it to swing, he ends up on the pads. Whipped away gloriously from Tare over square leg",Stanlake to Tare,FOUR
7088566,DC 1st Inns,3.2,"I Abdulla to Tare, FOUR, that's flown between keeper and slip. Gayle, standing at slip, didn't even have time to react. It was too close to cut. Tare made some room and slashed at it off the stumps. Lucky to get away. Not just get away, he's gotten four",I Abdulla to Tare,FOUR
7088566,DC 1st Inns,5.0,"Tymal Mills to Nair, FOUR, climbs from a back of a length, finds the outside edge pretty high up on the bat and runs away to the third man boundary. Nair was driving on the up there. Highly ambitious",Tymal Mills to Nair,FOUR
7088566,DC 1st Inns,9.4,"Tymal Mills to Pant, FOUR, short of length into the body, Pant swivels across on the back foot and helps the pull behind square. He's placed it in the gap perfectly. Fine leg and deep square leg have no chance. Pant taking Mills on",Tymal Mills to Pant,FOUR
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,0.2,"Zaheer to Watson, FOUR, cracking shot, nice way to get going, that should give Watson plenty of confidence, length delivery on his pads, he prods across and clips it in front of square on the on-side, beats the infield and rolls away to the fence",Zaheer to Watson,FOUR
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,0.4,"Zaheer to Watson, FOUR, Watson is at his best in the opening slot and he has started well for RCB. On a good length and well outside off, he leans forward, plays with an open face and drives it on the up, beats cover and rolls away to the fence",Zaheer to Watson,FOUR
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,1.1,"Chris Morris to Watson, FOUR, Cummins makes a mess of a simple stop and concedes a boundary. On a good length and holding its line outside off, Watson went for the big drive, gets a thick edge over backward point. Cummins did all the running, slid and stopped the ball, but it hit his legs and rolled onto the ropes",Chris Morris to Watson,FOUR
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,1.4,"Chris Morris to Gayle, FOUR, creamed, low full-toss from Morris, Gayle waits on it, leans forward and punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats cover-point and rolls away to the fence",Chris Morris to Gayle,FOUR
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,11.2,"Pat Cummins to Binny, FOUR, much needed boundary for RCB, on a good length and angling back into the right-hander, he uses the pace on the bat, opens up slightly and shovels it wide of mid-wicket. Mishra put in the dive - but in vain",Pat Cummins to Binny,FOUR

7088566,RCB 1st Inns,13.2,"Brathwaite to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, cracking shot, that's Kedar's own version of MSD's helicopter shot. This was full and on the stumps, Kedar was deep inside the crease as he whipped it wide of mid-wicket, no chance for the man running across from long-on",Brathwaite to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,14.4,"Zaheer to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, mistimed shots are finding the gaps now, this was short and on the stumps, Kedar was late on the pull, gets a top-edge - the fielder at square leg was inside the ring and Kedar has managed to get it over his head",Zaheer to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR

7088566,RCB 1st Inns,4.0,"Chris Morris to Mandeep, FOUR, that ruins the over for Morris, another full-toss, but this time on Mandeep's pads, he gets inside the line and helps it on its way. Nice way to get going",Chris Morris to Mandeep,FOUR

7200146,GL 1st Inns,15.3,"Cutting to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, that's an awful ball from Cutting. Offers width, by bowling it well outside off, Smith goes deep in his crease and carves it over point. 50-run stand comes up between the two",Cutting to Dwayne Smith,FOUR

The crowd going bonkers",Rajpoot to Nitish Rana,FOUR
9873957,MI 1st Inns,19.2,"Boult to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, that is probably the blunder which will cost KKR the match. It shouldn't have been any more than a single.

9873957,MI 1st Inns,19.5,"Boult to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, full on the pads, and Hardik has done it! He whips it away past a diving Rajpoot at the fine leg boundary before running down and cutting a pose for the camera",Boult to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
9873957,MI 1st Inns,2.5,"Boult to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, a shot that should make him feel better. Boult errs in his length slight and that is enough for Parthiv to punish him, driven beautifully wide of mid-off and the ball raced away to the fence",Boult to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
9873957,MI 1st Inns,4.1,"Narine to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, rank long hop to start Narine's spell, Parthiv picked the bones out of the pull shot, rocks back and nails it wide of the mid-wicket fielder. No need to run for those",Narine to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
9873957,MI 1st Inns,7.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Nitish Rana, FOUR, a freebie from Kuldeep to welcome Rana. Googly which is short and down leg, Rana went for the big pull and under edge it fine. The man in the deep was square and had no chance",Kuldeep Yadav to Nitish Rana,FOUR
2604889,KXIP 1st Inns,0.3,"Stanlake to Amla, FOUR, Amla is off and running. Stanlake loses his radar and sprays it on the pads, Amla will not miss out on those. Just nonchalantly whips it past square leg. The ball raced away to the fence at MACH 3",Stanlake to Amla,FOUR
2604889,KXIP 1st Inns,1.2,"I Abdulla to Amla, FOUR, fabulous shot from Amla. Don't offer him width, not even half a foot. If you give him half a foot, he will take it into a mile. Just extends his hands and lifts it effortlessly over extra cover",I Abdulla to Amla,FOUR
2604889,KXIP 1st Inns,11.4,"Watson to Amla, FOUR, it's down the leg side and Amla tickles it away for four! The man at fine leg had no chance. A fine fifty from the South African. This knock has ensured that KXIP are chasing this down without much of a problem",Watson to Amla,FOUR

2604889,KXIP 1st Inns,3.1,"Watson to Vohra, FOUR, in the airrr and just over a leaping Negi. Vohra would've had his heart in his mouth for a moment. A short of length delivery outside off, there was width on offer so Vohra went after for a rasping cut. Didn't bother to keep it down but luckily for him it flies over the point fielder",Watson to Vohra,FOUR
2604889,KXIP 1st Inns,3.2,"Watson to Vohra, FOUR, almost.. Watson overcorrects his length, bowls fuller this time. Vohra flexes his arms and lifts it over mid-off. Just clears the fielders and runs away to the fence",Watson to Vohra,FOUR
2604889,KXIP 1st Inns,3.5,"Watson to Vohra, FOUR, third boundary of the over. Watson is not learning. This was much straighter, he is looking for some swing which is non existent at the moment. Full on the pads, Vohra gets inside the line and tickles it away to the fine leg fence. The fielder was inside the ring and Watson shouldn't have bowled it there",Watson to Vohra,FOUR
2604889,KXIP 1st Inns,4.3,"Stanlake to Amla, FOUR, threads the gap this time. Pure class from Amla. Stands still and lets his hands do the talking. Punches a back of a length delivery crisply through cover-point, beats the packed off-side field",Stanlake to Amla,FOUR
2604889,KXIP 1st Inns,5.4,"Tymal Mills to Vohra, FOUR, wow. Elegance written all over it. Shot of the day so far. Mills bowls a half-volley on the stumps, Vohra leans forward, presents a full bat face and drives it smoothly down the ground, beats mid-on",Tymal Mills to Vohra,FOUR
2604889,KXIP 1st Inns,9.3,"Tymal Mills to Maxwell, FOUR, you cannot keep Maxwell quiet for long. He gets into business, full at 146kph, Maxwell clears his front leg and bludgeons it back over the bowler's head. Brutal from Maxi!",Tymal Mills to Maxwell,FOUR
2604889,RCB 1st Inns,1.5,"Sandeep Sharma to de Villiers, FOUR, that was a poor piece of fielding from the man at third man. So de Villiers is off the mark straightaway in this IPL. Sandeep Sharma bowled a decent length ball outside off stump, just shaped away from the right-hander, de Villiers guided that with an angled bat past point and eventually managed to get a boundary",Sandeep Sharma to de Villiers,FOUR
2604889,RCB 1st Inns,17.2,"Mohit Sharma to Binny, FOUR, goes inside-out and cannons the ball over cover for a boundary. That was a full ball outside off and the batsman thwacks the ball over the fielder to get another boundary. Even Binny joins in the act",Mohit Sharma to Binny,FOUR
2604889,RCB 1st Inns,18.2,"Sandeep Sharma to de Villiers, FOUR, FIFTY for the combo! This man can do anything and everything with the willow. The pied piper of RCB treated the bowler as if he hails from Hamelin. That was full outside off and the batsman just steered the ball over the man at point",Sandeep Sharma to de Villiers,FOUR
2604889,RCB 1st Inns,2.2,"Mohit Sharma to Vishnu Vinod, FOUR, in the airrrrrr and just over the leaping Maxwell at mid-on. Vinod is known for his audacious stroke-play. He won't mind playing his shots in any situation. Shortish delivery from Mohit Sharma, Vinod smacks that from the crease, didn't get hold of it, more a sort of a pull shot it was, the ball just evaded the Punjab skipper",Mohit Sharma to Vishnu Vinod,FOUR
2604889,RCB 1st Inns,7.0,"Aaron to de Villiers, FOUR, Aaron missed the yorker by a yard or so and that was just what de Villiers wanted with the line being middle and leg. He waited for the ball to come and flicked it past the diving mid-wicket fielder",Aaron to de Villiers,FOUR
2604889,RCB 1st Inns,9.0,"T Natarajan to Mandeep, FOUR, and he gets lucky with an outside edge that runs away for four! No one at slip and third man can't cut that off.

2172197,DC 1st Inns,1.4,"Chahar to Samson, FOUR, classy stuff from Samson. Nothing much wrong with the delivery. Good length ball around off, Samson allowed it to do its bit before opening the bat face and directing it past the backward point fielder. Used the pace on the ball and timed it beautifully",Chahar to Samson,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,1.5,"Chahar to Samson, FOUR, consecutive boundaries for Samson. That should calm the nerves. Overpitched and Chahar is punished, Samson strides forward and creams the square drive through the packed off-side field. No need to run for that",Chahar to Samson,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,10.4,"Zampa to Pant, FOUR, tosses it up slow on middle and leg. Overpitched as well. Pant waits for the ball and drills it down the track. No chance for the long-on fielder",Zampa to Pant,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,15.3,"Stokes to Samson, FOUR, nice looking shot! Short ball, Samson has ample time to move across and pull it behind square on the leg-side. Well wide of the fine leg fielder. One bounce over the rope",Stokes to Samson,FOUR

2172197,DC 1st Inns,18.3,"Zampa to Chris Morris, FOUR, that's one helluva way to open your account! Leg-break outside off, Morris lofts it inside-out and gets off the mark with a boundary",Zampa to Chris Morris,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,19.0,"Zampa to Chris Morris, FOUR, the gamble hasn't paid off. A wicket was scalped, but the overall result - 22 runs off the 19th over. Flipper outside off, Morris crouches and lifts it inside out. No chance for long-off",Zampa to Chris Morris,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,19.2,"Stokes to Chris Morris, FOUR, that's a gross delivery! Short of a good length delivery with no pace behind it. Morris moves across and helps it away well wide of short fine. Runs away into the fence",Stokes to Chris Morris,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,19.4,"Stokes to Chris Morris, FOUR, that's a brilliant stroke! Stokes can't believe that. He didn't do much wrong there. It was bowled in the blockhole wide of off and Morris opens his bat face and drills the squeeze wide of point",Stokes to Chris Morris,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,2.1,"Dinda to Samson, FOUR, Samson has come out firing. Picked the length early on the short of length delivery, got his front leg up and nailed the pull in front of square. That came smack bang off the middle",Dinda to Samson,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,2.2,"Dinda to Samson, FOUR, fourth boundary in five balls for Samson. The start is getting better for DD. Dinda overcompensates and goes full outside off, Samson is up for it and cracks the drive past the diving cover-point fielder. Sped away to the fence",Dinda to Samson,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,2.4,"Dinda to Billings, FOUR, third boundary of the over and Dinda leaking runs here. Short and wide outside off, Billings throws the kitchen sink at that and the ball flies off the outside edge, over Faf at slip and into the third man fence",Dinda to Billings,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,3.2,"Chahar to Samson, FOUR, excellent batting. On a length and just outside off, Samson goes up and over cover, once he got it through the infield the result was going to be in his favour",Chahar to Samson,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,4.1,"Stokes to Samson, FOUR, Stokes too meted out with the same treatment. Good length ball outside off, Samson leans into the drive and places it square. It is a crowded off-side field and he's threaded that to perfection",Stokes to Samson,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,5.2,"Chahar to Billings, FOUR, not a boundary ball but that's T20. Back of length around off, Billings crouches a bit and swats it away wide of mid-on, not off the middle but he had enough wood on that",Chahar to Billings,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,5.3,"Chahar to Billings, FOUR, last over of the powerplay and Billings has decided to cash in. Advances and gets cramped for room, swings with all his might and drags it off the inner part of the bat to the left of short fine, Dinda can only escort the ball to the fence",Chahar to Billings,FOUR
2172197,DC 1st Inns,5.4,"Chahar to Billings, FOUR, poor delivery this and Chahar is made to pay. Sprays it down leg and that is easy pickings for any batsman, Billings stays inside the line and whips it fine. No chance for Dinda this time around",Chahar to Billings,FOUR
2172197,RPS 1st Inns,0.4,"Nadeem to Mayank Agarwal, FOUR, first boundary of the innings. Sweetly timed by Agarwal. Saw the ball dropped on a shortish length, pivoted back and flayed it through cover. This is a mickey-mouse outfield and it zooms away to the fence",Nadeem to Mayank Agarwal,FOUR
2172197,RPS 1st Inns,13.5,"Mishra to Zampa, FOUR, lovely shot, Mishra tosses one wider of off, Zampa gets a big stride forward and drills it through extra-cover, beats the man getting across to his left from long-off",Mishra to Zampa,FOUR

2172197,RPS 1st Inns,3.2,"Chris Morris to Mayank Agarwal, FOUR, wow. Delicate stuff from Agarwal.

2172197,RPS 1st Inns,5.2,"Chris Morris to Tripathi, FOUR, edged and four. Morris is not happy. Throws a wild stare at the batsman. On a length and just outside off, Tripathi went hard at it, gets an outside edge that races away to the third man fence",Chris Morris to Tripathi,FOUR
5054401,MI 1st Inns,0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Buttler, FOUR, slightly straighter from Bhuvneshwar and the batsman clips the ball away between mid-wicket and mid-on for a four. Hardly touched it and the ball sped away after he shuffled a tad across his sticks",Bhuvneshwar to Buttler,FOUR
5054401,MI 1st Inns,1.1,"Nehra to Buttler, FOUR, looks to defend and the ball trims the inside edge to run past the sticks. Cruel it is for the bowlers.

5054401,MI 1st Inns,1.3,"Nehra to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, serene! The format might demand slam bang wham. But a back foot cover drive with a lean into the shot and hitting it on top of the bounce is welcomed all day long. He trampled back to stroke it off the back foot",Nehra to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
5054401,MI 1st Inns,12.0,"Nehra to Nitish Rana, FOUR, he's sprayed it around a bit today, has Nehra. Short and wide and gives away the boundary to finish the over. Slashed over backward point by Rana",Nehra to Nitish Rana,FOUR
5054401,MI 1st Inns,15.4,"Nehra to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, 10 off 2 balls. Nehra continues to be expensive. Strays just a touch in line, bowls it on middle and leg, and Krunal Pandya glances it away past short fine leg",Nehra to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
5054401,MI 1st Inns,16.3,"Cutting to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, very wide outside off and Krunal Pandya somehow reaches out and then generates enough power to carve it over extra-cover. He's in a hurry now",Cutting to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
5054401,MI 1st Inns,16.5,"Cutting to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, off the top-edge or the glove, the ball lobs over Naman Ojha and runs away to the boundary.

5054401,MI 1st Inns,17.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Nitish Rana, FOUR, lofted over mid-off! He picks the slower ball, the length was pretty full outside off and Rana's focus is purely on timing. Doesn't go very hard at it. Brilliant batting",Bhuvneshwar to Nitish Rana,FOUR
5054401,MI 1st Inns,2.0,"Nehra to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, repeats the gait of the previous ball and gets an outside edge to run it down towards third man. He got wood on it and got it fine after just using the pace of the bowler. 15 off the over!",Nehra to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
5054401,MI 1st Inns,2.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Buttler, FOUR, errs in length, which is short, errs in line, which is wide. Enough said.

5054401,MI 1st Inns,3.4,"Nehra to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, nicely done as he wristily whips the ball in the air over the man at mid-on. A few bounces and into the fence. A length ball it was and the batsman did it with nonchalance",Nehra to Parthiv Patel,FOUR

5054401,MI 1st Inns,5.4,"Mustafizur to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, that was a chocolate brownie of a delivery and the batsman puts the icing on it with the help of an eyes-scream of a shot.

5054401,MI 1st Inns,5.5,"Mustafizur to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, the ramp now! He is pulling out all the tricks from his hat. Short ball bumped in well outside off and the batsman helped it on his way towards third man",Mustafizur to Parthiv Patel,FOUR

5054401,SRH 1st Inns,15.2,"Hardik Pandya to Yuvraj, FOUR, a fielding blip from Buttler and that's a boundary. Yuvi knew what was coming with the field set, stayed on the back foot and unveiled the cut with a glitter of left-hander's elegance.

5054401,SRH 1st Inns,16.1,"Malinga to Cutting, FOUR, the gangly Cutting makes his intentions clear. He wants to have a piece of slinga Malinga. Waits deep inside the crease and bludgeons a full ball back over the bowler's head",Malinga to Cutting,FOUR
5054401,SRH 1st Inns,16.2,"Malinga to Cutting, FOUR, that's a wood chopper! Takes on a full half-volley and slices the whacky-drive over a leaping exra cover. Bhajji was the fielder and he may have got a fingertip on that",Malinga to Cutting,FOUR
5054401,SRH 1st Inns,17.1,"Bumrah to Cutting, FOUR, slower ball alright, but serves too much of width. Ends up as a full toss, Cutting chips it over extra cover, easy peasy",Bumrah to Cutting,FOUR

5054401,SRH 1st Inns,2.2,"Harbhajan to Warner, FOUR, this is even better. This was not all that short but Warner made room for himself, stayed back and went inside out over cover, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes",Harbhajan to Warner,FOUR
5054401,SRH 1st Inns,4.1,"Malinga to Warner, FOUR, nicely played by Warner, it was the slower ball from Malinga, rolled his fingers across the seam.

3000439,KKR 1st Inns,9.3,"Axar to Uthappa, FOUR, poor ball from Axar, dropped it short and wide of off, Uthappa makes room and cuts it behind square on the off-side. Miller was caught wrong-footed and has no chance to recover",Axar to Uthappa,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,0.2,"Boult to Amla, FOUR, shoddy from Piyush Chawla, running around from fine leg. He's too stiff while bending and the ball slips underneath him. Swinging in on middle and leg, Amla clips it behind square leg and it shouldn't have been more than a couple",Boult to Amla,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,0.5,"Boult to Amla, FOUR, the swing from Boult takes him on the pads once more, Amla stays in the crease and whips a glance down to the fine leg boundary. Brisk start from the Kings XI",Boult to Amla,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,13.0,"U Yadav to Saha, FOUR, flashed and flashed hard. Umesh provides width for Saha, he throws his bat and ekes out a thick outside edge that flies past first slip",U Yadav to Saha,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,13.4,"de Grandhomme to Miller, FOUR, this is a bit streaky but Miller won't mind. Bangs it short, Miller went for the pull, gets a top-edge that flies over the keeper",de Grandhomme to Miller,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,17.0,"Boult to Saha, FOUR, that is an awful effort from Narine. Makes a royal mess of this one. Boult wears a cheeky smile on his face. It was a short ball outside off, Saha gets a top-edge as he tried to elevate it over third man. The ball lobs in the air and drops in front of Narine at third man, he fails to get his body behind the line of the ball and lets it go through making him look absolute silly",Boult to Saha,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,17.2,"U Yadav to Miller, FOUR, attempted yorker gone wrong for Umesh. Ends up offering a high full toss on off, Miller gets hit high on the willow but he manages it skew it past mid-off",U Yadav to Miller,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,18.2,"Boult to Mohit Sharma, FOUR, he's timed that well. Gets on top of the bounce, opens the bat face nicely and steers it past point. No chance for the third man fielder",Boult to Mohit Sharma,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,2.1,"Boult to Vohra, FOUR, ravishing cover drive from Vohra. This looks a belter of a pitch. This is no half-volley, but the ball is coming on so beautifully that Vohra just leans across and caresses it on the up. Awesome timing",Boult to Vohra,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,2.2,"Boult to Vohra, FOUR, third boundary today that Boult has conceded off the pads. Just straying a touch with the swing. Curling in on leg, Vohra shuffles across and just tickles it through",Boult to Vohra,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,3.2,"Woakes to Amla, FOUR, deliberately goes up and over point. Ordinary delivery. Short of length with width on offer, Amla opens his wrists up as he slashes it away to lift it over the infield",Woakes to Amla,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,3.5,"Woakes to Vohra, FOUR, the boundaries keep coming as the bowlers keep erring in line. Full ball on the pads, fine leg is inside the ring, so Vohra effortlessly whips it over him and into the fence. KXIP off to a flying start",Woakes to Vohra,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,4.0,"Woakes to Vohra, FOUR, that's a risky shot but Vohra backs himself to ramp a short of length delivery into the third man boundary. He got it fine enough of the fielder. One bounce and over the ropes",Woakes to Vohra,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,5.3,"Chawla to Stoinis, FOUR, only slightly short, the ball slides in on leg, and Stoinis is quick to go back in the crease. He effortlessly whips a pull over square leg and beats long leg to his left",Chawla to Stoinis,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,8.2,"Woakes to Maxwell, FOUR, picked off his hips for six, is it? No, one bounce. So stylishly done. Loose from Woakes again, he bowls back of a length and bowls leg-stump. Maxwell languidly swivels outside the line and helps it on its way. Lovely wrists",Woakes to Maxwell,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,8.4,"Woakes to Amla, FOUR, short of length into the body, Amla wallops a pull through backward square leg. That's rocketed to the fence. Really poor from Woakes. He's been consistently short so far",Woakes to Amla,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,9.2,"Chawla to Maxwell, FOUR, four more. Flatter outside off but it's full again, and Maxwell smokes a flat-batted drive wide of long-off",Chawla to Maxwell,FOUR
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,9.3,"Chawla to Maxwell, FOUR, Chawla under serious pressure. This is scintillating batting. He goes wide of off again, and is carted over extra-cover again. An unabridged swing of the bat",Chawla to Maxwell,FOUR
3210359,MI 1st Inns,10.1,"Tymal Mills to Pollard, FOUR, in the blockhole, the ball chirps the toe-end of the bat and bisects the gap between the keeper and the slip fielder to race away to the fence. That was really full and was just outside off to force the batsman to jam his bat down on that",Tymal Mills to Pollard,FOUR
3210359,MI 1st Inns,11.2,"Binny to Pollard, FOUR, length ball outside off and the batsman flogs the ball away with the meaty bottom-hand coming into play. The gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket was easily pierced",Binny to Pollard,FOUR
3210359,MI 1st Inns,14.4,"Tymal Mills to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, fifty for the combo! He waited on that slower delivery and then dismissed it out of his sight with disdain.

3210359,MI 1st Inns,15.0,"Tymal Mills to Pollard, FOUR, full ball targetting the sticks and the batsman got enough wood on it to clip it away. The man from deep square who was Binny came running in to make the save but despite getting a hand on it, couldn't bend down enough to stop that. Second four of the over",Tymal Mills to Pollard,FOUR
3210359,MI 1st Inns,16.4,"Aravind to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, poor from Mills! That was dabbed away with soft hands and the fielder at short third man does the London Bridge and dives over it to open the floodgates for RCB. The momentum has again changed hands",Aravind to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
3210359,MI 1st Inns,18.1,"Tymal Mills to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, short ball, pulled away and no man in the deep mid-wicket region allows the ball to race away into the fence. Chahal from deep square ran across and the ball sandwiches between him and the ground to ensure that he is in some pain. Hope he is OK as he has a grimacing expression on his face",Tymal Mills to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
3210359,MI 1st Inns,4.4,"Tymal Mills to Nitish Rana, FOUR, Rana is the man in form. Poor ball from Mills, slides one down leg, Rana gets across and whips it crisply behind square. No chance for the fine leg fielder",Tymal Mills to Nitish Rana,FOUR
3210359,RCB 1st Inns,12.5,"Krunal Pandya to de Villiers, byes, FOUR, byes signalled! The ball kept terribly low as de Villiers backed away to thwack it. The ball rolled down to beat the keeper through his legs and run away into the fence. Bumrah giving it a chase comes up with a comical effort - tried to flick it back and ended up lobbing the ball outside the boundary edge",Krunal Pandya to de Villiers,FOUR
3210359,RCB 1st Inns,14.0,"Bumrah to Kohli, FOUR, cheeky from the skipper as he opens the face of the blade and runs it past the diving keeper for a four",Bumrah to Kohli,FOUR

3210359,RCB 1st Inns,2.3,"Southee to Kohli, FOUR, awful start this has been for Southee. Overbakes and bangs it short, sits up nicely for Kohli, who skips back and muscles the pull in front of square on the on-side",Southee to Kohli,FOUR
3210359,RCB 1st Inns,2.4,"Southee to Kohli, FOUR, two fours in a row. ""He is looking ominous here,"" says Ravi Shaz on air. This was a half-volley on fifth stump line, Kohli brings those quicksilver wrists of his into play. Just gets inside the line and whips it past mid-on. Goes to the fence like a 'famous bullet phrase' to the fence",Southee to Kohli,FOUR
3210359,RCB 1st Inns,4.1,"Harbhajan to Gayle, FOUR, the chat has worked. Virat offered some advice to Gayle and next ball the big man slaps one to the fence. A quicker delivery outside off, Gayle goes back and flays the cut, through point. Zooms away to the fence.",Harbhajan to Gayle,FOUR
3210359,RCB 1st Inns,5.4,"McClenaghan to Gayle, FOUR, stand and deliver stuff from Gayle. Just flexes his arms and times the pants off this length ball. Races away through cover and no need to run for those",McClenaghan to Gayle,FOUR
3210359,RCB 1st Inns,8.1,"Harbhajan to Kohli, FOUR, buffet ball, as Geoff Boycott would say. Short and offers enough width, Kohli skips back and knives with a solid punch, the timing was brutal and it beats extra cover",Harbhajan to Kohli,FOUR
8517839,GL 1st Inns,0.1,"Ankit Sharma to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, that's a thick inside edge is what it is.

8517839,GL 1st Inns,1.0,"Ankit Sharma to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, now Ankit fires it short and Smith goes back to punch it through the covers. What a blistering start for GL! 16 off the over",Ankit Sharma to Dwayne Smith,FOUR

8517839,GL 1st Inns,14.4,"Stokes to Raina, FOUR, first poor delivery from Stokes. Half-volley outside off, Raina lofts him inside-out over extra cover. Smith running in from long-off gave up a little too early",Stokes to Raina,FOUR
8517839,GL 1st Inns,15.0,"Stokes to Raina, FOUR, that's timed to perfection! Save your legs. It rose just enough from a fullish length, Raina shows the full face of the bat as he spanks it through cover. No chance for the man in the deep",Stokes to Raina,FOUR

8517839,GL 1st Inns,2.0,"Lockie Ferguson to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, bludgeoned! A short of length delivery outside off which Smith smokes through mid-wicket.

8517839,GL 1st Inns,2.4,"SN Thakur to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, you don't bowl short to this guy, not unless you're express. Such fast hands as he dispatches a pull through mid-wicket. The man in the deep is too square",SN Thakur to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
8517839,GL 1st Inns,3.4,"Lockie Ferguson to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, 147kph on that length ball and Smith uses all of it to slice the ball over backward point.

8517839,GL 1st Inns,4.0,"Lockie Ferguson to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, a proper half-volley at the stumps, beautifully whipped away wide of mid-on. Excellent wrists from Smith. GL off to a flier",Lockie Ferguson to Dwayne Smith,FOUR
8517839,GL 1st Inns,5.2,"Tahir to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, lunges out at the ball and lofts it over mid-off. Interesting that he's gone after Tahir first ball. The ball was full enough to execute the shot and he took his opportunity",Tahir to Brendon McCullum,FOUR

8517839,RPS 1st Inns,10.5,"Raina to Stokes, FOUR, edged and four. Stokes won't mind that. Quicker and the ball straightens a touch, Stokes goes hard on the drive and the outside edge runs away fine. A welcome boundary for RPS",Raina to Stokes,FOUR

8517839,RPS 1st Inns,15.1,"Basil Thampi to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, brilliant timing. The ball races away past point. Back of a length outside off, Tiwary eases onto the back foot and punches it firmly. Good start to the over",Basil Thampi to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR

8517839,RPS 1st Inns,2.1,"P Kumar to Tripathi, FOUR, lovely shot! Nothing too fancy from Tripathi. Waited for the ball to do its bit - move away and used the width on offer to his advantage, carved it past the diving cover-point fielder and it raced across the turf",P Kumar to Tripathi,FOUR

Mohit bangs it short, Billings was committed to the pull, was hustled by pace, manages to get it off the higher part of his bat and skews it over mid-on",Mohit Sharma to Billings,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,1.5,"Mohit Sharma to Billings, FOUR, make that two in a row. Mohit goes shorter again, Billings is bred on English soil. Too easy for him, pulls it wide of mid-on. No need to run for those",Mohit Sharma to Billings,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,11.2,"Mohit Sharma to Billings, FOUR, with mid-wicket inside the ring, the pull is a safe shot. That is if you get it right. Billings was almost cramped for room, but got the pull high on the bat and placed it to the left of mid-wicket. No chance for long-on to cut it off",Mohit Sharma to Billings,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,12.3,"Axar to Billings, FOUR, Axar almost deceived his man. Saw the batsman advance and pushed it wider, Billings reached out and lofted it inside out, not off the meat of the bat but had enough to collect a boundary",Axar to Billings,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,13.2,"Maxwell to Pant, FOUR, long-off had around 10 yards to cover and he couldn't get there. That is the power of Pant. Races down the wicket and gets to the pitch of the ball, lofts it hard and over extra cover, one bounce and into the fence",Maxwell to Pant,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,14.3,"Cariappa to Pant, FOUR, wow! Width offered and Pant is all over it. There was a deep cover fielder and he beat him to his right. Short as well and Pant slaps it in front of square, raced away to the fence",Cariappa to Pant,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,14.4,"Cariappa to Pant, FOUR, even the mishits are going to the fence, thanks to some sloppy work by Morgan. Short and turning away, Pant pulls and the bottom hand comes off the handle, the ball goes to wide long-on, where Morgan allows it to escape",Cariappa to Pant,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,15.2,"Aaron to Chris Morris, FOUR, lovely! No fancy shots from Morris. He uses Aaron's extra pace to his advantage, stays leg-side of the short of length delivery, opens the bat face and directs it behind square on the off-side, split backward point and short third man expertly",Aaron to Chris Morris,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,16.0,"Aaron to Corey Anderson, FOUR, Anderson reminding everyone that he has the second fastest ODI hundred. The extra delivery costing Aaron four runs.

8351592,DC 1st Inns,17.1,"Sandeep Sharma to Corey Anderson, FOUR, round the wicket and dishes in a full toss, the idea was to nail the yorker, missed and Anderson slices it over the infield on the off-side.

8351592,DC 1st Inns,19.1,"Sandeep Sharma to Pat Cummins, FOUR, handy runs these for DD. Not a bad delivery by any means. The wide yorker outside off, Cummins crouches low, opens the bat face and steers it past the diving backward point fielder",Sandeep Sharma to Pat Cummins,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,19.2,"Sandeep Sharma to Pat Cummins, FOUR, yorker followed by a slow short of length delivery, Cummins was waiting for that, he stayed on the back foot and pulled it in front of square, bisected deep mid-wicket and long-on to perfection",Sandeep Sharma to Pat Cummins,FOUR

8351592,DC 1st Inns,2.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Billings, FOUR, you don't often see a batsman play sweep shot to a fast bowler. Let's call this Billings special. Buries on one knee and sweeps it fiercely behind square. Races away to the fence in a jiffy",Sandeep Sharma to Billings,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,4.2,"Aaron to Billings, FOUR, wow. That was hammered ferociously. Billings charges down the track and smacks it down the ground",Aaron to Billings,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,4.3,"Aaron to Billings, FOUR, Billings is teeing off like a golfer. Uses his feet again, stays a bit leg sidish this time. Fetches the heave from off and directs it through mid-wicket",Aaron to Billings,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,4.4,"Aaron to Billings, FOUR, three in a row. Problems aplenty for Aaron. Just not getting his line right.

8351592,DC 1st Inns,7.5,"Aaron to Billings, FOUR, streaky but he won't mind. Aaron sees the batsman back away and hurls it full outside off, Billings throws his bat and gets a thickish outside edge that flies through the vacant slip region",Aaron to Billings,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,8.4,"Cariappa to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, top shot from Iyer. Sees the leg-break early, lunges across, opens the bat face and steers it past point. The fielder in the deep gets across and puts in a dive but in vain",Cariappa to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,9.3,"Aaron to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, easy-peasy for Iyer. Vrooming down leg, Iyer gets inside the line and tickles it fine",Aaron to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
8351592,DC 1st Inns,9.5,"Aaron to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, brilliant placement from Iyer. Bisects two men in the deep to perfection. Showing a piece of geometry that would put Euclid to shame.

8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,11.5,"Corey Anderson to Miller, FOUR, his first boundary today and it's come off a thick inside edge past short fine. Anderson bowls this in the blockhole just outside off, Miller jams down on it and squirts it away past leg-stump",Corey Anderson to Miller,FOUR

8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,15.0,"Zaheer to Mohit Sharma, FOUR, he's unwittingly sliced that over short third man. A knuckle ball outside off, Mohit throws his hands at it, the bat-face opens on impact and the ball beautifully lobs over the infield. A bit of a helicopter from Mohit too",Zaheer to Mohit Sharma,FOUR
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,2.2,"Zaheer to Amla, FOUR, in the air and that's the first boundary of the innings! The knuckle ball on a shortish length, Amla walks down the track and pulls it over mid-wicket. There is no one in the deep and the ball races away",Zaheer to Amla,FOUR
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,3.0,"Zaheer to Amla, FOUR, shot! Perhaps, a safe shot. Stands tall, waits for the ball to come to him and launches this short of a good length delivery over mid-off. One bounce and into the fence",Zaheer to Amla,FOUR

8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,4.0,"Nadeem to Amla, FOUR, beautiful shot! See the ball, hit the ball, is the mantra.

8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,4.3,"Chris Morris to Amla, FOUR, wow! Elegant. Amla shuffles across a long way and flicks this full ball around off very fine. No chance for the man at short fine leg. The ball reached the fence in a hurry",Chris Morris to Amla,FOUR
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,5.1,"Pat Cummins to Eoin Morgan, FOUR, shot! Shortish ball that sits up nicely for Morgan to thwack the pull from outside off. Found the gap between mid-on and mid-wicket and the result was a boundary",Pat Cummins to Eoin Morgan,FOUR
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,9.2,"Pat Cummins to Eoin Morgan, FOUR, a boundary for KXIP after 24 balls. Morgan clears the front leg and spears a full ball through extra-cover. Mid-off was up in the ring and he just had to find the gap",Pat Cummins to Eoin Morgan,FOUR
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,9.5,"Pat Cummins to Eoin Morgan, FOUR, Morgan again. This time it's short and wide and Morgan slaps it hard through point. It beats the diving fielder inside the ring as well as the one at the boundary",Pat Cummins to Eoin Morgan,FOUR
7374716,GL 1st Inns,1.4,"Malinga to Raina, FOUR, and Raina takes full toll of the free-hit. Bends his back knee and crunches the cover drive wide of the diving extra cover fielder. Once it cleared him, there was none stopping that",Malinga to Raina,FOUR
7374716,GL 1st Inns,1.4,"Malinga to Raina, no ball, FOUR, Malinga oversteps and bowls a length ball on middle and leg. Raina shuffles across and tucks it very fine. The short fine leg fielder is pretty fine as well. Free-hit coming up",Malinga to Raina,FOUR

7374716,GL 1st Inns,16.2,"Bumrah to Karthik, no ball, FOUR, poor from Bumrah. First, he oversteps and the yorker is way outside off, Karthik stays low and drives it square on the off-side. No chance for the sweeper this time around",Bumrah to Karthik,FOUR
7374716,GL 1st Inns,16.3,"Bumrah to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, Bumrah has not get his radar right on his yorkers. A low full toss down leg, Kishan is almost down on his knee and swipes it behind square. McClenaghan at fine leg had no chance to cut that off",Bumrah to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
7374716,GL 1st Inns,17.0,"Bumrah to Karthik, FOUR, this is an ordinary over from Bumrah. 19 runs off it and he like Malinga has been expensive today.

7374716,GL 1st Inns,19.2,"Bumrah to Roy, FOUR, low full toss and Roy thumps it down the ground. Goes deep and leg-side to free his arms, with mid-off in the ring, he just had to place it wide of him, which he does and collects four",Bumrah to Roy,FOUR

7374716,MI 1st Inns,13.2,"Munaf Patel to Rohit, FOUR, Munaf is not a happy man. Short and wide outside off, Rohit cuts it over backward point, where the fielder did not make any effort to catch the ball. He might have lost it in the background. Jadeja was the fielder and he simply stood his ground",Munaf Patel to Rohit,FOUR
7374716,MI 1st Inns,14.5,"Dwayne Smith to Pollard, FOUR, goes back to the shortish length and takes the pace off as well, Pollard pulls and is a touch early into the shot, the bottom hand comes off but the ball is in the gap, wide of deep mid-wicket and four more",Dwayne Smith to Pollard,FOUR
7374716,MI 1st Inns,16.4,"Andrew Tye to Pollard, FOUR, a pick up shot and that has almost gone the distance. Angled in on off and middle, Pollard flicks it away powerfully. Roy like McCullum was straight at long-on, he can only pick the ball up from the boundary rope",Andrew Tye to Pollard,FOUR
7374716,MI 1st Inns,18.2,"Andrew Tye to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, streaky, but MI won't mind. The knuckle ball on a fuller length, Hardik had the width to free his arms, throws everything he's got and squirts it off the outside edge behind point, right between backward point and short third man",Andrew Tye to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
7374716,MI 1st Inns,19.1,"P Kumar to Rohit, FOUR, that must surely do it. Praveen looks befuddled. He comes round the wicket and bowls a low full toss on the stumps, Rohit moves across, crouches low, almost on one knee and paddles it fine. With the fielder inside the ring, that was a smart shot",P Kumar to Rohit,FOUR
7374716,MI 1st Inns,3.3,"Munaf Patel to Buttler, FOUR, much needed boundary for MI! Length ball on middle and leg, Buttler moves across and flicks it effortlessly backward of square on the on-side and collects his first boundary",Munaf Patel to Buttler,FOUR
7374716,MI 1st Inns,7.1,"Munaf Patel to Nitish Rana, FOUR, wow! That went like a bullet into the fence. Short and wide outside off, Rana jumps and flashes it hard. The ball flies through the point region and races away",Munaf Patel to Nitish Rana,FOUR

9515142,RCB 1st Inns,15.1,"Stokes to Binny, FOUR, pace on the ball from Stokes and he's been put away. That's not how Thakur and Unadkat were bowling. It skids on nicely from a back of a length for Binny and he flays it through backward point",Stokes to Binny,FOUR
9515142,RCB 1st Inns,15.3,"Stokes to Watson, FOUR, it took 39 balls for RCB to get a boundary. And now they've got two in three. Slower ball banged into the pitch outside off, this time Watson gets stuck into it and slashes it into the extra-cover boundary",Stokes to Watson,FOUR

9515142,RCB 1st Inns,2.0,"SN Thakur to de Villiers, FOUR, what a start from AB! He smokes this off the back foot past backward point. Short and wide from Thakur, and a player of AB's class won't miss out",SN Thakur to de Villiers,FOUR
9515142,RCB 1st Inns,3.2,"SN Thakur to Kohli, FOUR, the edge just eludes a flying Stokes at backward point. Nice and full from Thakur, drawing Kohli across into a drive.

9515142,RCB 1st Inns,4.0,"SN Thakur to Kohli, FOUR, Kohli walks at Thakur who bowls a slower ball on middle and leg. That's Kohli's bread and butter shot. A beautiful wristy flick through mid-wicket fetches him another boundary",SN Thakur to Kohli,FOUR
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,1.1,"Badree to Rahane, FOUR, a full toss. First up. Dictates terms right away does Rahane with a lean forward in whipping it through the on-side. Quite a warm up this",Badree to Rahane,FOUR

9515142,RPS 1st Inns,14.4,"Aravind to Smith, FOUR, a wasted delivery. Well down leg and all Smith has to do with these is get some wood. And he gets a whole chunk on it. Flicks it away off his pads",Aravind to Smith,FOUR
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,15.2,"Watson to Smith, FOUR, a real sitter. Quite a nothing delivery this from Watson. Neither full nor short enough.

9515142,RPS 1st Inns,15.5,"Watson to Dhoni, FOUR, the edges spoil the over. The scrambled leg-cutter this from Watto with a hint of width as well. Dhoni gets his drive around 90-degrees finer than he had planned. Off the outside edge and through the vacant cordon",Watson to Dhoni,FOUR
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,18.1,"Watson to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, a juicy full toss, with generous width dished out as well. Smoked off the middle of the bat sinking onto the front knee as well making it one for the cameras. Pune need a lot more of these",Watson to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR

9515142,RPS 1st Inns,2.1,"Milne to Tripathi, FOUR, right off the screws. A charge down the track in perpendiculars moving down and away in the same motion. All the breathing space for his arms in slicing it with all the power through the covers",Milne to Tripathi,FOUR

9515142,RPS 1st Inns,3.0,"Milne to Rahane, FOUR, make that 17 off the over. After the polite timing, Rahane gets out his violent streak now. Crashes the cut ferociously. Square like a tracer",Milne to Rahane,FOUR
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,3.3,"Aravind to Tripathi, FOUR, width now. Nothing going Bangalore's way. The length isn't either. A friendly sit up and smashed away with a flaying cut. Reintroduced into the fence",Aravind to Tripathi,FOUR
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,4.5,"Watson to Rahane, FOUR, deft. Delicate. Cheeky. The wide slip tactic not quite making much sense now. With Rahane using his surgical precision in bisecting the man out there and the keeper with his delayed steer",Watson to Rahane,FOUR
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,5.0,"Watson to Rahane, FOUR, they're racing through. Brings up the half-ton stand as well. Watto decides to get defensive with a wide dart. Not quite the case with Rahane already stooping low and reaching out in drilling it behind point",Watson to Rahane,FOUR
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,8.0,"Badree to Tripathi, FOUR, bursts through the hands. Badree's. Was a polite drill down this squeezing out the fuller one from Tripathi as he smashes it back. The bowler, slow to get low has a boundary against his name",Badree to Tripathi,FOUR
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,9.3,"Badree to Dhoni, FOUR, threatens to come down. Charge down in fact. All he does in the process is fool Badree into thinking the same and fire one wide. Adjusts and reaches out in slapping it behind point. A confidence boosting boundary",Badree to Dhoni,FOUR
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,9.5,"Badree to Dhoni, FOUR, the punches are out. A wide, short combo this and dealt with a certain degree of aplomb. Shows the leather the full face of the blade and crashes it through backward point",Badree to Dhoni,FOUR

The quick outfield does the rest",Woakes to Samson,FOUR
2969824,DC 1st Inns,10.0,"de Grandhomme to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, beautiful shot. With mid-off up inside the circle, de Grandhomme pitches it up outside off. Iyer spots it and caresses the drive. It was uppish, but in the gap. 12 runs off the tenth over",de Grandhomme to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR

2969824,DC 1st Inns,2.1,"U Yadav to Billings, FOUR, starts with a leg-stump half-volley and gets the treatment it deserves. Billings leans forward and whips it through mid-wicket and the ball bullets away. No need to run for shots like that",U Yadav to Billings,FOUR

2969824,DC 1st Inns,8.5,"Woakes to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, that's harsh on the bowler. That didn't deserve to go to the boundary. It was banged in short and Woakes bent his back there. Iyer is surprised by the pace and bounce on that delivery. He jumps and just sticks his bat out hoping that it doesn't hit him. The ball flies past the keeper off his shoulder and dribbles away into the third man fence. The umpire thinks it came off the bat and gives four runs",Woakes to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2969824,DC 1st Inns,9.1,"de Grandhomme to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, welcome to Delhi says Iyer. Shortish and wide outside off, Iyer treks back and fiercely cuts it behind square on the off-side. Gets it well out of the reach of backward point",de Grandhomme to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,1.2,"Pat Cummins to Gambhir, FOUR, that's a gift and Gambhir accepts it gleefully. Half-volley on off-stump, Gambhir takes it from there and flicks it fiercely past mid-on. Rockets away to the fence",Pat Cummins to Gambhir,FOUR
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,1.3,"Pat Cummins to Gambhir, FOUR, too full and too easy. Wafted full outside off, Gambhir leans forward, presents a nice high elbow and creams it past mid-off",Pat Cummins to Gambhir,FOUR

2969824,KKR 1st Inns,10.0,"Shami to M Pandey, FOUR, this is intentional stuff from Pandey. Waits in his crease till the last instant, opens the bat face and runs it through the vacant slip region",Shami to M Pandey,FOUR
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,14.0,"Zaheer to M Pandey, FOUR, 15 off the over and Zaheer isn't happy. Probably with himself. After serving all those full tosses, he drifts one down leg. Pandey moves across and gets a faint tickle. No chance for Pant who put in a desperate dive. The ball dribbles away into the fence",Zaheer to M Pandey,FOUR
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,14.4,"Chris Morris to Y Pathan, FOUR, this is a gift and Pathan collects it with both hands. Full toss down leg, Pathan gets enough wood on his wild bat-swing and gets it very fine",Chris Morris to Y Pathan,FOUR
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,15.0,"Chris Morris to M Pandey, FOUR, cheeky shot! Full and on off, Pandey opens his bat face at the last instant and steers it between the keeper and short third man. 10 runs off the wicket, in spite of Pathan's wicket",Chris Morris to M Pandey,FOUR
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,3.3,"Chris Morris to Y Pathan, FOUR, elegance written all over it. So flowy and effortless from Pathan. Like a liquid. A fuller length delivery in the slot, Pathan stands motionless and lifts it straight over the bowler's head. Holds the pose for the cameras after playing the shot",Chris Morris to Y Pathan,FOUR
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,4.2,"Zaheer to Y Pathan, FOUR, that's a stinker and gets punished. Shortens his length but sprays it on leg-stump line. Pathan rolls his wrists and directs it past the man at 45",Zaheer to Y Pathan,FOUR
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,5.2,"Pat Cummins to Y Pathan, FOUR, wow. That's a ripper from Cummins. Came out of nowwhere. Bangs it short, rears up viciously.

2969824,KKR 1st Inns,5.3,"Pat Cummins to Y Pathan, FOUR, no half measures this time. Rocks back and butchers it over mid-on. Couple of bounces and into the fence",Pat Cummins to Y Pathan,FOUR

2969824,KKR 1st Inns,9.0,"Mishra to Y Pathan, FOUR, didn't get it where he intended but still earns himself a boundary.

9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell, FOUR, four first ball for Maxwell who has promoted himself to No. 3. Full on leg-stump, the ball is ducking in sharply and Maxwell just about gets some bat on it to help it along while yanking his leg away",Bhuvneshwar to Maxwell,FOUR
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,1.1,"Barinder to Vohra, FOUR, lots of width from Sran and Vohra lashes him over cover-point. He had no intentions of keeping it along the ground, which is the way to go when you're going hard at it. Even if an edge is found, it will fly",Barinder to Vohra,FOUR
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,1.4,"Barinder to Maxwell, FOUR, right up under Maxwell's bat and he punches it fiercely over mid-on. A full ball on leg-stump, Maxwell opens his stance up, gets his front leg out of the way and times it nicely",Barinder to Maxwell,FOUR
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,12.5,"Nabi to Vohra, FOUR, too many deliveries on the shorter side in this over and Vohra finally gets hold of one. He rocks back and pulls it away wide of long-on",Nabi to Vohra,FOUR
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,13.0,"Nabi to Vohra, FOUR, almost an action replay of the previous shot. An ordinary over from Nabi to complete what has been a fine spell. Short again, Vohra belts it in the same place on the field",Nabi to Vohra,FOUR
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,14.4,"Barinder to Vohra, FOUR, what an over this is turning out to be! 18 already with 2 balls to go.

Warner isn't happy",Barinder to Vohra,FOUR
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,15.2,"Rashid Khan to Vohra, FOUR, the bowler is under pressure too here. Even someone as confident as Rashid. He drops it short, allows Vohra to rock back and he belts it over square leg. Bounces just inside the ropes",Rashid Khan to Vohra,FOUR
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,16.0,"Rashid Khan to Vohra, FOUR, massive over. 21 off it. Rashid errs down leg, sits up for Vohra on the hips and he whips it away past short fine leg. He beats deep backward square too",Rashid Khan to Vohra,FOUR
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,16.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Vohra, FOUR, Vohra keeps going. He's batting on another planet out there. The timing off his bat, magnificent. This is a full toss in all fairness, Vohra is deep in the crease, he uses the pace and slices it away through point",Bhuvneshwar to Vohra,FOUR
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,5.4,"Rashid Khan to Vohra, FOUR, spots the googly out of the hand and lofts it over mid-off. The line was a bit too wide of off which was a giveaway too. A good forward stride from Vohra before hitting through the line",Rashid Khan to Vohra,FOUR
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,6.0,"Rashid Khan to Vohra, FOUR, he's nailed that extra-cover drive too. Rashid under the pump for the first time this season. A little shimmy down the pitch to get close to the pitch and drills it with the turn",Rashid Khan to Vohra,FOUR
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,10.1,"Cariappa to Naman Ojha, FOUR, sinks on the sweep. Barely gets himself in control of it. The stride doesn't even get close enough to the pitch of the delivery as he top-edges it in the end. Has a boundary to his name with the man charging in from fine leg sacrificing some runs in the quest of looking to take the catch",Cariappa to Naman Ojha,FOUR
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,10.3,"Cariappa to Warner, FOUR, the usual trick. But conventional this time. Sweeps with all his muscle and his big bat has it in it to almost take it all the way over",Cariappa to Warner,FOUR
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,12.0,"Axar to Naman Ojha, FOUR, the line-looser. Ends up with a freebie going down leg and all he does it get some of his swat on it to take it past the keeper. That's all he had to do. A graceful acceptance",Axar to Naman Ojha,FOUR
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,12.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Warner, FOUR, cheeky. Deft too in equal proportion. Moves away, manufactures room and opens his bat face ever so late in guiding it very fine",Sandeep Sharma to Warner,FOUR
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,14.2,"Ishant to Warner, FOUR, a juicy full toss. Had to be dispatched. It sure was. But almost laterally opposite to where he was looking for. Tries punching it through the covers, gets it a lot more of the edge than he would have liked and gets it through the cordon. The half-ton of the stand comes up",Ishant to Warner,FOUR
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,16.2,"Mohit Sharma to Warner, FOUR, the loss of radar. Five consecutive half-centuries for Warner against Punjab. Has to be the most difficult one. Certainly the slowest.

9296666,SRH 1st Inns,17.5,"Axar to Deepak Hooda, FOUR, clears the front leg, adopts the line and then reintroduces the ball into the fence. After quite some time. Much needed this for the crowd to find their lost voice back. Sinks and lofts the drive through the line",Axar to Deepak Hooda,FOUR
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,18.2,"Mohit Sharma to Warner, FOUR, moves all around in his crease. Then sits. And turns right handed. Mohit meanwhile fires in a low full toss. Only to watch it be slogged through the tiny gap in the cover fortress",Mohit Sharma to Warner,FOUR

9296666,SRH 1st Inns,2.2,"Sandeep Sharma to Dhawan, FOUR, just the ideal sitting up length. Bangs it in but the pitch just doesn't allow the ball to do anything cheeky. Right in the slot and swatted away flat batted through backward square",Sandeep Sharma to Dhawan,FOUR
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,6.4,"Cariappa to Warner, FOUR, nails the reverse. Switches grips, turns around, sits down and creams the broom behind square. A whistler this",Cariappa to Warner,FOUR
5231444,GL 1st Inns,12.4,"Milne to Jadeja, FOUR, what's those feet for? Stays put, just lumbers up and uses the width on this short ball to slice the cut uppishly through backward point. Placed it delicately behind the fielder",Milne to Jadeja,FOUR
5231444,GL 1st Inns,13.2,"Watson to Jadeja, FOUR, the line was quite similar again. Angled across tight on off-stump but Jadeja goes for the pull this time. Was prepared on the back foot and swatted it away round the corner, with a deliciously awkward swivel",Watson to Jadeja,FOUR
5231444,GL 1st Inns,18.1,"Aravind to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, Kohli drops a tough chance here, now, now, he better not hurt his shoulder here. That right one is still sore, we all know.

5231444,GL 1st Inns,3.0,"Aravind to Raina, FOUR, he's turning it on. Makes it 19 off the over courtesy a walk down and a clip off his legs. Another loss in the radar here from Aravind darting it down leg. Raina's ain't complaining though. Just strolls and piles on the misery with a wristy airy flick in front of square",Aravind to Raina,FOUR
5231444,GL 1st Inns,3.3,"Chahal to Raina, FOUR, the slogs continue. This time off Raina's bat. Walks himself into the line, sees the defensive trajectory on the pads and just whips it off an angled blade. A bounce into the fence behind square",Chahal to Raina,FOUR
5231444,GL 1st Inns,4.2,"Negi to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, a nothing length this. Too short. Sitting up nicely on the bat. And plundered back into the mid-wicket fence with a flat batted opened up pull",Negi to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
5231444,GL 1st Inns,6.4,"Milne to Finch, FOUR, a real sitter. Tries the surprise slower one dishing this one out at 117kph and just a tickle off the bottom of Finch's wood on the pull is enough to take it into the gap behind square and past the reach of the man running across",Milne to Finch,FOUR
5231444,GL 1st Inns,8.2,"Milne to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, a full toss now. With all the men inside the circle at mid-off, even a miscue catching the toe-end of the bat in the extravagant drive means a boundary",Milne to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
5231444,GL 1st Inns,9.0,"Milne to Finch, FOUR, the leakage goes up to 17. Milne keeps digging it short, the pitch doesn't get it up and Finch keeps raking in the boundaries.

5231444,RCB 1st Inns,0.5,"D Kulkarni to Kohli, FOUR, was that intentional from Kohli? I don't think so. Where's the slip.

5231444,RCB 1st Inns,1.5,"Basil Thampi to Kohli, FOUR, 143kph sharp bouncer that hurries onto the batsman. Kohli persists with his pull shot and gets a top edge that goes over the short fine leg fielder's head. Unfair for the bowler",Basil Thampi to Kohli,FOUR
5231444,RCB 1st Inns,11.3,"D Kulkarni to Gayle, FOUR, streaky but Gayle won't mind one bit. Throws his bat at this off-pace delivery, gets a thickish outside edge that flies past a diving short third man. Ishan Kishan was the fielder who dived to his right but to no avail",D Kulkarni to Gayle,FOUR
5231444,RCB 1st Inns,11.5,"D Kulkarni to Gayle, FOUR, Gayle is putting on a show here. Shows finesse this time, opens the bat face to this off-cutter outside off and steers it past point. Races away to the fence",D Kulkarni to Gayle,FOUR
5231444,RCB 1st Inns,13.4,"Jadeja to Kohli, FOUR, abandons the niceties of 1s and 2s and unfurls his strong bottom hand here. Leans forward, extends his hands and cracks the drive through extra cover. Fielder in the deep gave a chase but in vain. Sublime!",Jadeja to Kohli,FOUR
5231444,RCB 1st Inns,16.1,"Andrew Tye to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, how cheeky from Jadhav? Sees the full ball outside off, waits in his crease and lets his hands take over. Opens his bat face and dinks it in the pocket between short third man and point",Andrew Tye to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
5231444,RCB 1st Inns,17.1,"Basil Thampi to Head, FOUR, too predictable. The slower ones, I meant. This was on shortish length outside off, Head deals it with alacrity, fetches the pull from outside off and nails it in front of square",Basil Thampi to Head,FOUR

5231444,RCB 1st Inns,19.3,"Jadeja to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, 200-up for RCB. Magnificent shot from Jadhav. Engineers room by backing away to leg and lifts it over cover-point. The ball has enough legs to reach the fence",Jadeja to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
5231444,RCB 1st Inns,19.5,"Jadeja to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, goes the round-armish way but dishes out it outside off, Jadhav lunges across and lofts it over cover. Sort of played a short-arm jab there",Jadeja to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR

5231444,RCB 1st Inns,5.2,"Jadeja to Gayle, FOUR, fired in quick outside off, lots of width on offer. Gayle treks back and punishes it with a punch. The mid-off fielder dived and got a hand to it. But the power off Gayle's bat ensured it crossed the rope",Jadeja to Gayle,FOUR

3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,1.4,"McClenaghan to Amla, FOUR, was that another chance? Looked like Nitish Rana got a fingertip to it and would be called a dropped chance. Fullish and angled across outside off stump, Amla squre-drives on the rise, the man at backward point moved to his left and tried to reverse-cup the ball but couldn't hold on",McClenaghan to Amla,FOUR
3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,11.1,"Malinga to Amla, FOUR, slower ball, Amla shows his class. Shuffles forward and towards the delivery and opens the bat face to slice it behind point. Pure timing",Malinga to Amla,FOUR
3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,11.4,"Malinga to Amla, FOUR, just a mere extension of the punch. Played it with leaden-feet and timed it to perfection, waited for the full ball to dip and graced it with touch of elegance. Back over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four",Malinga to Amla,FOUR
3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,12.1,"Krunal Pandya to Amla, FOUR, cuts and cuts well does Hashim Amla. Stays deep inside the crease and rotates his wrists through a fierce cut, beating a diving backward point to his right",Krunal Pandya to Amla,FOUR

3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,13.5,"Bumrah to Maxwell, FOUR, that's brutalized behind square on the off-side. That bouncer might have just woken him up. Clears his front leg, waits for the length ball to arrive and smashes it with the amount of power only MAXI can generate. Those Popeye arms..woof!",Bumrah to Maxwell,FOUR
3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,14.3,"McClenaghan to Maxwell, FOUR, emergency, emergency! The bowlers are being thrashed, someone send an ambulance. Maxi is putting up a clinic. This is some batting. McClenaghan bowls it straight, marmalized wide of long-on",McClenaghan to Maxwell,FOUR

3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,18.0,"McClenaghan to Amla, FOUR, room on offer and Amla uses it to great effect. Carves the short ball over point giving no chance for sweeper cover to cut it off. Amla on fire, just 17 away from the triple treat",McClenaghan to Amla,FOUR
3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,18.4,"Bumrah to Amla, FOUR, across his stumps and way she goes into the fine leg fence. Sweetly timed, Bumrah has no clue. Amla walked a long way across and helped the full delivery with a real tap of the bat. Flew!",Bumrah to Amla,FOUR
3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,2.3,"Hardik Pandya to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, that's an excellent shot from Marsh. Shortish and rising high, Marsh stood tall and cut it away over point, didn't bother to keep the ball down and it raced to the fence in no time",Hardik Pandya to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,2.4,"Hardik Pandya to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, this time he cuts along the ground, the length wasn't all that shorter compared to the previous ball, Marsh timed that shot sweetly as well and pierced the gap between cover-point and cover",Hardik Pandya to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,3.3,"Harbhajan to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, that's asking for trouble. Short and way outside off stump, the arm-ball gone wrong, maybe the newish ball slipped out of his hands, Marsh had to reach out and he cut that fiercely past point",Harbhajan to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,5.4,"McClenaghan to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, the slower ball doesn't stick on the surface and sits up nicely for Marsh to thrash that away for four with a pull shot. Hit with some power and the man in the deep had no chance",McClenaghan to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,1.2,"Ishant to Buttler, FOUR, steers the ball through point for four. Good length ball outside off, Buttler's feet don't move a lot as he opens the bat-face and guides the ball in the gap. The timing stands out again",Ishant to Buttler,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,1.4,"Ishant to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, stand and admire! That's a scorching drive. Wow. That's not a half-volley, not even close. But Parthiv still manages to blaze it away on the up. He hit that uppishly but found the gap",Ishant to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,14.5,"Ishant to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, a low full toss. Ishant well and truly on his way to some unwanted bowling figures tonight. Pandya meanwhile just about clears his front leg and slices it past a tired extra cover at the fence. Spare a thought",Ishant to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,15.0,"Ishant to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, and again. Ishant has 58 against his name. A full delivery hoping to veer into the blockhole and Pandya digs it out with the bat gaining all the momentum to be imparted with a smash past the bowler. Long-off doesn't even want to take the effort in chasing this. Futile I tell you",Ishant to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,2.2,"Sandeep Sharma to Buttler, FOUR, with the keeper up, Buttler doesn't give the charge. What he does is back away to make room and laces a drive off the stumps through extra-cover. Sandeep had overpitched there and gets drilled to the boundary",Sandeep Sharma to Buttler,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,3.3,"Ishant to Buttler, FOUR, oh dear, is Miller okay? That burst through his hands and hit him on the head. Luckily, it looks like just a glancing blow. The good length ball was hit ferociously by Buttler and it flew towards extra-cover. Would have taken some catching but Miller would normally back himself",Ishant to Buttler,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,3.5,"Ishant to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, wrong lines from Ishant, and Parthiv will pick him away from there all day everday. Fullish on the pads, he's been flicked away behind square",Ishant to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,4.1,"Mohit Sharma to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, there's no stopping the boundaries. Mohit bangs it in first ball and he's been ramped over the keeper's head. What a start for Mumbai. They're absolutely flying",Mohit Sharma to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,4.3,"Mohit Sharma to Buttler, FOUR, picks the slower ball and thumps it through extra-cover. Carnage in Indore. It was a back of length off-cutter and somehow Buttler managed to infuse enough power on the drive off the back foot",Mohit Sharma to Buttler,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,4.5,"Mohit Sharma to Buttler, FOUR, drifts into the pads, and with fine leg up, that's asking for punishment. Buttler duly puts him away to the boundary. Good wristwork",Mohit Sharma to Buttler,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,5.0,"Mohit Sharma to Buttler, FOUR, 17 off the first over from Mohit. I think Maxwell will have to turn to spin. His pacers are disappearing. Slower ball outside off, it's full and in the slot, and Buttler nails him through extra-cover again",Mohit Sharma to Buttler,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,5.2,"Stoinis to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, that's a sizzler! He's absolutely scythed that through point. A little bit of width from Stoinis, Parthiv adds to it by making some room and slashes it away",Stoinis to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
3632467,MI 1st Inns,7.5,"Stoinis to Buttler, FOUR, sliced in the air, the bat turned on impact there. But Buttler will still get four. He can't do much wrong tonight.

9478272,GL 1st Inns,0.3,"Shakib to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, McCullum is underway! Shakib fires it in full on middle, McCullum drills it down the ground. The umpire has to duck under it to evade that. The ball races away into the fence",Shakib to Brendon McCullum,FOUR

9478272,GL 1st Inns,10.5,"Narine to Raina, FOUR, is quick to jummp onto the back foot, gets inside the line of the flatter delivery and thumps it with a clean swing of the willow. A boundary behind square on the leg-side",Narine to Raina,FOUR
9478272,GL 1st Inns,11.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Raina, FOUR, deft! Raina camps deep inside the crease and steers the ball with softest of touches as he opens the bat face at the right moment. Needed a dive from Narine at short third man, he is just lazing around",Kuldeep Yadav to Raina,FOUR
9478272,GL 1st Inns,11.5,"Kuldeep Yadav to Dwayne Smith, FOUR. No sighters. Walk in and get a boundary. As simple as that. Slog-sweeps from outside off and boy! The ball flies away",Kuldeep Yadav to Dwayne Smith,FOUR
9478272,GL 1st Inns,13.5,"Kuldeep Yadav to Raina, FOUR, just a slice of inside edge and through. It skids straight on and nicks the edge before racing past the leg-stump. Tough for Robbie to pick",Kuldeep Yadav to Raina,FOUR
9478272,GL 1st Inns,14.5,"U Yadav to Raina, FOUR, there's the width which Raina has been eyeing. It's on the shorter side too, and Raina is able to lash it away past backward point. Beats third man to the boundary",U Yadav to Raina,FOUR
9478272,GL 1st Inns,16.1,"Coulter-Nile to Raina, FOUR, length ball outside off, Raina moves leg-side and slaps it straight back past the bowler. Mid-off was up inside the ring, and Raina is able to slot it to his left",Coulter-Nile to Raina,FOUR
9478272,GL 1st Inns,16.3,"Coulter-Nile to Raina, FOUR, he's winning it for his team. Makes some room and nearly slices this overpitched delivery from off-stump. The placement is spot on, so is the timing as he nails this past backward point",Coulter-Nile to Raina,FOUR
9478272,GL 1st Inns,18.2,"Coulter-Nile to Jadeja, FOUR, Jadeja seals it with a boundary! Short from Coulter-Nile, enough width for Jadeja to slap it past backward point. Superb chase from the Gujarat Lions to hopefully provide a boost to their turbulent campaign",Coulter-Nile to Jadeja,FOUR

9478272,GL 1st Inns,3.4,"Coulter-Nile to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, that came right off the middle of the bat. Angling in short of length delivery, McCullum jogs down and leg-side-ish to cut it behind a diving backward point. No chance whatsoever for third man",Coulter-Nile to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
9478272,GL 1st Inns,4.0,"Coulter-Nile to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, 16 off the fourth over. Superb adjustment. Seeing McCullum jogging down, Coulter-Nile darts it outside off, McCullum spots it slices it backward of point. One bounce into the fence",Coulter-Nile to Brendon McCullum,FOUR

9478272,GL 1st Inns,8.1,"Woakes to Raina, FOUR, quintessential Suresh Raina inside-out loft over extra cover. Anyone surprised? He does this so often and that too off the first ball of the over. Makes room and goes bang off the middle",Woakes to Raina,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,0.2,"P Kumar to Narine, FOUR, that's Daren Sammy alike from Sunil Narine. The former is very good with his whip without moving his feet much and Narine has emulated him. The line is straight on the stumps from PK, Narine stands and flicks stylishly over backward square leg and beats the man at fine leg",P Kumar to Narine,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,0.5,"P Kumar to Narine, FOUR, now that's some response from Narine. He knows that the outswinger is troubling him, steps down the pitch and forces the bowler to drop it short, which will not allow the ball to swing, and then he goes back over the bowler's head for a boundary",P Kumar to Narine,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,1.0,"P Kumar to Narine, FOUR, he's doing it nicely, Sunil Narine! Just what Gambhir and Co. wanted with the promotion. PK bowls short of length and just outside off stump, Narine waits for the ball to come and hits through the line over mid-on",P Kumar to Narine,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,1.2,"Faulkner to Narine, FOUR, Faulkner sports an ""Ooohhhh,"" with a wry smile on his face. This wasn't a bad delivery. Full and swinging away outside off stump, Narine drives without moving his feet, sends it to the right of mid-off and it races away",Faulkner to Narine,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,1.4,"Faulkner to Narine, FOUR, that's edged and no one at slip. Faulkner delivers one outside off stump, Narine goes hard at it and gets a thick edge that escapes past the keeper",Faulkner to Narine,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,1.5,"Faulkner to Narine, FOUR, off the back foot and over mid-off. This is great exhibition of batting from the West Indian. Short of a length just outside off stump, Narine lofts nicely from the middle of the bat and collects his sixth boundary",Faulkner to Narine,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,10.4,"D Kulkarni to Uthappa, FOUR, deft, delicate and effective. The off-cutter outside off, Uthappa waited for the ball to arrive, cut it late and pierced short third man and backward point to perfection. He couldn't have played that better",D Kulkarni to Uthappa,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,11.1,"Faulkner to Uthappa, FOUR, the idea was to steer it to third man, but Uthappa got it finer than he would have liked. Slower delivery angled across the batsman, Uthappa gets an edge that eludes Karthik to his right. Should he have gone for the catch? Tough one to call",Faulkner to Uthappa,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,13.3,"Faulkner to M Pandey, FOUR, that was just a nudge and the lightning fast Kolkata outfield does the rest. Short of length and on the batsman's hips, Pandey backed away and twirled his wrists to place it wide of short fine leg, once in the gap it was a boundary",Faulkner to M Pandey,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,14.4,"Jadeja to Uthappa, FOUR, uses the pace of Jadeja and collects a boundary. Pushed through just outside off, Uthappa waits and steers it fine. Once past the 30-yard circle, there's no stopping that",Jadeja to Uthappa,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,14.5,"Jadeja to Uthappa, FOUR, fifty for Uthappa. Second for him this season. Gets there with a cheeky little scoop. Expects Jadeja to target the stumps, shuffles across and gets low, then laps it over Karthik to bring up the milestone",Jadeja to Uthappa,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,15.3,"Basil Thampi to Uthappa, FOUR, that might be the commentators curse. Thampi missed the yorker by a few yards, low full toss on middle, Uthappa flicks it to the fine leg fence. The fast outfield on display again",Basil Thampi to Uthappa,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,17.1,"Basil Thampi to Uthappa, FOUR, the ball hits the turf and zips off. McCullum had a few yards to cover and he couldn't get there. Very full and just outside off, Uthappa lofts it wide of long-off, one bounce four",Basil Thampi to Uthappa,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,18.5,"P Kumar to Y Pathan, FOUR, top shot! PK missed his yorker by a couple of inches and that was enough for Pathan, he opened the bat face on the loft and placed it wide of long-off. The opening of the bat was important to get the placement right",P Kumar to Y Pathan,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,19.0,"P Kumar to Y Pathan, FOUR, last two balls ruins the over for PK. It was turning out to be a good over until then. Full toss on middle and leg, Pathan whips it square and there's no protection in the deep, 12 off the over",P Kumar to Y Pathan,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,19.2,"Basil Thampi to M Pandey, FOUR, full toss and Pandey cashes in. He stands deep in the crease and slices the drive square on the off-side, sweeper had no chance of cutting that off",Basil Thampi to M Pandey,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,2.0,"Faulkner to Narine, FOUR, he's only dealing in boundaries. Faulkner tried the change of pace to fox the batsman, but it went too full and landed right in the slot for Narine to drive, credit to Narine for delaying the shot to get the timing right and hit it well wide of the man at long-off",Faulkner to Narine,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Basil Thampi to Narine, FOUR, this is almost predictable. Basil Thampi has the pace to trouble Narine, so one could see the bouncer coming. Narine was already backing away before the bowler delivered the ball and easily managed to pull it over mid-on",Basil Thampi to Narine,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,2.4,"Basil Thampi to Narine, FOUR, the idea was right from Basil Thampi - to opt for a fuller one as follow up for the bumper - the execution was poor. It's a full toss and Narine slices the drive over cover-point",Basil Thampi to Narine,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,4.1,"D Kulkarni to Uthappa, FOUR, that's a gift from Kulkarni. Short of a length delivery down the leg-side, Uthappa flicks, the outfield is fast, the ball races through backward square leg and fine leg had no chance",D Kulkarni to Uthappa,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,4.4,"D Kulkarni to Gambhir, FOUR, that's too wide and Gambhir is a very good off-side player. Reaches out to meet the ball, was on a fuller length, creamed through cover from the middle of the bat",D Kulkarni to Gambhir,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"Raina to Uthappa, FOUR, very straight, Uthappa kneels down and pulls it along the ground through square leg, no protection in the deep. Looked like the ball came off the inside half of the bat",Raina to Uthappa,FOUR
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,9.2,"Dwayne Smith to Gambhir, 4 runs, oh dear, Jadeja misses the stumps and it's gone for four overthrows. A direct-hit would have seen Gambhir walk back though. It looked very interesting when he chose the striker's end, despite Uthappa being halfway down the pitch. Should have been a dot ball, but it's four runs now. Gambhir tapped this to point and thought about a run, took a couple of steps out of the crease, his partner was charging towards the other end, but Gambhir sent him back. All well in the end for KKR",Dwayne Smith to Gambhir,FOUR

3657322,RPS 1st Inns,15.0,"S Kaul to Stokes, FOUR, carves it beautifully over extra-cover. Kaul slanted it away outside off and Stokes used the angle to his advantage. It looked like he got it close to the bottom of the bat but it still flies away",S Kaul to Stokes,FOUR
3657322,RPS 1st Inns,17.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, questions are bound to be raised over Tiwary's batting position. To my mind at least, he's been in stunning form of late.

3657322,RPS 1st Inns,17.2,"Siraj to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, walks across towards off and effortlessly picks it away over backward square leg. Brilliantly timed yet again. Fine leg was up inside the ring and Tiwary picked his spot",Siraj to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR
3657322,RPS 1st Inns,17.5,"Siraj to Dhoni, FOUR, he's getting into his stride now. An upper-cut over backward point for four. Siraj goes short outside off, it's not a very safe delivery with third man up. It's not a safe delivery at all.

3657322,RPS 1st Inns,18.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Dhoni, FOUR, gets it between his own legs and gets it for four. So unfortunate for Bhuvneshwar. It's a cracking delivery this.

3657322,SRH 1st Inns,19.2,"SN Thakur to Deepak Hooda, FOUR, cheeky and four, this was slower bouncer from Thakur. Hooda waits on it and ramps it over Dhoni's head, third man was inside the ring and the ball rolls away to the fence",SN Thakur to Deepak Hooda,FOUR
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,19.4,"SN Thakur to Henriques, FOUR, nicely bowled but even better played by Henriques, raises his fifty as well. Thakur saw Henriques backing away, followed him with a full ball. Henriques makes room, plays with an open face and drives it through cover, no need to run for those",SN Thakur to Henriques,FOUR
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,19.5,"SN Thakur to Henriques, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Henriques, this was full and on the stumps, Henriques was backing away, plays with an open face and finds the gap behind square on the off-side, no one moved",SN Thakur to Henriques,FOUR
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,2.5,"Unadkat to Dhawan, FOUR, presses forward causing the bowler to shorten his length, quickly transfers his weight onto the back foot and spanks the pull through mid-wicket. Unadkat didn't get a lot of height with that and it sat up",Unadkat to Dhawan,FOUR
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,4.0,"Washington Sundar to Dhawan, FOUR, this time he goes fuller, and a little bit wider outside off, and allows Dhawan the room to free his arms. He's quickly onto the back knee to sweep it away through mid-wicket",Washington Sundar to Dhawan,FOUR
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,4.2,"Stokes to Dhawan, FOUR, Dhawan seems to have gained tremendously from his fifty the other day. He's playing with a good amount of confidence and fluency. Back of a length outside off, he punches it away with flair past backward point",Stokes to Dhawan,FOUR
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,5.4,"SN Thakur to Warner, FOUR, doesn't nail the timing again but he's hit it with enough power to beat mid-on to his right. A full ball slanted in on off, Warner shovels it away down the ground with a lot of bottom hand",SN Thakur to Warner,FOUR
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,6.0,"SN Thakur to Warner, FOUR, rather than using a horizontal bat this time, he just steers this past short third man and into the boundary. It was a slower ball from Thakur so wasn't a lot of pace to work with. But the timing is exquisite from Warner",SN Thakur to Warner,FOUR
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,6.4,"Washington Sundar to Dhawan, FOUR, that's such a good shot and so difficult to do against Sundar. He's able to gallop down to the pitch of the ball to lift it back over the bowler's head. Really well played",Washington Sundar to Dhawan,FOUR
1169775,DC 1st Inns,0.5,"Johnson to Samson, FOUR, crunched! Johnson pounds it short of length around off, Samson stands tall and punches it through the crowded off-side field, the ball races away to the fence",Johnson to Samson,FOUR
1169775,DC 1st Inns,1.0,"Johnson to Samson, FOUR, consecutive boundaries to finish an eventful first over. Too straight, on middle and leg, Samson flicks it off his pads past the square leg umpire, the quick outfield does the rest",Johnson to Samson,FOUR
1169775,DC 1st Inns,1.5,"McClenaghan to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, poor delivery and Iyer is off the mark. Slips it onto the legs, just needed a tickle and Iyer got plenty of wood on that, the ball raced away to the fine leg fence",McClenaghan to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
1169775,DC 1st Inns,10.3,"Bumrah to Rabada, FOUR, chipped up. Was a serious miscue. But pockets a boundary for his efforts. With no one at the fence, thanks to all the wickets falling around, Rabada lofts it uppishly off the cue end over mid-off. That's all he had to do",Bumrah to Rabada,FOUR
1169775,DC 1st Inns,10.4,"Bumrah to Rabada, FOUR, the French cut now. Rabada keeping the flag fluttering up there. Gets himself too close for the cut but swishes through. Chops it off the under edge past the keeper. So very French",Bumrah to Rabada,FOUR
1169775,DC 1st Inns,12.3,"Johnson to Chris Morris, FOUR, brings up the 50 of the stand. A real fightback this. And gets there in some style as well with a lovely looking square cut. Guess what, there is no one out there",Johnson to Chris Morris,FOUR
1169775,DC 1st Inns,14.4,"Krunal Pandya to Chris Morris, FOUR, brilliance to end in some sloppiness. A punishing drive this from Morris through the covers and the other KP runs around, swoops and dives to cut off what was meant to be a certain boundary. But in his attempt to get up and throw has his back leg spike brush the boundary cushions. Oh dear, the misery gets worse",Krunal Pandya to Chris Morris,FOUR
1169775,DC 1st Inns,17.3,"McClenaghan to Chris Morris, FOUR, here comes the streak. Morris gives it his all, just throws his bat out at a short, wide pepper. Only manages a top-edge. More than enough to fly through the cordon",McClenaghan to Chris Morris,FOUR
1169775,DC 1st Inns,19.2,"Hardik Pandya to Chris Morris, FOUR, keeps them in the hunt. Gets low on a knee and throws the bat out in carving it square. In the gap too. 19 needed off 4",Hardik Pandya to Chris Morris,FOUR
1169775,DC 1st Inns,8.0,"Harbhajan to Rabada, FOUR, almost another. Rabada after getting squared up thanks to the nagging angle being created out here just throws his bat up looking to cut the ball away. Races away off the top-edge and flies through the hands of slip. Rohit the man out there. Too quick for the classification to come under a drop",Harbhajan to Rabada,FOUR
1169775,DC 1st Inns,8.4,"Hardik Pandya to Rabada, FOUR, oh glorious. As clean as it could get. A pitched up delivery in the arc and Rabada gives his top order a facepalm moment with a full bat face presentation. Whizzes past the bowler",Hardik Pandya to Rabada,FOUR
1169775,DC 1st Inns,9.1,"Harbhajan to Chris Morris, FOUR, would need many more of these. A wide liner this from Bhajji and Morris capitalizes with a reverse as he brooms it past the lone man perched at point",Harbhajan to Chris Morris,FOUR
1169775,MI 1st Inns,1.5,"Chris Morris to Buttler, FOUR. Edged. One-bounce. Four. The fluke pays off. Buttler comes dancing down the track and slices the flash-drive off the outside edge. Raced away!",Chris Morris to Buttler,FOUR
1169775,MI 1st Inns,11.2,"Zaheer to Krunal Pandya, FOUR. No pace. Krunal Pandya picked the bones out it. Shuffles towards the line of the ball and smears it in the gap between mid-off and extra cover",Zaheer to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
1169775,MI 1st Inns,13.1,"Zaheer to Pollard, FOUR, fine delivery that didn't deserve a boundary. Short delivery right under the batsman's throat, Pollard was backing away and was hurried on the pull, the top-edge flies away fine, one bounce and into the fence",Zaheer to Pollard,FOUR
1169775,MI 1st Inns,14.0,"Zaheer to Pollard, FOUR, second boundary of the over for Pollard. He holds the key for MI. Zaheer goes full and Pollard says thank you very much, drilled down the ground past mid-off. That ends Zaheer's spell, 4-0-36-0. He's still searching for his 100th IPL wicket",Zaheer to Pollard,FOUR
1169775,MI 1st Inns,14.2,"Mishra to Pollard, FOUR, smashed! The crowd are slowly finding their voices again. Flighted just outside off, Pollard drives it down the ground. How hard did he strike that? He didn't bother to run, that sums it up",Mishra to Pollard,FOUR
1169775,MI 1st Inns,15.1,"Pat Cummins to Pollard, FOUR, would you believe it? Morris allows the ball to escape past him. Has his hands up to apologise to Cummins. Short delivery and Pollard pulls it without much timing. Morris was reluctant to come for the catch. Tries to take it on the bounce, but the side spins beats him",Pat Cummins to Pollard,FOUR
1169775,MI 1st Inns,19.4,"Chris Morris to Johnson, FOUR, streaky! But Johnson won't mind. He's off the mark in this IPL with a boundary. Very full and on leg-stump, Johnson slogs and the inside edge evades the leg-stump, runs away to the fine leg fence",Chris Morris to Johnson,FOUR
1169775,MI 1st Inns,2.1,"Zaheer to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, pure timing. Just put bat to ball and the timing will take care of the rest. The thing that coaches tell you. PP did just that to a leg-side dart, dances away to the mid-wicket fence beating a desperate dive from one of the fielders",Zaheer to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
1169775,MI 1st Inns,4.3,"Zaheer to Buttler, FOUR. Help-me please. Leg-side fodder, Buttler tickles it fine",Zaheer to Buttler,FOUR
1169775,MI 1st Inns,5.0,"Zaheer to Buttler, FOUR. Right into his plate. Sits up perfectly for Buttler, he lifts it with lovely extension of the arms over extra cover",Zaheer to Buttler,FOUR
1169775,MI 1st Inns,6.4,"Mishra to Nitish Rana, FOUR, picks the length and reverse-sweeps Amit Mishra through backward point. There was a slip in place, but he got the timing right. Risky, but worth it",Mishra to Nitish Rana,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,0.1,"Sandeep Sharma to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, McCullum is off and running. No sighters needed. Short of length around off, McCullum hops a bit and directs the cut square on the off-side. There was a man at sweeper but he couldn't get there, such was the timing",Sandeep Sharma to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,1.5,"Mohit Sharma to Raina, FOUR, easy peasy. Can't bowl on the legs of any batsman. Raina shuffles across to get inside the line, helps it along the way past the man at 45. Off the mark with a boundary",Mohit Sharma to Raina,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,10.5,"Axar to Jadeja, FOUR, the boundary that they will need in every over from now has come. Was a bit short, Jadeja went back and thrashed past the man at cover",Axar to Jadeja,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,12.4,"Axar to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, not the kind of fielding effort you need. Dwayne Smith got on his knee and helped this flatter ball with a half-sweep. The man from deep backward square leg ran to his right, got to it but fumbled when it mattered the most",Axar to Dwayne Smith,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,15.0,"Axar to Andrew Tye, FOUR, gets low and across to use the inward angle from Axar, helps past the man at short fine leg. Welcome boundary",Axar to Andrew Tye,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,16.1,"Sandeep Sharma to Karthik, FOUR, the length is great on this one but the line is awful. On the legs of Karthik and he whips it through backward of square leg. Now they have got the four, need to make it count",Sandeep Sharma to Karthik,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,16.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Andrew Tye, FOUR, short ball, comes late to Andrew Tye - that is what the shot suggested. Andrew Tye is early on the pull and slices off the outer edge, over the head of the keeper and into the fine leg fence",Sandeep Sharma to Andrew Tye,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,17.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Karthik, FOUR, there's risk involved but he has to take all that is on offer. Karthik reverse sweeps this full ball to place it between short third man and backward point. This is his first fifty of the seaons. Will it be in a winning cause?",Sandeep Sharma to Karthik,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,19.1,"Sandeep Sharma to Basil Thampi, FOUR, aims for the blockhole and does well. Basil Thampi inside edges the drive past the keeper into the fine leg fence",Sandeep Sharma to Basil Thampi,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,2.1,"Sandeep Sharma to Raina, FOUR, when Raina is in form, he plays some audacious shots. This was not a bad ball by any means, length ball around off, Raina swats it over mid-wicket and wide of mid-on. That was dealt with disdain",Sandeep Sharma to Raina,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,2.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Raina, FOUR, top shot! Sandeep switches to round the wicket, fires in a low full toss around off, Raina stays low, opens the bat face and threads it behind point, right between short third man and backward point",Sandeep Sharma to Raina,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,4.1,"Cariappa to Raina, FOUR, two fielders dived and both could not stop the ball. Trifle short and Raina is quick to go back and whip it, first beats the dive of mid-on and then deep mid-wicket's. Placed to perfection",Cariappa to Raina,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,5.5,"Mohit Sharma to Karthik, FOUR, a gift first up for Karthik. Short delivery at 128kph, sat up nicely for the in form keeper, who swivels across and pulls it neatly behind square, well away from the short fine leg fielder",Mohit Sharma to Karthik,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,6.5,"Cariappa to Karthik, FOUR, half tracker and Karthik pounces on it. It was the carrom ball and turning away, Karthik rocked back and slapped it in front of square, no chance for the man sweeping",Cariappa to Karthik,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,8.1,"Axar to Karthik, FOUR, rubbish to start off from Axar. Long hop asking to be punished, Karthik obliges, rocks back and pulls it in front of square on the leg-side, one bounce and into the fence",Axar to Karthik,FOUR
7139797,GL 1st Inns,9.5,"Stoinis to Karthik, FOUR, the little things in cricket cost you so much. Karthik should have never been on strike, but thanks to Maxwell he was and he collects a boundary. Slower short delivery and Karthik swiveled to pull it behind square, good connection as the ball bounced only once before reaching the fence",Stoinis to Karthik,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,0.2,"Shubham Agarwal to Amla, FOUR, and he is away, in style. Gets a tossed up delivery just outside off. Stays leg-side and drives past cover, in the gap",Shubham Agarwal to Amla,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,1.0,"Shubham Agarwal to Amla, FOUR, poor ball to finish the over. And Amla won't let those go. It's short and wide.. well not that wide but wide enough for Amla to stay back and crack the cut past point",Shubham Agarwal to Amla,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,1.4,"Nathu Singh to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, not off the meat of the bat. But still runs away to the fence. Was angled across around off and Shaun Marsh drove from the crease; toe-ended but had enough to get it past the fielders near the cover region",Nathu Singh to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,10.0,"Andrew Tye to Amla, FOUR, clips it fine after getting across. Fetches a four to the fine leg fence to bring up his fifty",Andrew Tye to Amla,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,11.3,"Basil Thampi to Amla, FOUR, shoddy from McCullum. You rarely associate that word with him. Full delivery on off, Amla jams the drive into the pitch and bounces over Thampi, McCullum from mid-off runs across and lets it through. No one to cover him and that's four more to Amla",Basil Thampi to Amla,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,12.4,"Jadeja to Amla, FOUR, Amla's fast hands on display. Quicker and just outside off, Amla stays leg-side of the ball and brings his hands down on the ball, lofted inside out over extra cover, one bounce four",Jadeja to Amla,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,14.1,"Jadeja to Maxwell, FOUR, Maxwell toys with Jadeja. Plants his front leg across the stumps and hoicks it behind square. Maintained a low base to get underneath the ball and that was the key",Jadeja to Maxwell,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,16.0,"Andrew Tye to Axar, FOUR, shot! Stand and deliver stuff from Axar. It was the normal speed delivery and right in the slot, Axar didn't have to move much, extends his arms and lofts it straight back over Tye. A much needed boundary for KXIP",Andrew Tye to Axar,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,16.4,"Basil Thampi to Axar, FOUR, bang! Axar strikes them really hard. Thampi missed the yorker length by a good couple of inches, Axar pumps the drive straight down the ground. Rocketed to the fence and beat long-off with ease",Basil Thampi to Axar,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,18.2,"Dwayne Smith to Axar, FOUR, streaky! Angled across the left-hander, Axar throws everything he's got at it, the outside edge flies away fine to the third man fence. The man was inside the ring and he had no chance",Dwayne Smith to Axar,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,2.5,"Raina to Amla, FOUR, and again. Raina is shortish again and on seeing that Amla retreats, opens the face of the bat on the punch and cracks it through cover",Raina to Amla,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,4.2,"Basil Thampi to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, cross-batted heave from Shaun Marsh. The angle was taking it across him but he took his chance, did not get it off the middle. But had enough to beat the man running from deep square leg to his right",Basil Thampi to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,5.0,"Basil Thampi to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, that just about spoils the over for Thampi. Ended up giving room to Shaun Marsh just outside off. Enough for the latter to camp back and pierce the gap through point with a cut",Basil Thampi to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,5.1,"Andrew Tye to Amla, FOUR, Punjab have got boundaries but not all of them have been well timed ones. This one too is not. Amla makes room, tries to go flat-bat on this short ball. Mistimes but does well to get it just over the fielder at mid-off",Andrew Tye to Amla,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,5.3,"Andrew Tye to Amla, FOUR, too full a ball on off. Cannot be termed a poor ball but the brilliance of Amla. Opens the bat-face at the last moment and squeezes it square on the off-side",Andrew Tye to Amla,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,7.3,"Shubham Agarwal to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, dances down the track again. Shubham Agarwal smartly bowls it wide but does not get away. Shaun Marsh manages to reach on the drive and cracks it to the deep cover fence",Shubham Agarwal to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,8.5,"Jadeja to Amla, FOUR, flatter this time. This is a result of what happened on the previous ball. Ends up on the legs of Amla, who helps it to the fine leg fence with a little sweet tuck",Jadeja to Amla,FOUR

6991308,KKR 1st Inns,0.3,"Badree to Narine, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Narine, shimmies down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it back over the bowler's head, a couple of bounces and over the fence",Badree to Narine,FOUR
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,0.4,"Badree to Narine, FOUR, three in a row for Narine, comes down the track to a well flighted delivery and lifts it over Gayle at short extra-cover. This is a smashing start from KKR",Badree to Narine,FOUR
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,10.5,"Badree to M Pandey, FOUR, lovely shot, width on offer from Badree, it was short as well. Manish plays with an open face and carves it behind square on the off-side, beats the man at backward point and rolls away to the fence",Badree to M Pandey,FOUR
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,12.5,"Negi to Woakes, FOUR, risky but four, pushed through flatter and on the stumps, Woakes backed away, exposed his stumps and gets a thick edge on the cut, rolls away past Kohli at slip and into the fence",Negi to Woakes,FOUR
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,14.1,"Negi to Woakes, FOUR, takes on the tease, takes on the invite and gets himself a pressure releiving boundary. Clears his front leg, steps aside as well in the process and goes inside-out with his lofted drive",Negi to Woakes,FOUR
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,15.2,"Aravind to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, a sweep off a seamer. A major punch on the ego for sure. 127kph, on the sitting up length in the slot and Yadav strolls well across, sits on a knee and unleashes a flat bat to place it to perfection behind square",Aravind to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,16.1,"Tymal Mills to Woakes, FOUR, length balls at this stage. Woakes keeps up with the tradition of putting them away. Gets right iunder it with a burial and just swings his bat through the line. All the timing in spanking it through extra cover",Tymal Mills to Woakes,FOUR
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Aravind to Gambhir, FOUR, edged and four, it was deliberate from Gambhir, but was too close for comfort. Short of a good length and well outside off, Gambhir played with an open face and dabs it past Gayle at slip, rolls away to the fence",Aravind to Gambhir,FOUR
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,2.5,"Aravind to Narine, FOUR, Narine continues to make merry, back of a length and just outside off, Narine prods across and pulls it back over the bowler's head, a few bounces and over the ropes",Aravind to Narine,FOUR
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,3.0,"Aravind to Narine, FOUR, this will hurt RCB! Nothing wrong with the ball, just a fraction short and wide of off, Narine makes room and punches it in front of square on the off-side, splits the gap past cover and rolls away to the fence. KKR are off to a flier once again",Aravind to Narine,FOUR
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,3.5,"Tymal Mills to Uthappa, FOUR, lovely shot, fraction overpitched and just outside off, Uthappa leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and drives it back past the bowler.

6991308,KKR 1st Inns,5.1,"Binny to Uthappa, FOUR, sublime timing from Uthappa, length delivery on the stumps, Uthappa leans across and clips it towards mid-wicket, it was in the air but well wide of the fielder, races away to the fence in a hurry",Binny to Uthappa,FOUR
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,5.3,"Binny to Narine, FOUR, fuller length delivery outside off, the width was there and Narine threw his bat at that, ended up slicing it over backward point and into the fence",Binny to Narine,FOUR
6991308,RCB 1st Inns,1.4,"U Yadav to de Villiers, FOUR, away in style. Umesh tries the surprise full ball coming back in. Just that his opponent is a master of these tricks. Out-thinks him with a shuffle to clip it away through mid-wicket. Off and running, with some timing",U Yadav to de Villiers,FOUR
6991308,RCB 1st Inns,2.2,"Coulter-Nile to de Villiers, FOUR, a wasted delivery. Not quite the line to bowl to the best bat in these situations. Straying down leg hoping to swing it away and clips it behind square. Not quite the ideal one with a 7-2 field",Coulter-Nile to de Villiers,FOUR
6991308,RCB 1st Inns,2.4,"Coulter-Nile to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, the streaky edge comes into play. Doesn't matter, it is the free hit. Throws his bat out at a wide delivery and takes the edge to ensure that it flies past second slip",Coulter-Nile to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
6991308,RCB 1st Inns,3.0,"Coulter-Nile to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, oh glorious. In the midst of the madness of wickets tumbling, we have another spanking drive unleashed. Full, wide and carves it away with a square slap",Coulter-Nile to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR

6991308,RCB 1st Inns,5.3,"U Yadav to Gayle, FOUR, his first boundary. Off a top edge. He wouldn't complain though. Another well-directed short bouncer squares Gayle completely after getting him opened up and. He responds with a slash of the horizontal bat and the streaky edge flies almost into the third man ropes",U Yadav to Gayle,FOUR
6991308,RCB 1st Inns,6.0,"U Yadav to Binny, FOUR, width. Asking for the slap, gets the slap. But finds it just wide of Pandey;s full stretched dive at point. Rushes away `",U Yadav to Binny,FOUR

7614896,MI 1st Inns,1.4,"SN Thakur to Buttler, FOUR, third man is up and Buttler squirts it right off the toe-edge to squeeze this through the gap. A poor delivery from Thakur. This is way too short and wide and although Buttler almost failed to reach out, it deserved the punishment that it got",SN Thakur to Buttler,FOUR
7614896,MI 1st Inns,1.5,"SN Thakur to Buttler, FOUR, he's tickled that off middle and leg stump. Buttler walks right across, gets a full ball on the pads and just about gets his bat down in time. Would have been plumb had he missed",SN Thakur to Buttler,FOUR
7614896,MI 1st Inns,11.0,"Unadkat to Rohit, FOUR, walks across. Sits down. Gets under the fuller delivery and scoops it over the keeper. Almost off the toe end but with the field behind square up in the circle it seems safe",Unadkat to Rohit,FOUR
7614896,MI 1st Inns,12.4,"Stokes to Pollard, FOUR, here's the brute. A short one here that refuses to get up. A bare 123kph and Pollard spanks it with utter disdain. Pulls the leather off it to mid-wicket",Stokes to Pollard,FOUR
7614896,MI 1st Inns,13.2,"Tahir to Rohit, FOUR, a beastly slog. Opens and picks out the top-spinner half way down the track with a swivel to dispatch it just past the reach of a diving Rahane at mid-wicket. Takes his finger tips along as well",Tahir to Rohit,FOUR
7614896,MI 1st Inns,14.4,"Stokes to Rohit, FOUR, take that. You bowl length at your own peril. Stokes learns it the harsh way. A mighty swing of the bat and a punishing drill through the covers",Stokes to Rohit,FOUR

7614896,MI 1st Inns,17.5,"Unadkat to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, ruins it further. Hangs back patiently on the back foot toying around with the bowler's mind in waiting for the short-slower combo to get to him.

7614896,MI 1st Inns,2.2,"Washington Sundar to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, just over mid-on. He was itching to break free. It's slightly fuller from Sundar, but Parthiv isn't quite to the pitch of it.

4118946,KKR 1st Inns,13.2,"Mishra to Gambhir, FOUR, really poor delivery from Mishra. He strays in line, tosses it up on leg stump and all Gambhir does is paddle him away fine into the boundary",Mishra to Gambhir,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,13.3,"Mishra to Gambhir, FOUR, that's a tired dive from Zaheer at backward point. He's struggling with his hamstring too, so can't really blame him. But Mishra is just seething. He turns around in disgust. But this is awful bowling to begin with. Bowls it short and wide again, and Gambhir slices it neatly to the left of Zaheer. A younger fielder would have stopped that",Mishra to Gambhir,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,14.0,"Mishra to M Pandey, FOUR, drops it short again and Pandey swats him to the right of long-on to finish a truly horrendous over from Mishra. 13 off it",Mishra to M Pandey,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,15.1,"Chris Morris to Jackson, FOUR, that's more of a steer than a cut. Width on offer from Morris as he starts a new spell, Jackson times it beautifully as he guides it past backward point",Chris Morris to Jackson,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,15.4,"Chris Morris to Gambhir, FOUR, DD are just waiting for this to get over. The field is well up. Morris bowls it full just outside off and Gambhir just has to get his placement right as he drives through extra-cover",Chris Morris to Gambhir,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,16.0,"Chris Morris to Jackson, FOUR, a good little cameo this from Jackson. He's handling himself really well. Short of length into the body, he swivels nicely and pulls it away through backward square. Uppish but in the gap",Chris Morris to Jackson,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,16.2,"Rabada to Gambhir, FOUR, flicked away to the mid-wicket boundary. No one bothers to move. Huge open space in the field. Poor from DD. Not at all mindful of the net run rate",Rabada to Gambhir,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,2.2,"Corey Anderson to Gambhir, FOUR, first ball from Anderson and it is smashed for four. Short, wide and Gambhir had the width to free his arms, slaps it behind point and third man had no chance",Corey Anderson to Gambhir,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,4.4,"Pat Cummins to Gambhir, FOUR, errs in line and that is enough for Gambhir to collect a boundary. On leg-stump, Gambhir gets inside the line and uses Cummins's pace to glance it past the diving short fine fielder",Pat Cummins to Gambhir,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,5.5,"Rabada to Uthappa, leg byes, FOUR, sprays it down leg, Uthappa can't meet with the tickle, but the ball brushes the pad to beat Pant to his left. Poor ball that from Rabada",Rabada to Uthappa,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,6.0,"Rabada to Uthappa, FOUR, in the air and just over the leaping mid-on fielder. Uthappa is early into the pick up shot, more of a leading edge and the ball balloons over a backtracking mid-on fielder. The practice wickets take care of the rest",Rabada to Uthappa,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,6.1,"Mishra to Gambhir, FOUR, greeted with a dance down the wicket, gets right to the pitch of the flighted delivery and lofts it with the turn over mid-wicket, one bounce and into the fence. He's one of the best players of spin",Mishra to Gambhir,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,6.3,"Mishra to Uthappa, FOUR, now Uthappa uses the pace of Mishra to pick up a boundary. He waits and waits for the ball to arrive, then at the last second opens the bat face and runs it past the slip fielder",Mishra to Uthappa,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,7.0,"Mishra to Gambhir, FOUR, lovely shot! Another 50+ stand for the duo. Continuing from where they had left off in Pune. Loopy leg-break on the stumps, Gambhir makes just a bit of room and chips it beautifully inside out. The onus was on timing rather than power. Long-off dived in vain to stop that",Mishra to Gambhir,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,7.2,"Chris Morris to Uthappa, FOUR, full on off and middle, Uthappa flicks it uppishly over the mid-wicket fielder. Not timed well enough but has enough fuel to collect himself a boundary",Chris Morris to Uthappa,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,8.4,"Pat Cummins to Uthappa, FOUR, in the air and over the fielder. Cummins pitches it up and Uthappa does not need a second invitation, drives in the air and over Mishra at mid-off. Even a full length jump from Mishy wasn't enough",Pat Cummins to Uthappa,FOUR
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,9.5,"Corey Anderson to Gambhir, FOUR, the runs keep flowing. The 100 is up for KKR. The equation is down to a run-a-ball. This should be a cake walk. Banged in halfway down the wicket, Gambhir swats the pull over mid-wicket. He had to really reach out and did well to avoid the fielder",Corey Anderson to Gambhir,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Guptill, FOUR, guess it was against Pakistan in 2016 World T20 Guptill played a superb knock. He knows the conditions well here. Doesn't move much, gets inside the line of a fullish delivery and lifts the drive over extra cover",Bhuvneshwar to Guptill,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,1.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Guptill, FOUR, inswinger, Guptill exposes all his stumps and spanks it straight down the ground. Sheer power",Bhuvneshwar to Guptill,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,1.4,"Nehra to Guptill, FOUR. Whang! Guptill is making full use of the opportunity. Clears his front leg and smokes a full ball over mid-on. There's Warner at long-on, but he can't get there in time",Nehra to Guptill,FOUR

8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,10.2,"Henriques to Eoin Morgan, FOUR, action replay of the previous ball and that has been powered away through the covers. The man at sweeper cover despite not having to cover a lot to his right, ends up being a spectator",Henriques to Eoin Morgan,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,11.1,"Rashid Khan to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, the partnership between Shaun Marsh and Eoin Morgan is now 50. Short ball, flatter in trajectory and the batsman stays back to cut it away between short third man and point",Rashid Khan to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,12.3,"Henriques to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, length ball at the sticks and the batsman slashes the ball away across the line and threads it between long-on and deep mid-wicket. Fifty for Marsh! Another valuable knock from the run-machine from Punjab",Henriques to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,12.4,"Henriques to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, BOOM! Flat bats the short ball and Warner at long-on had no chance to grab that. Even the FEDEX would have been proud of that forehand smash",Henriques to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,12.5,"Henriques to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, Hooda was hoodoo-ed there! Drops a skier at deep mid-wicket. The short ball it was, Shaun Marsh took on the bait and managed a huge top-edge. The fielder in the deep made a meal of it as it went through his hands and to make matters worse, the ball bobbled away into the fence",Henriques to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,14.0,"Rashid Khan to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, jumps out, takes the ball on the half-volley and then goes straight down the ground. On a bounce and into the fence goes the ball.

8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,14.2,"S Kaul to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, short delivery and slightly wide as well. The batsman opens his arms and cuts it away. Hooda in the deep puts in the slide but the ball goes away from him to hit the cushion",S Kaul to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,14.4,"S Kaul to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, another chance for Shaun Marsh! This time Warner at deep mid-wicket allows the ball to burst through his fingers. Warner came in and then missed it. That was walloped though. The ball lands into a puddle",S Kaul to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,15.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, Marsh cooking up some great momentum now. Flurry of boundaries. Low full toss from Bhuvneshwar as he misses the wide yorker. Marsh uses the pace and steers it to split short third man and backward point",Bhuvneshwar to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,16.3,"Nehra to Axar, FOUR, right off the toe-end of the bat as Axar chases a very wide ball from Nehra, squirts it away past the keeper into the third man boundary. Went very fine",Nehra to Axar,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,16.4,"Nehra to Axar, FOUR, overpitched outside off and Axar crashes it through extra-cover. Blistering shot. He's in some good hitting form, carrying on from the last match",Nehra to Axar,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,17.5,"S Kaul to Anureet Singh, FOUR, dipping slower full toss, 113kph, Anureet swings it away to the square leg boundary. Kaul disgusted with himself",S Kaul to Anureet Singh,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,18.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Anureet Singh, FOUR, Anureet has unintentionally played the perfect slice to split short third man and backward point. He just swings hard at this length ball, wanting it carve it over extra-cover. The bat face opens beautifully on impact and the ball pops perfectly into the gap",Bhuvneshwar to Anureet Singh,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,19.4,"Nehra to Ishant, FOUR, Nehra not impressed, either by the effort from the keeper, or by Ishant's attempt at a pull. Ishant is rushed by this short of length ball and sends an outside edge past the diving Ojha into the third man boundary",Nehra to Ishant,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,2.0,"Nehra to Guptill, FOUR, mid-on chases...chases...chases and the ball wins the race. Not quite off the middle, but Guptill will take it. Slogs a length ball across the line to the right of mid-on where Siddarth Kaul comes second in the race",Nehra to Guptill,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,3.1,"Nehra to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, lovely, lovely shot! Pitched up outside off, Marsh drives on the up and gets it in the gap between cover and extra cover",Nehra to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,3.3,"Nehra to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, waits on the slower ball and cuts it at the last possible second. Bhuvi at third man runs to his right and puts in a dive, couldn't quite get his body behind the ball",Nehra to Shaun Marsh,FOUR

8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,6.1,"Henriques to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, Marsh is looking in sublime touch! Width on offer from Henriques, a gentle loosener to start, he leans back and cuts it square on the off-side, beats the fielder in the ring and rolls away to the fence",Henriques to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
8703679,SRH 1st Inns,1.2,"Anureet Singh to Dhawan, FOUR, first boundary for SRH. It was marginally short and Dhawan is on it in a flash. Quickly transfers his weight and pulls it to deep mid-wicket. The fielder there had no chance of cutting that",Anureet Singh to Dhawan,FOUR
8703679,SRH 1st Inns,1.3,"Anureet Singh to Dhawan, FOUR, this is poor from Anureet Singh. Sprays it down the leg side, all Dhawan had to do was to get some wood. He gets plenty of it and the ball races down to the fine leg fence in a jiffy",Anureet Singh to Dhawan,FOUR
8703679,SRH 1st Inns,13.5,"Cariappa to Dhawan, FOUR, in his half and he smashes it for a one-bounce four over mid-wicket. Good, clean swing of the bat",Cariappa to Dhawan,FOUR

8703679,SRH 1st Inns,14.3,"Mohit Sharma to Williamson, FOUR, on the pads, he will hit those all day long. All Williamson needed to do was to get bat on ball, tickled away with ease",Mohit Sharma to Williamson,FOUR
8703679,SRH 1st Inns,16.1,"Cariappa to Yuvraj, FOUR, should have been a single, but a bit of bad bounce adds to Vohra's woes as he ends up conceding a boundary. Yuvi lifts the drive on seeing the line wide of off and gets a lucky a boundary",Cariappa to Yuvraj,FOUR

8703679,SRH 1st Inns,5.1,"Ishant to Dhawan, FOUR, angles it into the left-hander. Dhawan slogs across the line and hits it to deep mid-wicket. Didn't get it where he wanted, but had enough bat to fetch him a boundary",Ishant to Dhawan,FOUR
8703679,SRH 1st Inns,6.3,"Cariappa to Dhawan, FOUR, two good balls followed by a poor one. Fires it down the leg side, Dhawan gets his paddle out. Short fine leg fielder is just a spectator",Cariappa to Dhawan,FOUR
8703679,SRH 1st Inns,8.1,"Anureet Singh to Dhawan, FOUR, streaky runs for Dhawan. Has a wry smile after that. Slogs across the line and gets a thick inside edge past the keeper. Wasn't far away from the stumps either",Anureet Singh to Dhawan,FOUR
8703679,SRH 1st Inns,8.4,"Anureet Singh to Warner, FOUR, short delivery down the leg. Not the ideal length to be bowling at that pace for Warner, who waits for the ball and turns it to vacant deep square leg",Anureet Singh to Warner,FOUR
8703679,SRH 1st Inns,8.5,"Anureet Singh to Warner, FOUR, this is class from Warner. Anureet Singh corrects his line but still goes for four as Warner waits for it longer and steers it past point. Third man had no chance",Anureet Singh to Warner,FOUR
8703679,SRH 1st Inns,9.4,"Maxwell to Dhawan, FOUR, poor line from Maxwell. Dhawan helps it down to fine leg and gets another boundary. Actually it was clever bowling from Maxwell, he saw Dhawan race down and fired it down leg, but the southpaw outdid him",Maxwell to Dhawan,FOUR

6727718,RCB 1st Inns,20.0,"Christian to Aravind, FOUR, that's a good lofted drive, but RPS have won by a massive 61 runs. This will lift their net run rate by some margin. Is that it then for RCB? Maybe they still have an outside chance",Christian to Aravind,FOUR
6727718,RCB 1st Inns,5.3,"Christian to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, nice way to get going, tad shorter and wider of off, Kedar is quick to rock back and pulls it high and over mid-on, a few bounces and over the ropes",Christian to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR

1229540,MI 1st Inns,13.2,"Faulkner to Pollard, FOUR, another edge, different result, elation previous, agony on this. That cut away from the right-hander, Pollard edged it as he had a feel for it. The edge carried just past the diving tentacles of Karthik. Only if they had a slip",Faulkner to Pollard,FOUR
1229540,MI 1st Inns,15.2,"Faulkner to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, length ball and that has been dragged down the ground with powerful sinews. The ball landed close to the man at mid-off and then raced away into the fence for a four. A much needed relief for MI",Faulkner to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
1229540,MI 1st Inns,16.1,"Basil Thampi to Pollard, FOUR, length ball sits up for the batsman to hack the pull away and loft it over mid-wicket. The man at long-on was light years away from that",Basil Thampi to Pollard,FOUR
1229540,MI 1st Inns,18.0,"Faulkner to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, goes for the slog, the ball chalks the inner meatier part of the bat and that is enough to send it away from the diving long-on fielder. BMac gave it a valiant chase and dived full stretched to his left but the ball landed away from him and went over the fence. That four has helped things for MI",Faulkner to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
1229540,MI 1st Inns,2.2,"Irfan Pathan to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, bangs it in short without any venom behind it. Patel gets into a good position and pulls it behind square on the leg-side",Irfan Pathan to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
1229540,MI 1st Inns,3.0,"Irfan Pathan to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, 16 off Irfan Pathan's first over in IPL 2017. He errs in line drifting down leg, Parthiv moves across and helps it away behind square on the leg-side. The ball races away into the fence. MI are off to a flier",Irfan Pathan to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
1229540,MI 1st Inns,5.1,"Andrew Tye to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, cheekiness at its best! Knuckle ball from Tye well outside off. The ball almost went past him, and Parthiv opens his bat face at the very last instant. The ball runs away into the third man fence",Andrew Tye to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
1229540,MI 1st Inns,9.1,"Ankit Soni to Nitish Rana, FOUR, too much width and Rana punishes him. The back-spinner, Rana crouches and lifts it inside out over cover for a boundary. That's Raina-esque",Ankit Soni to Nitish Rana,FOUR
9007667,DC 1st Inns,13.0,"Axar to Rabada, FOUR, handy boundary for Rabada, comes down the track, gets close to the ball and drills it back over his partner's head, a couple of bounces and over the ropes",Axar to Rabada,FOUR
9007667,DC 1st Inns,2.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Samson, FOUR, nicely played by Samson, that should get him going, fraction short and wide of off, he leans forward, plays with a flat-bat and gets it in the gap - wide of extra-cover",Sandeep Sharma to Samson,FOUR
9007667,DC 1st Inns,3.3,"T Natarajan to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, lovely shot, overpitched and wide outside off, Shreyas leans forward, meets the ball on top of the bounce and drives it crisply past cover, no one moved",T Natarajan to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
9007667,KXIP 1st Inns,0.3,"Shami to Guptill, FOUR, Guptill and Punjab are away. Takes a step forward, manufactures his own room and thrashes it over cover. Kings XI anthem blares in the background",Shami to Guptill,FOUR
9007667,KXIP 1st Inns,1.0,"Shami to Guptill, FOUR, Guptill is in a hurry here. Wasting no time as he backs away to this back of a length delivery and bullies it through the packed off-side field. Not so productive start for Shami and DD",Shami to Guptill,FOUR
9007667,KXIP 1st Inns,2.0,"Rabada to Amla, FOUR, classic shot from Amla. Just a soft push from the crease to this full toss and it roars away to the fence. Beats extra cover, minimum effort there from the mighty Hash!",Rabada to Amla,FOUR
9007667,KXIP 1st Inns,3.4,"Rabada to Guptill, FOUR, cheeky and effective for Guptill. Cleverly arches his back on seeing this short ball outside off, opens his bat face and elevates it over first slip. One bounce and into the fence",Rabada to Guptill,FOUR
9007667,KXIP 1st Inns,4.0,"Rabada to Guptill, FOUR, ooh, he didn't time it as he would've liked but still earns himself a boundary. A dipping low full toss from Rabada, Guptill miscued it as he dragged it off the cue-end. Squirts it over mid-off and off it goes away to the fence",Rabada to Guptill,FOUR
9007667,KXIP 1st Inns,5.4,"Shami to Guptill, FOUR, raining boundaries off Guptill's willow. Again moves away to leg-side, takes on this back of a length delivery and blasts it wide of mid-on. He didn't find the sweet spot but it doesn't matter anyway",Shami to Guptill,FOUR
9007667,KXIP 1st Inns,5.5,"Shami to Guptill, FOUR, Shami's radar goes haywire. Spills it on the pads, easy pickings for Guptill as he gets inside the line and flicks it past the man at 45",Shami to Guptill,FOUR
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Gambhir, FOUR, ends up being a short on the legs of Gambhir, who whips it from there. Through square leg and into the fence. Not quite timed but fetches him a four",Bhuvneshwar to Gambhir,FOUR
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,1.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Gambhir, FOUR, low full toss and Gambhir cracks it past mid-off to bring his second four of the over. The idea from Bhuvneshwar was to bowl a yorker but could not control it there",Bhuvneshwar to Gambhir,FOUR
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,14.0,"Rashid Khan to Jackson, FOUR, good shot. Looked pretty. Was bowled full and wide, Jackson had made the room early but inclines his weight across, pinned on his front foot, and smothers the drive through covers. 92 off 36",Rashid Khan to Jackson,FOUR
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,16.2,"Bhuvneshwar to de Grandhomme, FOUR, a certain Bhuvneshwar Kumar yorker that's becoming famous by the day, quite beating his physique. Slightly leg-sidish and Grandhomme gets just enough tickle on this. Through fine leg. Boundary",Bhuvneshwar to de Grandhomme,FOUR
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,19.3,"S Kaul to Woakes, FOUR, uses the width on this cutter and cleverly steers it wide of backward point. In between the two fielders and gets a boundary. KKR will lose by 4 less now",S Kaul to Woakes,FOUR
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,3.0,"S Kaul to Uthappa, FOUR, bit cross-batted but as long as they fetch runs. Got across to this length delivery and whipped between the man at mid-on and mid-wicket. Bhuvi with a chase there but soon realised it was only going to be a futile one. Kaul didn't like it one bit. Has a few words to say to which Robbie responds",S Kaul to Uthappa,FOUR
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,3.4,"Siraj to Uthappa, FOUR, that is a sonorous sound off the bat, not for the bowler of course. Is not that full around off, but Uthappa trusts the pace and drives on the up, past cover and into the fence in no time",Siraj to Uthappa,FOUR
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,3.5,"Siraj to Uthappa, FOUR, he's played the field there. So aware of the men around him. The slip is wide and the third man is not covering for him. Uses the pace and opens the face of the bat to bisect the keeper and Williamson",Siraj to Uthappa,FOUR
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,4.2,"S Kaul to M Pandey, FOUR, and that is what you get for keeping the bat straight. Uncomplicated stuff, hits the on-drive to this length ball on the up and leaves mid-on redundant",S Kaul to M Pandey,FOUR
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,4.5,"S Kaul to M Pandey, FOUR, majestic! Half-volley this time but Pandey knew where the field was, hit the straight drive in the air but past the bowler. Is so straight that long-on does not stand a chance to his right",S Kaul to M Pandey,FOUR
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,6.0,"Henriques to M Pandey, FOUR, not sure how well that was timed but it manages to beat Warner to the fence. Pandey once again backed away in the crease and to his liking got a shortish ball. A cross-batted whip beat the man at mid-on first, before Warner gave up running across from deep mid-wicket",Henriques to M Pandey,FOUR
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,8.2,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, FOUR, the previous shot forces Rashid Khan to pitch it short and Uthappa makes merry. Goes back and pulls it straight down the ground",Rashid Khan to Uthappa,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,0.4,"Coulter-Nile to Warner, FOUR, Coulter-Nile overpitches looking for swing, but it's not moving. Warner lofts over the infield, the bat turned in hands, but made good enough contact to clear the man at mid-off. That gets the crowd going, first boundary of the game. 1000 runs for Davey Warner at Uppal",Coulter-Nile to Warner,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,12.2,"Woakes to Dhawan, FOUR, now Dhawan gets a boundary. Short and on the stumps, Dhawan pulls it through mid-wicket and beats the fielder in the deep",Woakes to Dhawan,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,14.4,"U Yadav to Williamson, FOUR, clever shot from Williamson. Spotted that long-off was inside the ring, picked the slower ball, went back and lofted that nicely over the top for a boundary",U Yadav to Williamson,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,15.1,"Narine to Warner, FOUR, in the airrr, Pandey dives full length to his right at long-off and gets a hand on it. Excellent effort. Flighted delivery from Narine, Warner smashed it down the ground",Narine to Warner,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,15.2,"Narine to Warner, FOUR, he's picking the spots so well. Was cramped for room, backed away and managed to loft it over cover",Narine to Warner,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,15.3,"Narine to Warner, FOUR, the carnage continues, flighted delivery down the leg-side, Warner sweeps, past the diving fielder at short fine leg for four",Narine to Warner,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,17.5,"Coulter-Nile to Williamson, FOUR, that's lovely placement from Williamson. Another full toss from Coulter-Nile, Williamson doesn't try to over-hit the ball, lofts the drive over cover and beats sweeper cover",Coulter-Nile to Williamson,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,18.3,"Woakes to Williamson, FOUR, that movement across the stumps was playing on the bowler's mind, he tried to bowl full and wide outside off stump again, Williamson stays put, lofts handsomely to the right of mid-off",Woakes to Williamson,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,18.5,"Woakes to Williamson, FOUR, how did he manage to hit that so well. Good slower ball bouncer, Williamson got into an awkward position to scoop that, went through with that shot and it bounced inside the rope",Woakes to Williamson,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,19.0,"Woakes to Williamson, FOUR, cheeky from Kane! Moved right across the stumps and paddled that, didn't middle it, got a bit of an edge, but that was good enough, short fine leg had no chance. 200 up for Hyderabad",Woakes to Williamson,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,2.1,"Woakes to Warner, FOUR, that is class for you! Certainly not all that a bad ball, but Warner's in the mood. Short of a length, just outside off stump, so he had to manufacture a bit of space for himself to be able to cut that ball. He jumps and then backs away slightly to cut it away to the right of backward point",Woakes to Warner,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,3.2,"Y Pathan to Warner, FOUR, fine leg is inside the ring and Warner gets across the stumps to pull it over the man at 45",Y Pathan to Warner,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,3.3,"Y Pathan to Warner, FOUR, this is poor bowling, but that is what Warner can do! When he is in such a murderous mood, the bowler is afraid to bowl full, it's a short ball again, Warner knew what was coming, went back and cut it away over cover-point",Y Pathan to Warner,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,4.3,"Narine to Warner, FOUR, he's pierced that gap so well. Shortish and spinning away outside off stump, Warner cuts well and sends it between cover and cover-point. He wants to make the most of this powerplay",Narine to Warner,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,5.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Dhawan, FOUR, different bowler and Dhawan takes him on this time. Not the ideal start from Kuldeep, dropped it way too short, gave Dhawan enough time to camp back and smash it over mid-on",Kuldeep Yadav to Dhawan,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,5.3,"Kuldeep Yadav to Warner, FOUR, the switch-hit again and the backward point boundary is free. Bit of a top-edge from Warner, but the ball escaped. He doesn't want to allow the bowler to settle",Kuldeep Yadav to Warner,FOUR
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,9.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Warner, FOUR, have seen him practice those switch-hits in the training, it's coming out so well. Careful Davey, don't let the rule-makers take notice and force a rule change. This is smashed through point",Kuldeep Yadav to Warner,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,1.0,"Aniket Choudhary to Nitish Rana, FOUR, freebie and Rana won't miss out. He's a man in form. Kohli would not want his bowlers to bowl such balls. On the pads, easy glance to the fine leg fence. First boundary for the hosts",Aniket Choudhary to Nitish Rana,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,1.4,"Chahal to Nitish Rana, FOUR, did that carry? No it didn't! Kohli is not happy as the ball escaped for four. The fielder didn't do much wrong there. He went for the catch and it landed just in front him. Rana swept uppishly towards backward square leg and got away with it",Chahal to Nitish Rana,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,10.2,"Milne to Rohit, FOUR, poor delivery! This is a pressure-releaser. Short and wide outside off stump, really poor delivery, Rohit cuts uppishly to the left of backward point and third man had no chance",Milne to Rohit,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,11.0,"Milne to Pollard, FOUR, turns out to be a 12-run over, just what MI wanted to get that momentum back. On the leg stump was the slower delivery, no one at fine leg and a gentle glance was all that was required",Milne to Pollard,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,12.4,"Chahal to Pollard, FOUR, Pollard gets a boundary but the bowler won the mini battle there, the batsman stepped out, was the googly, Pollard went through with the swing, mistimed it but managed to place it to the right of long-on",Chahal to Pollard,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,14.5,"Aniket Choudhary to Rohit, FOUR, that's nicely played. Full and well outside off stump, Rohit waits for the ball to come and square-drives it past backward point",Aniket Choudhary to Rohit,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,15.0,"Aniket Choudhary to Rohit, FOUR, oh what a shot! Aniket over pitches this full delivery, Rohit leans forward and drives hard through cover, Chahal dives to his right and gets a hand on it, yet the ball comfortably reached the fence",Aniket Choudhary to Rohit,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,15.3,"Chahal to Karn Sharma, FOUR, smashed straight down the ground, can Kohli get there? He can but in trying to pull it back, doesn't deflect it back inside the playing area. It was too full and Karn Sharma knelt down to hit that back over the bowler",Chahal to Karn Sharma,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,16.1,"Watson to Rohit, FOUR, Chahal at extra cover gave that up very easily. But that was timed so beautifully by Rohit. A back foot punch with a high backlift, hitting the ball on the top of its bounce, the weight going into the shot and powered away. Great start to the over",Watson to Rohit,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,19.5,"Watson to Rohit, FOUR, MI win! Rohit does it for his team. No big celebrations. Just a big smile and then a hug with Hardik Pandya. Low full toss as Watson missed the yorker, thumped wide of extra cover and mid-off was inside the ring as well. Raced away and MI have done the double over RCB this season - but it must be said that the Kohli-led side had chances to win both games. 8th loss for RCB out of 11 this year. MI go top of the table",Watson to Rohit,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,2.0,"Chahal to Nitish Rana, FOUR, that's nicely played. Didn't try to over-hit the ball, flighted delivery outside off stump, Rana leans forward and drives along the ground, beats AB's dive to his right at mid-off",Chahal to Nitish Rana,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,2.1,"Milne to Buttler, FOUR, Buttler loves pace on the ball. He's at ease when he plays the fast bowlers. Milne went full searching for swing, but went as a juicy half-volley, Buttler drives it to the right of extra-cover and it raced away",Milne to Buttler,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,2.2,"Milne to Buttler, FOUR, now Milne bangs it short, this is not a WACA to trouble batsmen with bounce, sits up nicely, Buttler stands tall and doesn't bother to keep the ball along the ground as he pulls through mid-wicket",Milne to Buttler,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,3.0,"Milne to Buttler, FOUR, how well has he timed that? This is the second time the ball has gone past a diving AB de Villiers. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Buttler plays a back foot drive, plays it to the left of cover and it escaped across the turf. This is a fast start from Mumbai, despite a first-ball wicket",Milne to Buttler,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,4.2,"Aravind to Nitish Rana, FOUR, wow! Lovely drive, Aravind bowls a full ball, didn't swing, Rana leant into the drive and placed it to the right of mid-on. Moves into the 20s",Aravind to Nitish Rana,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,4.5,"Aravind to Buttler, FOUR, overpitched and Buttler goes aerial. Just cleared his front leg a bit and lofted through the line, well wide of mid-off and on the bounce for four",Aravind to Buttler,FOUR
4078176,MI 1st Inns,9.0,"Watson to Rohit, FOUR, Rohit has seen enough of this good length stuff from Watson. Decides to score a boundary, plays across the line and chips it over mid-wicket, splits deep mid-wicket and long-on to perfection",Watson to Rohit,FOUR
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,0.2,"McClenaghan to Mandeep, FOUR, Mandeep is off the mark first ball. But with a boundary. Width outside off, crashed wide of cover-point and on this outfield, no-one is stopping that. Nice shot as he freed his arms",McClenaghan to Mandeep,FOUR
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,0.4,"McClenaghan to Mandeep, FOUR, a mistimed pull, but four. Over square leg. The length wasn't there for the shot, but Mandeep muscled that, got it off the splice of the bat but managed to clear the square leg umpire",McClenaghan to Mandeep,FOUR
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,1.4,"Malinga to Mandeep, FOUR, Anil Kumar Chaudhary has a wry smile on his face. Because Malinga was appealing for an lbw. The umpire spotted the tickle. A slower ball yorker from Malinga that dips on the batsman, Malinga's trademark weapon. But Mandeep picked that and got it wide of short fine inside the ring",Malinga to Mandeep,FOUR
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,10.2,"Krunal Pandya to Head, FOUR, one bounce over the ropes at wide long-on. Head against the left-arm spinner is always advantage to the batsman. He kneels down and slogs it into the gap. Did well to hit it wide of Pollard",Krunal Pandya to Head,FOUR
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,11.2,"Karn Sharma to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, sees the tossed up delivery and is onto that in a flash. Skips down and blasts it straight down the ground. Clean strike and went the distance",Karn Sharma to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,16.3,"Bumrah to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, fabulous whip off the pads. Drifting into middle, a length delivery and Kedar Jadhav used his strong forearms to power it away, beats deep mid-wicket's desperate dive",Bumrah to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,19.3,"McClenaghan to Negi, FOUR, can't miss your length with this field. Since both long-off and long-on are wide. Full and outside off, blasted over the umpire's head. Negi is playing a blinder here",McClenaghan to Negi,FOUR
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,5.4,"McClenaghan to de Villiers, FOUR, that's classy from de Villiers. This bouncing ball was cramping him for room, but he arched back and then created his own momentum to cut it over backward point. Wide of sweeper as well. That's a top top shot",McClenaghan to de Villiers,FOUR
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,7.4,"Malinga to de Villiers, FOUR, low full toss outside off, belted past short extra cover. He needed to hit that gap and did so easily",Malinga to de Villiers,FOUR
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,8.2,"Krunal Pandya to de Villiers, FOUR, lovely shot. Waited for the ball to turn away and then delayed the shot to send it wide of point, sweeper had too much distance to cover and the ball beat him",Krunal Pandya to de Villiers,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,0.2,"Unadkat to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, gee, this man. It's not short, it's just wide. And seams in a touch to cut the room, but the hands that McCullum has. Cuts it up and over covers. No feet, all hands",Unadkat to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,1.0,"Unadkat to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, there wasn't any room there, not much pace either - some 124 odd kays - but the trick was in playing late. McCullum does that. Plays close to his body, opens the bat face and steers a boundary behind the dive of short third",Unadkat to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,10.1,"Stokes to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, edged and four! Pacy length ball wide of off, McCullum looks to drive with hard hands and gets a fat outside edge. Runs well past the keeper's reach and races away into the third man fence. Tahir puts a desperate dive, but can't stop it",Stokes to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,11.3,"SN Thakur to Karthik, FOUR, shot! Right off the middle of the bat. Thakur offers with outside off and Karthik smacks the drive through extra cover. Reached the fence like a bullet",SN Thakur to Karthik,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,12.4,"Stokes to Jadeja, FOUR, wow! A brave shot from Jaddu. Waltzes down the track, gets to the pitch of the delivery and thumps it down the ground. With mid-on inside the circle, that's a safe shot. Gets it well wide of him and the ball has enough legs to go past the boundary rope",Stokes to Jadeja,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,13.0,"Stokes to Jadeja, FOUR, boundary to end the over. It didn't come off the middle of the bat, but Jadeja won't mind. It was a short ball from Stokes. Jadeja is slightly late on his pull and gets it off the top part of the bat. Finds the gap in the deep mid-wicket area",Stokes to Jadeja,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,13.4,"SN Thakur to Jadeja, FOUR, that's a gift and Jadeja won't miss out. Short of a good length delivery drifting down leg, Jadeja tickles it fine. Runs away into the fine leg fence",SN Thakur to Jadeja,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,18.5,"Stokes to Karthik, FOUR, much needed boundary. Another slower delivery, Karthik dances down and heaves it away into the deep square leg fence",Stokes to Karthik,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,19.2,"Unadkat to Karthik, FOUR, improvisation at its best. Reverses his stance even before the ball is delivered and brooms it away between short third man and backward point",Unadkat to Karthik,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,3.4,"Washington Sundar to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, completely duped. Totally. Kishan was looking to shimmy out but slipped, and to make things worse, Sundar drops it slightly wider. Kishan has to reach out and trims an inside edge past the leg-stump. Four. All that and four",Washington Sundar to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,4.2,"Stokes to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, that's a shot that will shove you into a crisis. An outside edge or a glide? Yes, McCullum made room there but to drive, through covers. May have opened the bat face but that was an edge that beat short third, and raced away",Stokes to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,5.3,"Tahir to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, the partnership between Ishan Kishan and Brendon McCullum is now 50+. A low, flat dipping full toss on middle and leg, and Ishan has hurried himself into a sweep round the corner",Tahir to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,5.4,"Tahir to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, smacks a wide full ball, flat-batted, wide of Smith's one-handed leap at mid-off. Good aggressive shot that",Tahir to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,6.4,"SN Thakur to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, that has McCullum's swagger stamped all over it. Look at him making room, whilst stepping down the track, and smaking it flat-batted wide of Steven Smith at mid-off. Does put in a dive but that was motoring away. Not a chance, even with a dive",SN Thakur to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
5594334,GL 1st Inns,8.4,"Christian to Finch, FOUR, now he's managed to get under a very full ball. The trick was in not reaching out for the ball. Stayed put, lifted the ball and got it over wide mid-on. Good shot",Christian to Finch,FOUR
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,0.2,"Sangwan to Rahane, FOUR, drifts on the pads of Rahane, who does not have to do much. Gets on his toes and tickles it into the fine leg fence to get things going",Sangwan to Rahane,FOUR
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,0.5,"Sangwan to Smith, FOUR, the bait that Smith throws to the bowler - shuffles across to this inswinging ball and flicks through mid-wicket to get off the mark with a boundary",Sangwan to Smith,FOUR
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,12.0,"Dwayne Smith to Stokes, FOUR, Stokes leaves his crease too early. Dwayne Smith sees that and throws it pretty wide but that does not help him get away. Stokes manages to put some bat and squeezes it to the deep backward point fence",Dwayne Smith to Stokes,FOUR
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,15.3,"Dwayne Smith to Stokes, FOUR, now makes room to a ball that was always going to be fuller, and slaps it through covers. Top shot as a follow up to that brute of a ball",Dwayne Smith to Stokes,FOUR
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,16.5,"Basil Thampi to Stokes, FOUR, that's a I-don't-want-you-to-be-a-bowler hit. Takes his front leg out of the way and flat-bats Thampi over his head. Disparaging hit. Utterly disdainful",Basil Thampi to Stokes,FOUR
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,17.3,"Sangwan to Christian, FOUR, past Faulkner at backward point. Dives sideways with outstretched right hand but can't stop this brutal cut from Christian. Saw the width and just laid into it",Sangwan to Christian,FOUR
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,19.1,"Faulkner to Stokes, FOUR, no more an IPL virgin. Pune goes loud and berserk as Stokes hits a century here. His first in the Indian Premier League. His first ever in Twenty20s. Backs away and slaps a drive through extra cover. What a gorgeous shot. Raises his bat after a fist-pump and screeches, in cramps and joy, err.. He's almost taken Pune home here",Faulkner to Stokes,FOUR
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,2.2,"Sangwan to Stokes, FOUR, keeping things simple and straight is Stokes there. There was a hint of movement on this full ball. Stokes did well to not try something fancy, presented the full blade and bisected the gap between the bowler and mid-on",Sangwan to Stokes,FOUR
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,3.1,"Basil Thampi to Stokes, FOUR, Stokes was on the charge for a moment but saw the length early. It was a bit shortish outside off and Stokes fetched the pull from there, hit it all along the ground to the deep mid-wicket fence",Basil Thampi to Stokes,FOUR
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,4.4,"Sangwan to Tripathi, FOUR, wow shot from Tripathi. Pure timing from Tripathi. Stands tall to this short ball and cuts past the man at backward point",Sangwan to Tripathi,FOUR
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,5.2,"Faulkner to Stokes, FOUR, slower ball that is too wide, makes things easy for Stokes. He stays back in the crease and thumps past the man at cover. Once he has got that out of the ring, it is always racing away",Faulkner to Stokes,FOUR
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,7.1,"Jadeja to Dhoni, FOUR, those trunk-like forearms take over. Jadeja tosses outside off and Dhoni drives with the turn. Places it wide of sweeper whose dive makes contact with the ball but fails to keep that in. First boundary for Dhoni",Jadeja to Dhoni,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,1.3,"Siraj to Nair, FOUR, that's a cracking shot to get off the mark! That was a gift from Siraj. Short and wide outside off, Nair backs away, clears the front leg and slaps it hard over covers. One bounce and over the fence",Siraj to Nair,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,10.0,"Henriques to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, that's one of the best shots of the game. A slight move across and offers a straight bat to send it between long-on and deep mid-wicket",Henriques to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,16.5,"Siraj to Chris Morris, FOUR, placed! Well placed! This is what Delhi were lacking. It is a short ball and Chris Morris rolls his wrists on the pull to bisect the fielders converging from deep backward square leg and deep mid-wicket",Siraj to Chris Morris,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Corey Anderson, FOUR, there is a thing called luck. But there is nothing called like a bowler's luck. He is always at the receiving end of things. It is a yorker, almost fells Corey Anderson down. Cannot get his bat down in time but manages to put some willow on it. That is enough to deflect this to the fine leg fence",Bhuvneshwar to Corey Anderson,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,19.1,"Henriques to Corey Anderson, FOUR, Short ball. Corey Anderson pulls and mid-off is in the ring, this will be a four, giving Delhi a much-needed win. Has this been given as four or is it only a single? Yes it is a four. Delhi win by 6-wickets",Henriques to Corey Anderson,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR, nothing wrong this time. Right off the middle. Kumar offers width wide of off on this short of length delivery and Samson takes advantage of it. He punches it and bisects cover and cover-point. Races away",Bhuvneshwar to Samson,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,3.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR, a very unlike Bhuvi over. He was all over the place this over. Shortish delivery outside off, you don't offer width to this guy. Flays the bat hard at it and lifts it over the infield on the off-side. Bullets into the cover fence",Bhuvneshwar to Samson,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,4.0,"S Kaul to Nair, FOUR, 2 runs off the first four balls, and then leaks 10 runs off the next two. DD are off to a flier. Kaul pitches it up and Nair drills it down the ground with a shimmy down. All along the carpet, into the fence",S Kaul to Nair,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,4.4,"Siraj to Nair, FOUR, nowhere near the middle of the bat, but Nair won't mind a bit. Nair backs away and wanted to loft it inside-out over covers. Since the ball was a slower one, he ends up slicing it over covers. The quick outfield does the rest",Siraj to Nair,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,5.1,"Henriques to Nair, FOUR, this time well over short fine. The keeper is up and Henriques bowls a full length delivery just outside off, Nair shuffles across and nicely scoops it away over Bhuvi and the ball races away",Henriques to Nair,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,5.5,"Henriques to Nair, FOUR, four more! The runs are coming thick and fast for DD. Not the greatest of deliveries from Henriques. Short and drifting down leg, Nair gets inside the line and pulls it fine, beating the diving fine leg fielder",Henriques to Nair,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,6.1,"Rashid Khan to Pant, FOUR, welcome to Delhi says Rishabh Pant. A loosener from Rashid Khan. Quick delivery well down leg, Pant is quick to get low and smack the sweep well wide of short fine",Rashid Khan to Pant,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,8.1,"Rashid Khan to Pant, FOUR, poor ball and Pant takes full toll of it. Low full toss, Pant sinks low and smacks the sweep through square leg. Off the sweet spot of the bat",Rashid Khan to Pant,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,9.3,"Henriques to Pant, FOUR, that's a gross delivery. Short and wide outside off, Pant waits for it and lifts it over extra cover for four runs",Henriques to Pant,FOUR
8831525,DC 1st Inns,9.4,"Henriques to Pant, FOUR, four more! Henriques isn't learning here. He is continuously offfering width outside off. Pant spots it and pummels it in front of square on the off-side. No chance for Dhawan in the deep",Henriques to Pant,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,0.2,"Jayant Yadav to Warner, FOUR, and he's away in a flash. Shortish and just outside off stump, Warner rocks back and cuts fiercely through cover-point",Jayant Yadav to Warner,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,1.1,"Rabada to Dhawan, FOUR, not the ideal start for Rabada. Fullish and swinging into the left-hander, Dhawan flicks, fine leg is inside the ring and he had no chance. Off the mark in a flash",Rabada to Dhawan,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,1.5,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR, oh this goes at a catchable height but there is no one at extra-cover. Would have been a straightforward chance. Warner is certainly having trouble facing Rabada's angle, chips gently, was a poor shot and he'd say that he deliberately played that with that gap on the off-side. Didn't look convincing though",Rabada to Warner,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,10.4,"Mishra to Williamson, FOUR, delicate. The googly just outside off, Williamson waited for it to arrive, opened the bat face and steers it past the diving short third man",Mishra to Williamson,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,13.2,"Shami to Yuvraj, FOUR, oh gosh! That was vintage Yuvraj. Full delivery on the stumps, Yuvraj does not bother to get his front leg behind the line, short-arm jabs the loft over the bowler's head, one bounce and over the ad hoardings",Shami to Yuvraj,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,14.3,"Mishra to Yuvraj, FOUR, anything in his zone and Yuvraj is willing to take it on. The googly which is a bit full in length, Yuvraj's back leg is in the air as he lofts it over Mishra. Almost similar to the one he played in the last over",Mishra to Yuvraj,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,15.2,"Shami to Yuvraj, FOUR, he's not gonna miss out twice in two balls. Shami drifts another one on the pads, Yuvraj gets the faintest of touches on the ball and it races away to the fine leg fence",Shami to Yuvraj,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,16.0,"Shami to Yuvraj, FOUR, brilliant stop from Mathews. But did he touch the cushions? The third umpire has a look and spots something in contact with the triangles. Short delivery and Yuvraj pulls in front of square, Mathews ran in from deep square, dived and stopped the ball, but it was spinning back towards the rope and he flicked it in and that's when he was in touch",Shami to Yuvraj,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,17.1,"Rabada to Henriques, FOUR, boundary to start the 18th. The slower delivery that drifts onto the batsman's hips, Henriques does not do anything fancy, tickles it round the corner and allows the outfield to do the rest",Rabada to Henriques,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,17.3,"Rabada to Yuvraj, FOUR, unlucky! Yuvraj is hurried by the short delivery, but at this stage of the innings the batsmen tend to throw their bat at everything, the top edge flies over short fine and lands just in front of the rope",Rabada to Yuvraj,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,18.0,"Rabada to Henriques, FOUR, big over for SRH. 20 off it and Rabada has been put under pressure. Fuller and width on offer, Henriques square drives and the placement is superb, well wide of the man sweeping on the off-side",Rabada to Henriques,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,18.3,"Chris Morris to Yuvraj, FOUR, Morris is shaking his head, but there is very little he can do about that. The yorker just outside off, Yuvraj waited and went low, opened the bat face and dug it to the right of short third man, who dived just as an afterthought",Chris Morris to Yuvraj,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,18.4,"Chris Morris to Yuvraj, FOUR, fifty for Yuvraj. Even though it is Delhi, the crowd are up on their feet to applaud the knock. Yuvraj acknowledges it with a wave of the bat. The slower length delivery, heaved in front of square, bisecting the two men in the deep",Chris Morris to Yuvraj,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,19.1,"Rabada to Yuvraj, no ball, FOUR, horrendous start. He oversteps and dishes out a full delivery, Yuvraj's hands take over, he drives it past extra cover and the ball raced away to the fence. No chance for the sweeper",Rabada to Yuvraj,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,19.2,"Rabada to Yuvraj, FOUR, too full and missed the yorker by a couple of inches, Yuvraj doesn't miss though, whipped it square and past the man at square leg. Boundaries flowing in the final part of the innings",Rabada to Yuvraj,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,19.5,"Rabada to Yuvraj, FOUR, sloppy! The low full toss outside off, Yuvraj was trying to slice it behind point, got it finer than he would have liked. Jayant at third man makes a meal of that. Allows it to escape past him",Rabada to Yuvraj,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,20.0,"Rabada to Yuvraj, FOUR, finishes the innings on a positive note. 19 runs off the over. Rabada went for 39 in his final two overs. You have to get the yorker spot on against Yuvraj. Slightly off and he puts it away, the bat comes down like an axe and he lofts it over Rabada, one bounce and into the fence",Rabada to Yuvraj,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,3.2,"Chris Morris to Dhawan, FOUR, similar delivery to the previous one and this time Morris pays the price, Dhawan is looking good today. The shots have been timed well. This time he's executed the cover-drive to perfection",Chris Morris to Dhawan,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,4.0,"Chris Morris to Dhawan, FOUR, now the bowler overcompensates by bowling short. There wasn't much of width on this one, but hopped and backed away slightly to create a bit of room and cut it away to the right of backward point",Chris Morris to Dhawan,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,4.2,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR, Warner knew that a slower ball was coming, backed away nicely to free the arms and slapped it hard over extra-cover for four. Easy pickings those",Rabada to Warner,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,5.1,"Shami to Warner, FOUR, slower ball, heaved away, no timing but it escapes for four. Another great start from this lovely SRH opening pair. Fifty comes up in 5.1 overs. This one was in the air, but wide of the man at mid-wicket",Shami to Warner,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,5.3,"Shami to Williamson, leg byes, FOUR, that's down the leg-side, Williamson misses the flick, the ball beats the keeper off the thigh pad and goes for four",Shami to Williamson,FOUR
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,6.0,"Shami to Dhawan, FOUR, Shami tries the slower ball bouncer, Dhawan does well to roll his wrists and control the hook shot, sends it past short fine leg",Shami to Dhawan,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,10.1,"SN Thakur to M Pandey, FOUR, whip of the wrists and off she went, one bounce four. Thakur is into his third over on the trot, full and angled into the pads, Pandey picks it over the mid-wicket fielder",SN Thakur to M Pandey,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,10.3,"SN Thakur to M Pandey, FOUR, third boundary of the over. Might be one over too many for Thakur. Short slower delivery and it sat up nicely for the swat from Pandey, he tonks it over mid-wicket and no one in the deep to stop that",SN Thakur to M Pandey,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,12.3,"Christian to M Pandey, FOUR, this time manages to elude the short third man fielder. Waits for the back of a length delivery to arrive, opens the bat face and delicately places it wide of Sundar",Christian to M Pandey,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,13.1,"Stokes to de Grandhomme, FOUR, the initial call from de Grandhomme was ""two"". Even he didn't know how well he had timed it. Full toss just outside off, which is caressed through extra cover. Rahane at sweeper had given up the chase quite early",Stokes to de Grandhomme,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,14.2,"Christian to de Grandhomme, FOUR, Christian has his hands on his head. He shouted ""catch it,"" but it was nowhere close to the fielder. Slower back of a length delivery, de Grandhomme punched it on the up and in the air, wide of extra cover and sweeper though",Christian to de Grandhomme,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,15.5,"Tahir to de Grandhomme, FOUR, not where he intended, but the final result is what he was looking for. Floated up outside off, de Grandhomme wanted to go over long-off, sliced over backward point and Sundar saw the ball balloon over him",Tahir to de Grandhomme,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,18.1,"Unadkat to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, sweep shot off a pacer. You don't see that often. The slower delivery and Suryakumar spotted it very early, went across his stumps and broomed it over short fine",Unadkat to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,18.2,"Unadkat to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, lovely shot! The off-pace delivery and Suryakumar is playing with Unadkat, makes room and lofts it inside out over extra cover, no chance for the long-off fielder to cut that",Unadkat to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,2.2,"Unadkat to Jackson, FOUR, makes room and does well by not going completely berserk with the shot. Had his eyes on the ball and slapped it past the man at backward point",Unadkat to Jackson,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,3.5,"Washington Sundar to Jackson, FOUR, Jackson skips down and does well with the loft. Did not appear to have given it everything. The focus was on the timing after he met the pitch of the ball. Lifted it pretty straight and fetched a four to the long-on fence",Washington Sundar to Jackson,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,4.4,"Stokes to Gambhir, FOUR, the way he had been caged, this was coming! Clears the front leg and swipes across the line, finding the gap through mid-wicket",Stokes to Gambhir,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,4.5,"Stokes to Gambhir, FOUR, consecutive fours for the skipper and this one is more classic. Goes back to this ball and tucks it fine after a hop in the crease. The ball races to the fine leg fence",Stokes to Gambhir,FOUR
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,5.3,"Washington Sundar to Gambhir, FOUR, that's so pleasing to watch. Moves aside to open up a bit and then goes inside out over cover. Races away",Washington Sundar to Gambhir,FOUR
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,0.2,"Coulter-Nile to Rahane, FOUR, Rahane is away. Sees the width and throws his bat, gets an outside edge that flies past first slip. Would've been gobbled up by second slip, if there was ever one",Coulter-Nile to Rahane,FOUR
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,1.3,"U Yadav to Rahane, FOUR, that's a quality shot from Rahane. A short of length delivery outside off, Rahane gets on top of it and thumps it over the infield on the off-side",U Yadav to Rahane,FOUR
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,11.2,"Narine to Tripathi, FOUR, slog-swept! Shabby fielding effort from Woakes at deep mid-wicket. Dives to his left, but doesn't stretch enough to flick the ball back",Narine to Tripathi,FOUR
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,2.2,"Coulter-Nile to Tripathi, FOUR, fabulous shot from Tripathi. Rides the bounce and cracks a solid punch that breaches the crowded off-side field. Races away to the fence",Coulter-Nile to Tripathi,FOUR
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,2.5,"Coulter-Nile to Tripathi, FOUR, NCN overcorrects and dishes out a full toss, Tripathi sets up a solid base and drills it past mid-on. Didn't get it off the middle but manages it thread it past the fielder",Coulter-Nile to Tripathi,FOUR
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,3.0,"Coulter-Nile to Tripathi, FOUR, 19 runs off the over. An expensive one for KKR. A short ball that sits up nicely for Tripathi, he spindles across and pulls it behind square. Goes all the way for a maximum",Coulter-Nile to Tripathi,FOUR
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,3.1,"U Yadav to Smith, byes, FOUR, ooh, almost did him there. Smith gives the charge to this back of a length delivery that shaped back in, aiming to open the up the off-side field. In the process, gets an inside edge that eludes a diving Jackson. The umpire fails to spot it and gives it as byes",U Yadav to Smith,FOUR
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,4.0,"U Yadav to Tripathi, FOUR, Tripathi is cutting loose here. Reads this leg-cutter early, flashes it hard and gets it over backward-point.",U Yadav to Tripathi,FOUR

2525767,RPS 1st Inns,6.0,"Coulter-Nile to Tripathi, FOUR, Tripathi is putting on a show here. He is 47 off just 18 balls. The short ball ain't working against him.

2525767,RPS 1st Inns,7.1,"Narine to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, Narine is greeted to the crease with a boundary. Deft from Tiwary, waits to the last moment and late cuts it to the third man fence. Almost fetched it from the keeper's gloves",Narine to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,8.0,"Narine to Tripathi, FOUR, Tripathi reaches fifty in style. Fastest individual fifty for RPS. Walks across his sticks, goes low and scoops it to the fine leg fence. Raises his bat and Tiwary embraces him",Narine to Tripathi,FOUR

Just extends his arms and steers it past the crowded off-side field",Sangwan to Nair,FOUR
2608816,DC 1st Inns,0.5,"Sangwan to Nair, FOUR, such minimal effort from Nair. Waits in his crease for this short of length delivery to arrive, uses his magical wrists and effortlessly pulls it over mid-wicket",Sangwan to Nair,FOUR
2608816,DC 1st Inns,10.1,"Faulkner to Pant, FOUR, oh dear. Ishan Kishan has defied the laws of living and walked through a ball at long leg. Or so it looked. Whipped off the pads, shipped away using the bottom hand and Kishan was charging in, and ran through",Faulkner to Pant,FOUR
2608816,DC 1st Inns,12.1,"Dwayne Smith to Pant, FOUR, as if the choice of bowling Smith wasn't enough, the bowlers chooses a full ball to bowl. Clattered over mid-wicket with a disparaging whip. Enough. No one in the deep",Dwayne Smith to Pant,FOUR
2608816,DC 1st Inns,13.0,"Dwayne Smith to Pant, FOUR, he's wound himself up brilliantly there. So brilliantly that he's taken a full ball on the stumps and whipped it over backward square leg, cleverly opening that side of the field by shuffling across early and getting into position. 44 off 42 and I see the unicorn already. Well, almost",Dwayne Smith to Pant,FOUR
2608816,DC 1st Inns,13.4,"Jadeja to Pant, FOUR, now this is a back foot punch over covers. You have to see it to believe it. Jadeja is from over the wicket to the left hander here. Just a touch short, Pant is so early there to get back and punch it up and over. Graceful, if it's ever been any more brutal",Jadeja to Pant,FOUR
2608816,DC 1st Inns,4.3,"Sangwan to Pant, FOUR, 16 off first 3 balls. Pant is on fire. Protracts his hands to this widish ball and cleverly guides it past short third man. Kotla breaks the sound barrier",Sangwan to Pant,FOUR
2608816,DC 1st Inns,8.3,"Raina to Pant, FOUR, clumsy from Smithy. Makes a royal mess of this one. Pant blasts it hard off the back foot through extra cover. Smithy gets across, slides near the ropes but lets it through his boot laces. Into the fence",Raina to Pant,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,0.1,"Nadeem to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, turn straightaway for Nadeem and he finds the outside edge. Smith was on the front foot to defend, the turn took the thick outside edge of the bat and it flew past the man at slip. The Lions are off the mark",Nadeem to Dwayne Smith,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,0.2,"Nadeem to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, that's swept away over backward square leg and it's four more. Turns out to be a good start for Smith and Gujarat. This was a delivery down the leg-side, Smith sweeps, gets a bit of top edge but he swung hard to send it over the infield",Nadeem to Dwayne Smith,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,11.5,"Nadeem to Raina, FOUR, the slog-sweep, in the air, but Raina has split the fielders in the deep. Deep mid-wicket and deep backward square leg thought they were in the business for a moment. Raina got down low on his knees and timed it well enough",Nadeem to Raina,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,13.1,"Shami to Karthik, FOUR, magnificent shot to start the over! Shami serves width outside off, Karthik leans forward and biffs the drive over Karun Nair at extra cover. Once it cleared him, there was none stopping that",Shami to Karthik,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,13.3,"Shami to Karthik, FOUR, shot! On the pads to any sub-continent batsman, he won't spare you. He moves slightly across and middles the leg-glance. The quick Delhi outfield does the rest",Shami to Karthik,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,14.0,"Shami to Finch, FOUR, 19 runs off the over! Finch is underway in a grand style. It was bowled on the stumps, but overpitched. Finch blasts the straight drive. The ball bullets away into the fence",Shami to Finch,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,17.0,"Rabada to Finch, FOUR, ah! Got to feel for the bowler. Finch was in no control of that shot, still gets a boundary. Quick short ball that keeps following Finch, who moved leg-side. The ball gets big on him. The batsman, with his eyes closed, goes for the pull. The ball pops up and flies wide of short fine and runs away into the fence",Rabada to Finch,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,17.5,"Pat Cummins to Finch, FOUR, that's a good shot! The batsman seemed to have been deceived by the short ball. He adjusted well, jumped and pulled fiercely through mid-wicket",Pat Cummins to Finch,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,18.2,"Rabada to Finch, FOUR, trademark Finch shot! Backs away and reaches for this fullish ball outside off. Carves it inside out over extra cover. Mid-off is up and there is none to stop that",Rabada to Finch,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,2.2,"Pat Cummins to Raina, FOUR, uppish, but not convincing. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, Raina chips it over the infield, more towards square leg, luckily for the visitors, the ball went in the gap",Pat Cummins to Raina,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,3.2,"Shami to Raina, FOUR, the short ball but Raina backed away early to free his arms. Slashed at it with an open bat face to deliberately hit over the top through point for four",Shami to Raina,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,3.4,"Shami to Raina, FOUR, this man is great with his inside-out lofted drives over the cover region. Can't really say that this is a bad ball from the bowler. Middle and leg line on a good length, Raina moved leg-side and played that easily over extra-cover",Shami to Raina,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,5.2,"Pat Cummins to Karthik, FOUR, that's a lovely piece of timing from Karthik. Should get him going. Not easy to jump down the pitch to a pacy bowler. In fact this came down at 148kph, Karthik made it into a fuller length by using his feet and played an excellent off-drive, the dive goes in vain from mid-off",Pat Cummins to Karthik,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,6.0,"Pat Cummins to Raina, FOUR, stylish from Raina. So after a terribly scratchy start, Raina has managed to settle nicely. Poor full delivery on the pads, deserved to be put away, Raina moved across the sticks just a touch to open up the backward square leg boundary and he placed the flick shot wide of the man at short fine to sign off the over in style",Pat Cummins to Raina,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,7.5,"Mishra to Karthik, FOUR, gee, what placement! Deliberately swung hard at it with an open bat face to send it through point. This was the googly from Mishra, making it a risky shot against the incoming ball, but the fact that it was too full made his life easy.",Mishra to Karthik,FOUR
2608816,GL 1st Inns,9.1,"Mishra to Karthik, FOUR, and Mishy continues to struggle against the right-hander, very strange through. He is so unwilling to toss the ball up and has hardly made Karthik play off the front foot. It's a short delivery that turns away, Karthik cuts well through point and beats the sweeper's dive on the boundary",Mishra to Karthik,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,1.2,"Aravind to Guptill, FOUR, this is one ground that he can make it big if he gets his eye in. The boundaries are short and even mishits can go all the way. Aravind bowled a fuller length and just outside off stump, Guptill lofted it over cover, didn't come from the middle of the bat, but good enough for a one-bounce four",Aravind to Guptill,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,1.5,"Aravind to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, wow! Lovely piece of timing. Aravind bowls full in search of swing, it did swing away a touch, but Marsh was nicely forward to cream the cover drive from the middle of the bat",Aravind to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,12.5,"Negi to Maxwell, FOUR, was that a drop? Negi is not a happy man. The reverse sweep from Maxi and he almost picked out backward point. Aniket is a tall man and he did get a fingertip on it. It was struck fiercely and Aniket did not have much time to react",Negi to Maxwell,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,13.1,"Chahal to Maxwell, byes, FOUR, what was Kedar Jadhav doing? Maxwell was beaten all ends up, tees off for a big mow to the leg-side, the ball goes on straight to beat him on the inside edge. Jadhav didn't even try to get his gloves behind the ball",Chahal to Maxwell,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,13.3,"Chahal to Maxwell, byes, FOUR, Kedar Jadhav is having a torrid time behind the wicket. Flighted just outside off, Maxwell drives and misses, he was undone by the lack of bounce and Jadhav is nutmegged. He should have had his legs together",Chahal to Maxwell,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,15.5,"Chahal to Axar, FOUR, good batting from Axar. A no risk shot this. Waited for the ball to arrive, used whatever pace was available and steered it fine, Badree had no chance at short third man",Chahal to Axar,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,16.4,"Aniket Choudhary to Saha, FOUR, Gayle at backward point and Badree at third man, you don't expect them to chase a ball down. Slower delivery and Saha relied on placing it behind point rather than knocking the cover off the ball. No chance for both the fielders",Aniket Choudhary to Saha,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,17.5,"Watson to Mohit Sharma, FOUR, bad delivery and deserved the treatment. Short and wide, Mohit threw the whole kitchen sink at that, sliced it off the outside edge to third man, got it fine enough and beat Aravind to the fence",Watson to Mohit Sharma,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,19.3,"Watson to Axar, FOUR, Axar seems to be having no problems on a surface where others have struggled. Short delivery on leg-stump, Axar pivots on his front leg and pulls it backward of square, couple of bounces and into the fence. 12 off the first three balls",Watson to Axar,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,19.4,"Watson to Axar, FOUR, turning out to be just the over KXIP needed. Kohli is furious at long-off. Kicks the ball back onto the ad boardings. Pitched up and Axar slams it straight down the ground. No chance for Kohli at long-off",Watson to Axar,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,4.1,"Watson to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, gee, how quickly did that reach the fence? Watson bowls a gentle full ball outside off stump, Marsh crashes it through cover and picks up a boundary",Watson to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,4.2,"Watson to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, that's lovely placement. No one at third man, he was actually inside the ring, so any width from the bowler is going to be easy, Marsh opened the bat face and nicely guided it past the man at 45",Watson to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,6.0,"Badree to Vohra, FOUR, oh this one kept low and it's very unlucky for the bowler that the ball has gone for four despite taking the inside edge of the bat. This was the slider on the shorter side, Vohra went back to pull, the ball didn't rise, went off the inner part and split short fine leg and backward square leg to perfection",Badree to Vohra,FOUR
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,0.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Kohli, FOUR, first ball. Shuffles and kills the inswing with a whippy clip, embarrassing us for all the bottom hand strength we don't have. Plays it real fine behind the wicket and gets a first-ball boundary to get off the mark",Sandeep Sharma to Kohli,FOUR
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,1.2,"T Natarajan to Mandeep, FOUR, this was half a cut at best. Jabbed the ball through covers. Natarajan angles this away, Singh stays put and caresses it away",T Natarajan to Mandeep,FOUR
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,1.3,"T Natarajan to Mandeep, FOUR, inside edge runs away. Had to shuffle here to get behind this ball angled away. Instead stays there and looks to fetch it, getting an inside edge much to keeper's left in the process",T Natarajan to Mandeep,FOUR
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,12.4,"Aaron to Negi, FOUR, skates down the pitch, stays leg-side of the delivery and carves Varun Aaron over extra cover. The batsman in Negi speaks...",Aaron to Negi,FOUR
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,14.3,"Aaron to Negi, FOUR, full and wide, Negi twitches his back knee and throws the kitchen sink, a big-blooded edge flies away to the third man fence",Aaron to Negi,FOUR
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,14.5,"Aaron to Negi, leg byes, FOUR, the rib-tickler. With fine leg inside the ring, not sure if that's a great idea. Negi hops and misses the tickle, the slow-low nature of the pitch means it shoots a bit low to take the thigh pad en route to fine leg fancy boards",Aaron to Negi,FOUR
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,3.4,"Aaron to Mandeep, FOUR, hence proven: Guptill has spring in his shoes. Hey ICC, are you watching? Cut but it's more off the edge, thanks to the bounce, and Guptill has almost gotten to it at backward point. Well almost. My commentary has been adulterated by my fanboyism, so maybe. But he really jumped there, and tumbling as he fell on the ground. Good to watch but Mandeep gets four runs here",Aaron to Mandeep,FOUR
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,4.2,"Sandeep Sharma to de Villiers, FOUR, goes full this ball and that's been smacked delightly, delicately through the other side of the wicket -- Sandeep is from over the wicket to AB here. Takes the ball on the up and disparages it away",Sandeep Sharma to de Villiers,FOUR
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,5.3,"Aaron to Mandeep, FOUR, good shot. Sees the length short and pulls it up and over the infield. Clears it easily for a boundary",Aaron to Mandeep,FOUR
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,6.0,"Aaron to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, what he's done here is ruled out Guptill at backward point. Hit it over him, and wide of him. Short and wide, talls up and cuts it ferociously. Powerplay done: 46 for 3",Aaron to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,9.1,"Mohit Sharma to Mandeep, FOUR, to be a cutter or to not be a cutter, that isn't the question. This was wide, and it's been cut away through backward point. Life's simple",Mohit Sharma to Mandeep,FOUR
4825658,RPS 1st Inns,13.3,"S Kaul to Stokes, FOUR, oh my word! You don't often see a batsman play the reverse-hit to a fast bowler. But Stokes does the unthinkable. Sees the short of length delivery early, changes his grip and swats it over point. Outrageous!",S Kaul to Stokes,FOUR
4825658,RPS 1st Inns,15.5,"S Kaul to Christian, FOUR, Christian is off the mark with a boundary. Would you believe it? This is only the second boundary of the innings. A juicy half volley outside off, Christian leans forward and creams it through extra cover",S Kaul to Christian,FOUR
4825658,RPS 1st Inns,17.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, a boundary to cap off the over. A short of length delivery outside off, Tiwary reaches out and places it behind point. No chance for the third man fielder",Bhuvneshwar to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR
4825658,RPS 1st Inns,18.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Dhoni, FOUR, bad idea Kumar. Arrows it on leg-stump line, Dhoni swivels 360 and hacks it over square leg",Bhuvneshwar to Dhoni,FOUR
4825658,RPS 1st Inns,19.2,"S Kaul to Dhoni, FOUR, such a calculative shot from Dhoni. Kaul angled this slower ball outside off, Dhoni throws his bat to his fullest and gets it over point. Not off the middle but he won't mind",S Kaul to Dhoni,FOUR
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,0.4,"Unadkat to Dhawan, FOUR, lovely shot, poor ball from Unadkat, short and wide of off, Dhawan reached out and cracks it in front of square on the off-side. Rahane moved across to his left, put in the dive, but the ball was always wide of him",Unadkat to Dhawan,FOUR
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,1.0,"Unadkat to Dhawan, FOUR, Dhawan has come out aggressively. Someone might have told him that the Indian team for Champions Trophy might be selected tomorrow. Unadkat shortened the length as he spotted Dhawan running down the track, makes room and slaps it over cover. Rahane has no chance in the deep",Unadkat to Dhawan,FOUR
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,11.1,"Christian to Warner, FOUR, calculated risk from Warner. First ball from a new bowler, mid-off inside the ring and Warner was walking down the pitch, extends his arms and lifts it over the fielder, couple of bounces and into the fence",Christian to Warner,FOUR
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,15.2,"Tahir to Yuvraj, FOUR, that is cricket. A chance off the last ball followed by a boundary. Flighted delivery on a fullish length, righth in the arc for Yuvraj, who heaves it to the deep mid-wicket fence. Placed it expertly",Tahir to Yuvraj,FOUR
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,4.2,"Stokes to Williamson, FOUR, edged and four, a juicy full-toss from Stokes, might have slipped out of his hands. Williamson was startled as he pushed at that, gets a thick edge that rolls away past the keeper and into the fence. An immediate apology from Stokes, but that wasn't dangerous",Stokes to Williamson,FOUR
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,5.0,"Stokes to Yuvraj, FOUR, a gift and Yuvraj gleefully accepts! Short and wide from Stokes, Yuvraj climbs into the cut and deposits it over cover, a couple of bounces and the ball rolls into the ad hoarding",Stokes to Yuvraj,FOUR
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,5.3,"Washington Sundar to Warner, FOUR, that's a good comeback from Warner, tossed up on the stumps, he gets down low and sweeps it over square leg, no need to run for those",Washington Sundar to Warner,FOUR
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,5.5,"Washington Sundar to Warner, FOUR, lovely, Warner is getting into the act now, slower and just outside off, he gets forward, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and finds the gap past extra-cover, beats mid-off and rolls away to the fence",Washington Sundar to Warner,FOUR
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,6.0,"Washington Sundar to Warner, FOUR, cracking shot, this is good batting from Warner, he's beginning to read Sundar now, tossed up on the stumps, he gets well forward and lifts it back over the bowler's head, one bounce and over the ropes",Washington Sundar to Warner,FOUR
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,8.3,"SN Thakur to Yuvraj, FOUR, edged and four, more luck for Yuvraj, full and wide of off from Shardul. Yuvraj saw the width and threw his hands at that, gets a thick edge that flies past Dhoni and into the fence",SN Thakur to Yuvraj,FOUR
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,9.0,"SN Thakur to Yuvraj, FOUR, creamed, width on offer from Shardul, Yuvraj leans into the shot and drives it to the left of extra-cover. It was in the air but was perfectly placed as well, no chance for the fielder at mid-off",SN Thakur to Yuvraj,FOUR
9316064,DC 1st Inns,2.3,"McClenaghan to Nair, FOUR, cheeky and effective. Makes a bit of room to this shortish ball that was going across him, guides it over the slip fielder, who is fairly wide. Third man too is in the ring",McClenaghan to Nair,FOUR
9316064,DC 1st Inns,2.4,"McClenaghan to Nair, FOUR, the swipe that Delhi batsmen have been attempting to no avail. But this time he has got a bit of bat on it. The delivery was slower than usual, might have helped his cause. Hits over mid-wicket and fetches a four",McClenaghan to Nair,FOUR
9316064,DC 1st Inns,4.0,"Bumrah to Nair, FOUR, wickets are tumbling at one end but Nair continues to impress. Arches back to this short ball and ramps it over the keeper. A couple of bounces and into the fence",Bumrah to Nair,FOUR
9316064,DC 1st Inns,4.1,"Harbhajan to Corey Anderson, FOUR, starts round the wicket and gets it to turn a bit around off. Corey Anderson goes back to cut, the ball keeps a bit low and takes the under edge. Goes between the legs of Parthiv. Bumrah, from short fine leg, gives the chase for a while before the ball beats him to the fence",Harbhajan to Corey Anderson,FOUR
9316064,DC 1st Inns,5.2,"Malinga to Corey Anderson, FOUR, drags the mighty heave from around off. For a moment he seemed to have found mid-wicket. But it was in the gap between mid-wicket and mid-on",Malinga to Corey Anderson,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,12.4,"Corey Anderson to Rohit, FOUR, beautifully played! This was a back of a length delivery outside off, Rohit waits on it, uses the pace on the ball and dabbed it behind square on the off-side. Backward point dived to his left, short third man to his right - but both can't stop the ball",Corey Anderson to Rohit,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,14.5,"Zaheer to Pollard, FOUR, Pollard gets way with another slice of luck. He came down the track, set himself up for the lap sweep, Zaheer spotted it and went wider, finds the outside edge and it loops past Pant. Can't do much as a bowler in this format of the game",Zaheer to Pollard,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,15.1,"Rabada to Pollard, FOUR, full marks for effort from Iyer, but he could not stop the boundary. Length delivery on off, Pollard heaved and the inside edge squirted towards fine leg. Iyer ran across from deep square and dived, but the ball won the race",Rabada to Pollard,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,17.0,"Pat Cummins to Pollard, FOUR, fifty for Pollard. The move has paid off. He raises his bat and acknowledges the applause from his team mates. He shouldn't have been on strike for this ball. The basics in cricket I tell you. Low full toss and Pollard drills it past mid-off. No stopping that",Pat Cummins to Pollard,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,18.0,"Corey Anderson to Pollard, FOUR, good finish to the over. Anderson misses the yorker by a couple of inches and that is enough for Pollard to tonk it back over him, one bounce and evades the long-on fielder",Corey Anderson to Pollard,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,19.1,"Pat Cummins to Pollard, FOUR, lovely batting. Low full toss outside off, not far from the yorker, Pollard is deep in the crease, opens the bat face and drives through extra cover. No chance for the sweeper",Pat Cummins to Pollard,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,19.3,"Pat Cummins to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, this was not the area Hardik was targeting. He was looking to go over extra cover, but the bat turned on impact and the length delivery was sliced over backward point",Pat Cummins to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,3.0,"Zaheer to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, that's a poor ball, spoils the over for Zaheer. Down the leg-side, the cutter gone wrong. Parthiv Patel helps the pull past the man in the ring at short fine leg",Zaheer to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,3.4,"Rabada to Simmons, FOUR, now he is playing with the mind of Rabada. It's a short ball, gives himself some room and slaps over cover-point",Rabada to Simmons,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,5.2,"Pat Cummins to Simmons, FOUR, that's as Caribbean as anything. Clears the left-leg and slaps this length ball over cover",Pat Cummins to Simmons,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,5.4,"Pat Cummins to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, how far has that gone. Far enough but bounces just inside the ropes. Parthiv Patel took on the short ball and went for the hook, hitting it high and almost handsome. One bounce over the ropes at deep backwars square leg fence",Pat Cummins to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,5.5,"Pat Cummins to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, Parthiv Patel is giving it all. Backs away to this fuller ball and slices it past the ring, races to the third man fence",Pat Cummins to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,6.0,"Pat Cummins to Parthiv Patel, leg byes, FOUR, Cummins switches to round the wicket to finish the over. Does not bring about a change in fortunes, drifts down the leg and Parthiv Patel helps it past the keeper. In fact between the keeper and the man at short fine leg with a whippish pull. That is what I saw, the umpire saw things differently and correctly. Given as leg-byes, must have come off thigh or something else",Pat Cummins to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,7.1,"Shami to Simmons, FOUR, shortish ball. Bad ball to start off the over. Might have been warming up. Simmons makes full use of it, cuts past the man at backward point",Shami to Simmons,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,7.4,"Shami to Simmons, FOUR, he is cracking those off the back foot. And the length from Shami is not helping the cause of Delhi. Bit of width, Simmons creates some more and cuts it past the man at point",Shami to Simmons,FOUR
9316064,MI 1st Inns,9.4,"Shami to Simmons, FOUR, he is not going to budge, this man who beats jetlags. Clears the front leg and hits it flat over mid-off, one bounce and over the ropes",Shami to Simmons,FOUR
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,0.2,"Aniket Choudhary to Chris Lynn, FOUR, Lynn is off. Sheer timing fetches him his first boundary. Fuller and just outside off, Lynn drives through the line and the timing take care of the rest. There was a fielder in the deep and he had no chance",Aniket Choudhary to Chris Lynn,FOUR
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,0.3,"Aniket Choudhary to Chris Lynn, FOUR, drilled. Aniket pitches it up and is dispatched with disdain. Lynn does not bother to move his feet and hammers the drive past a hapless AB at mid-off",Aniket Choudhary to Chris Lynn,FOUR
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,1.3,"Badree to Narine, FOUR, in the air and over short third. Narine shimmies down and Badree pushed it wide, the outside edge flies towards Aniket, who misjudged it slightly by moving in and by the time he tracked back, the ball was over him",Badree to Narine,FOUR
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,10.3,"Negi to de Grandhomme, FOUR, shortish outside off, and it's been slapped to the point boundary. What's Mandeep done to himself here? He charged across from sweeper cover and put in the dive. Valiant but futile effort. Looks in some pain. He's fine",Negi to de Grandhomme,FOUR
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,2.2,"Chahal to Chris Lynn, FOUR, that length is not going to trouble Lynn or for that matter any batsman. Short and on off, Lynn makes a bit of room and cracks it in front of square, raced away to the fence",Chahal to Chris Lynn,FOUR
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,3.0,"Chahal to Chris Lynn, FOUR, excellent batting. He is intimidating the bowlers here. Chahal is not tossing them up now, Lynn stays on the back foot and thumps it past the diving extra cover fielder",Chahal to Chris Lynn,FOUR
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,3.4,"Badree to Narine, FOUR, now this is rubbish. Rank long hop and down leg as well, Narine helps it along the way with a pull over short fine, this is just brilliant batting from the duo",Badree to Narine,FOUR
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,4.2,"Aravind to Narine, FOUR, wow! This is some hitting. Fullish and outside off, Narine nonchalantly lofts it inside out over extra cover, the ball almost carried the distance. One bounce and into the fence",Aravind to Narine,FOUR
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,4.3,"Aravind to Narine, FOUR, the runs seem to be coming thick and fast. KKR want to finish this early so we can start the second game on time. Back of a length and outside off, Narine slaps it past mid-off. Not where he intended but the end result is what matters",Aravind to Narine,FOUR
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,4.4,"Aravind to Narine, FOUR, full toss, come on you have to do better than that. Narine stands his ground and heaves it over mid-wicket, no one in the deep to stop that. Can he record the fastest fifty this season?",Aravind to Narine,FOUR
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,5.0,"Aravind to Narine, FOUR, fullish and outside off, Narine slices it over the infield. The carnage continues. Aravind just doesn't know where to bowl to Narine and he concedes 26 runs in the over",Aravind to Narine,FOUR
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,5.2,"Chahal to Chris Lynn, FOUR, short and outside off, Lynn slaps it over the off-side ring. No need to run for those when you keep striking them like that. This is simply brilliant batting from the duo",Chahal to Chris Lynn,FOUR
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,1.5,"Woakes to Mandeep, FOUR, nice way to get going, banged in short and just outside off, Mandeep backs away, comes down the track and slaps it high and behind square on the off-side. Almost went all the way, one bounce and over the ropes",Woakes to Mandeep,FOUR
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,12.0,"Rajpoot to Head, FOUR, that ruins the over for Rajpoot, much needed boundary for RCB. Too short and on Head's hips, he gets inside the line and helps it on its way. Fine-leg was inside the ring and once it beat him, there was no way it could be stopped",Rajpoot to Head,FOUR
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,14.1,"de Grandhomme to Mandeep, FOUR, good shot! Just used the pace of de Grandhomme and guided it behind point, opened the bat face at the right moment and bisected the two fielders to perfection",de Grandhomme to Mandeep,FOUR
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,17.0,"Woakes to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, Jadhav is too good with those pick ups. Sees the back of a length delivery around the hip region, Jadhav maintains a strong base and swats it behind square on the leg-side, no chance for deep square leg",Woakes to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,19.2,"U Yadav to Negi, FOUR, wow! Was that the outfield or the power of Negi? Bit of both I reckon. Too full and outside off, Negi reaches out for the drive and almost jammed it through extra cover. The ball kept going away from the long-off fielder",U Yadav to Negi,FOUR
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,2.2,"U Yadav to Mandeep, FOUR, cracking shot, Mandeep is finally showing the form that made him a possible India selection a couple of seasons ago.

4967787,RCB 1st Inns,20.0,"U Yadav to Head, FOUR, ends the innings on a high. The slowest of slower balls from Umesh. Took a while getting to Head, he waited for a long time before pulling it over the square leg umpire. Since there was no pace, the ball didn't travel the distance",U Yadav to Head,FOUR
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,4.0,"Woakes to de Villiers, FOUR, cracking shot, AB gets going, Woakes shortened his length as he saw AB's charge. Quick hands does the trick for the Protean superstar, swivels across, rolls his wrists over and pulls it in front of square on the on-side, beats the man getting across from the deep",Woakes to de Villiers,FOUR
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,4.3,"Narine to de Villiers, FOUR, classy, that's why he's the best in the business, Narine dropped his length short and wide outside off, AB was shuffling across, adjusts well and slaps it over cover, one bounce and over the ropes",Narine to de Villiers,FOUR
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,5.5,"U Yadav to Head, FOUR, lovely shot, leg-stump half-volley from Umesh, Head shuffles across and whips it in front of square on the on-side. The man in the deep is very square and has no chance",U Yadav to Head,FOUR

6360325,GL 1st Inns,1.1,"Mohit Sharma to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, leg-side dross. Smith won't spare. He clips it behind square, so far that the man at deep square couldn't reach",Mohit Sharma to Dwayne Smith,FOUR
6360325,GL 1st Inns,1.3,"Mohit Sharma to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, slower half-volley outside off, Smith gets to the pitch of it and thrashes it away between mid-off and extra cover. Simple",Mohit Sharma to Dwayne Smith,FOUR
6360325,GL 1st Inns,10.0,"T Natarajan to Raina, FOUR, full toss on legs. Raina helps it to the deep backward square leg fence. Horrible ball, overheard in the comm room",T Natarajan to Raina,FOUR
6360325,GL 1st Inns,10.5,"Aaron to Raina, FOUR, Raina makes room, gets followed by a short ball but does not flinch. Goes with the pull - tennis-like heave - and sends it to the deep mid-wicket fence on the bounce",Aaron to Raina,FOUR
6360325,GL 1st Inns,11.0,"Aaron to Raina, FOUR, and gets this one fine. Shuffled across to a short ball and tucked in the air, but fine leg was not in the ring. Managed to fetch a four in the end",Aaron to Raina,FOUR
6360325,GL 1st Inns,14.1,"T Natarajan to Raina, FOUR, steps down does Raina this time. Natarajan wants to out-think him with a slower short ball. Fails. Raina cuts him to the deep point fence",T Natarajan to Raina,FOUR

6360325,GL 1st Inns,19.4,"T Natarajan to Karthik, FOUR, slower ball and Karthik lofts over extra cover. No one in the deep and it just about trickles down to the fence. All over. GL win by 6 wickets",T Natarajan to Karthik,FOUR
6360325,GL 1st Inns,2.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, trying too much? I guess so. Looks for swing again, there's none. Sat up from a short length, Smith punches sweetly through the covers. Save your legs!",Sandeep Sharma to Dwayne Smith,FOUR
6360325,GL 1st Inns,3.3,"Aaron to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, shortens the length and takes the pace off, Smith had the width to free his arms and he delays the cut shot, that helped him place in the gap on the off-side ring",Aaron to Dwayne Smith,FOUR
6360325,GL 1st Inns,3.4,"Aaron to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, looks to tuck a length ball in the air over mid-wicket, gets a thick leading edge which lobs up and rolls towards third man. Sandeep Sharma tried his best, but he ended up parrying the ball into the boundary boards",Aaron to Dwayne Smith,FOUR

6360325,GL 1st Inns,7.1,"Maxwell to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, nothing seems to be working. Starts with a short ball, Ishan Kishan camps back and pulls through mid-wicket",Maxwell to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
6360325,GL 1st Inns,7.3,"Maxwell to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, how good a shot that is. Look at the placement. Ishan Kishan charges on the front foot, sees the length and shapes back, cuts and beats the man at point and then sweeper who ran to his right",Maxwell to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
6360325,KXIP 1st Inns,10.0,"Faulkner to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, full and down the leg-side, Marsh easily glances it past short fine leg, Ishan Kishan runs to his left in the deep and dives but the ball wins the race",Faulkner to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
6360325,KXIP 1st Inns,11.1,"Faulkner to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, 112kph slower ball, but you can't offer width with both backward point and third man inside the ring. Marsh delays the late cut and guides it nicely between the two fielders",Faulkner to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
6360325,KXIP 1st Inns,14.1,"Basil Thampi to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, that's Marsh's strength. He is so good with the cut shots. Just can't keep him calm by bowling it wide of off, plants his back foot deep and thumps it away past backward point",Basil Thampi to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
6360325,KXIP 1st Inns,16.5,"Basil Thampi to Amla, FOUR, oh Amla! You bewdy! He was shaping up to scoop over the keeper, on seeing the yorker dip he stays still and slaps it off the face over short third, all wrists you know. He might have borrowed VVS' wrists. Seriously! Never seen someone scoring so many runs at ease with pure wristwork",Basil Thampi to Amla,FOUR
6360325,KXIP 1st Inns,17.0,"Basil Thampi to Amla, FOUR, width on offer, Amla charges himself for another flay, goes deep and carves it away over point",Basil Thampi to Amla,FOUR

6360325,KXIP 1st Inns,2.4,"Sangwan to Amla, FOUR, that's class for you. The off-side is packed and Amla nonchalantly walks across the stumps, tempts the bowler to bowl at the stumps, Sangwan delivers a slower ball, Amla had ample time to flick along the ground, made sure he placed it well wide of deep square leg",Sangwan to Amla,FOUR
6360325,KXIP 1st Inns,2.5,"Sangwan to Amla, FOUR, this time he clears the off-side field. Slower delivery outside off stump, Amla leans forward, delays his punch and hits it along the ground through cover",Sangwan to Amla,FOUR
6360325,KXIP 1st Inns,4.5,"Basil Thampi to Amla, FOUR, now that is a top shot! The change of pace, but Amla has great eyes. Picked that from the bowler's hand, delayed his shot, opened up the front leg and used his wrists so well to lift it inside-out over cover",Basil Thampi to Amla,FOUR
6360325,KXIP 1st Inns,5.5,"Faulkner to Amla, FOUR, that is pure wrist power. This was the slower ball, but it went too full, meaning that the batsman had a bit of extra time to react, Amla flicked nicely along the ground through mid-wicket",Faulkner to Amla,FOUR
6360325,KXIP 1st Inns,6.5,"Jadeja to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, and again. As soon as Marsh comes on strike, Jadeja forgets words like ""flight, air-time, tossing."" MS Dhoni has to be behind the stumps to give him advice when he is under pressure. This is a big outfield and maybe he need not be afraid to toss a ball up. It's flat, quick, short, Marsh pulls it nicely past the deep mid-wicket fielder",Jadeja to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
6360325,KXIP 1st Inns,7.5,"Ankit Soni to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, it's a full toss, the idea was there to give the ball a bit more air, but the execution wasn't great. Marsh doesn't try to over-hit the ball, places the flick between long-on and deep mid-wicket",Ankit Soni to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
6360325,KXIP 1st Inns,8.1,"Jadeja to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, Jadeja continues to bowl quick, errs in line once again. Down the leg-side, Marsh glances it fine past the man at 45",Jadeja to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
4724289,MI 1st Inns,12.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit, FOUR, this time he gets a boundary! Shortish and wide outside off, Rohit throws the kitchen sink, gets a fat outside edge that flies through the gap between backward point and short third man. There is no one to stop that",Bhuvneshwar to Rohit,FOUR
4724289,MI 1st Inns,13.1,"Henriques to Rohit, FOUR, wow! Stupendous shot. Henriques starts with an 117kph half-volley outside off, Rohit spots it like a hawk, waits for it and drills it through the covers. There was a man in the deep, all he could do was watch it go past the boundary rope",Henriques to Rohit,FOUR
4724289,MI 1st Inns,13.4,"Henriques to Rohit, FOUR, this is turning out to be an expensive over. Length ball outside off, Rohit doesn't go hard on his drive. Gets it wide of extra cover and the long-off fielder can't cut it off either",Henriques to Rohit,FOUR
4724289,MI 1st Inns,13.5,"Henriques to Rohit, FOUR, four more, third boundary in this over. Deft touch from the MI skipper. Waits for the ball to arrive to him and cheekily opens the bat face at the last instance to guide it well wide of the short third man fielder. The ball dribbles away into the fence",Henriques to Rohit,FOUR
4724289,MI 1st Inns,16.0,"Siraj to Rohit, FOUR, cheeky and effective. Short ball aimed at the body of Rohit. The batsman waited for it, slightly bends backward and periscopes it over the keeper's head for a boundary",Siraj to Rohit,FOUR
4724289,MI 1st Inns,19.0,"S Kaul to Karn Sharma, FOUR, ah! Boundary to finish the over. Still, just six off it.

4724289,MI 1st Inns,2.4,"Siraj to Nitish Rana, FOUR, now then, now then, how about that for placement? What confidence to play such a shot when he has not even scored a run. Third man was inside the ring, Rana spotted that, as soon as he saw room on the ball, Rana guided it late and split short third man and backward point to perfection",Siraj to Nitish Rana,FOUR
4724289,MI 1st Inns,2.5,"Siraj to Nitish Rana, FOUR, overpitched from Siraj, the over-correction from the bowler, Rana leans forward and plays a lovely off-drive to the left of mid-off",Siraj to Nitish Rana,FOUR
4724289,MI 1st Inns,5.2,"Nabi to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, this is a brave hit and well executed too. Flighted delivery wide outside off stump, Parthiv was down on one knee and he had to fetch that shot, extended his arms and slog-swept it nicely into the deep mid-wicket boundary",Nabi to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4724289,MI 1st Inns,8.3,"Rashid Khan to Rohit, FOUR, deft touch from the skipper. Quicker delivery outside off stump, Rohit allows the ball to come, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and sends it to the left of short third man",Rashid Khan to Rohit,FOUR
4724289,SRH 1st Inns,0.2,"Harbhajan to Warner, FOUR, short and wide outside off stump, Warner delayed the cut shot as the ball came slowly, hit that really hard through cover-point. He wants to make the most of the new ball",Harbhajan to Warner,FOUR
4724289,SRH 1st Inns,10.4,"Malinga to Henriques, FOUR, a full toss now. Henriques rides his luck with a dish out of some elegant timing. Executes a short arm jab to whip it in the air through mid-wicket",Malinga to Henriques,FOUR
4724289,SRH 1st Inns,10.5,"Malinga to Henriques, FOUR, and the mid-wicket fence is disturbed again. This time courtesy a standing up pull.

4724289,SRH 1st Inns,13.4,"McClenaghan to Yuvraj, FOUR, breaks the shackles. Gets a short one on the ribs and an angry swivelling pull comes out in spanking it into the square leg fence. Hides his pain under some runs",McClenaghan to Yuvraj,FOUR
4724289,SRH 1st Inns,18.2,"Bumrah to Vijay Shankar, FOUR, that's that. A juicy length delivery right in the slot and Shankar swings it over mid-on.

4724289,SRH 1st Inns,4.5,"Bumrah to Dhawan, FOUR. The Gabbar is so good with the pull shot. Picks the length early and slots it all along the carpet through mid-wicket, too much to do for deep square, he couldn't get there in time",Bumrah to Dhawan,FOUR
4724289,SRH 1st Inns,5.2,"McClenaghan to Henriques, FOUR, that's too much width and can't expect to get away by bowling such fodder. Henriques uses McClenaghan's pace to slash it away through backward point",McClenaghan to Henriques,FOUR
4724289,SRH 1st Inns,7.3,"Hardik Pandya to Henriques, FOUR, smash-me delivery. No real intent on that delivery. It just kept arrowing down the leg-side, Henriques helps it to the fine leg fence with a real muscular pull",Hardik Pandya to Henriques,FOUR
4724289,SRH 1st Inns,8.0,"Hardik Pandya to Henriques, FOUR, width on the off-side to the right hander this time, Henriques has no second thoughts, he stays his ground and cuts fiercely square on the off-side",Hardik Pandya to Henriques,FOUR
4724289,SRH 1st Inns,8.1,"Karn Sharma to Dhawan, FOUR, down on one knee and he goes boom on the sweep. Gets inside the line and picks his gap through backward square, timed well too",Karn Sharma to Dhawan,FOUR
4724289,SRH 1st Inns,9.2,"Harbhajan to Dhawan, FOUR, precision at its very best! Call it luck or placement, but Dhawan and SRH won't mind. Attempts the reverse sweep and for a fleeting moment he seemed to have mistimed it, but such is the luck, it flies in the gap between short third and backward point",Harbhajan to Dhawan,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,0.1,"Sandeep Sharma to Narine, FOUR, and that is an usual sight. Sandeep Sharma throws it full outside off, might have swung a bit. But how does it matter, Narine flays the drive uppishly through cover",Sandeep Sharma to Narine,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,0.2,"Sandeep Sharma to Narine, FOUR, back to back now! Another fuller ball and Narine this time lofts the drive, not much of followthrough. Just an extension of elbow and off she goes, one bounce over the ropes at extra cover",Sandeep Sharma to Narine,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,0.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Chris Lynn, FOUR, swings a bit outside off. Chris Lynn takes that into account, clears the leg and cracks the drive over cover",Sandeep Sharma to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,1.1,"Matt Henry to Chris Lynn, FOUR, Henry might have had a wicket off the first ball this season. But the wicket-keeper and the slip fielder both are undecided. Nobody went for it. Length delivery and Chris Lynn goes hard at it, outside edges that flies between the two men behind the stumps",Matt Henry to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,1.4,"Matt Henry to Chris Lynn, FOUR, Henry's pacy puts Chris Lynn in tangle once again but there is no one at fine leg. The man is in the ring. Chris Lynn was hurried by the bumper and top edged the pull. And because he throws his bat so hard, these edges fly over the ring",Matt Henry to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,13.5,"Rahul Tewatia to M Pandey, FOUR, geez, I have jinxed it, haven't I? Has the readymade room made and mows it off the front foot, right between long-on and deep mid-wicket",Rahul Tewatia to M Pandey,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,17.0,"Mohit Sharma to Chris Lynn, FOUR, the partnership between Chris Lynn and M Pandey is now 50+. Mohit caps the over with a poor, poor ball. Overpitches at his normal pace - must have been about 135kmph - and Lynn flays him back over his head. The shot was on. Andcredit to Lynn for reading the change of pace, for Sharma was on the slower side for all the over but this. 37 off the last 3",Mohit Sharma to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,18.0,"Matt Henry to de Grandhomme, FOUR, slightly slower in the early 130s and de Grandhomme has picked him. Slices it square on the off-side and manages to place it wide of the deep point fielder. 29 off the last two",Matt Henry to de Grandhomme,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,2.2,"Sandeep Sharma to Chris Lynn, FOUR, there's a long on this time but it has gone too straight. Sandeep Sharma once again teases his luck with a fuller ball. Chris Lynn, who was backing away, on-drives this one with a loft. Finds the fence with ease",Sandeep Sharma to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,3.2,"Mohit Sharma to Narine, FOUR, slower ball but Narine waits, as if he knew what was coming, and drives uppishly over extra cover. Not off the middle but does the job for him",Mohit Sharma to Narine,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,3.3,"Mohit Sharma to Narine, FOUR, the best we have seen so far? Maybe! Is making room to this length ball, the length is just short of a length and hence decides to play a straight-bat punch. Times it well to beat mid-off to his right",Mohit Sharma to Narine,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,4.1,"Axar to Chris Lynn, FOUR, Axar throws it wide outside off. Chris Lynn keeps his front leg out of the equation and drives to the deep cover fence",Axar to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,4.2,"Axar to Chris Lynn, FOUR, has to wait a bit as the length is a touch shorter. Cuts and finds the gap past a diving extra cover, another four",Axar to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7153825,KKR 1st Inns,5.3,"Matt Henry to Chris Lynn, FOUR, only with a man of steel-forearms can do it. Short ball outside off, Chris Lynn is committed on the pull but the ball does not quite come with pace. He does not flinch, goes with the pull and fetches it from outside off, almost clears the fence at deep mid-wicket",Matt Henry to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,0.4,"U Yadav to Guptill, FOUR, first boundary of the evening. A loose ball down leg, Guptill moves across slightly and nudges it very fine into the fine leg fence",U Yadav to Guptill,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,12.2,"Rajpoot to Saha, FOUR, the edges too come in. Ah, unfair. Rajpoot bumps it in, gets it at the perfect nagging height and Saha's compulsive pull gets the top edge flying over the keeper. You cannot stop these",Rajpoot to Saha,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,12.5,"Rajpoot to Maxwell, FOUR, piles it on. With the width not enough to force matters in the off-side, Maxwell takes it into the other side of the pitch. Another back of a length this from Rajpoot looking to cramp him up for room and responded with a flat bat this time. Barely bothers to keep it down either, gets it in front of the man looking to cut it off at mid-wicket",Rajpoot to Maxwell,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,14.3,"Narine to Saha, FOUR, too short. Too wide. Further amplified by Saha backing away violently. Waits on the ball to get close and slaps it through the covers",Narine to Saha,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,18.4,"Woakes to Rahul Tewatia, FOUR, for some reason switches to a half volley. Tewatia, waits, buries and meets it with a full-blooded lofted drive through extra cover",Woakes to Rahul Tewatia,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,18.5,"Woakes to Rahul Tewatia, FOUR, spots the slower off-cutter. And ensures to dispatch it away. Tries to fox him with the loopy bouncer here does Woakes but a walk across to pull it past the man at short fine does the job",Woakes to Rahul Tewatia,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,19.5,"Rajpoot to Rahul Tewatia, FOUR, hunts the fence. Much needed this for the Punjabis. Takes it off the pads and brings out the broom as he sweeps it this away",Rajpoot to Rahul Tewatia,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,3.2,"Narine to Vohra, FOUR, doesn't get away this time. Seam up delivery from a shortish length, Vohra punches it handsomely through the covers. Finds the gap and the ball races away",Narine to Vohra,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,3.3,"Narine to Vohra, FOUR, cheeky and effective. Uses the slightest of widths outside off and opens his bat face to guide it wide of the keeper into the third man fence",Narine to Vohra,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,4.2,"U Yadav to Vohra, FOUR, slower delivery and Vohra takes full toll of it. The attemped leg-break ends up right in the slot for Vohra. The batsman jogs down and heaves it over mid-wicket for a boundary",U Yadav to Vohra,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,4.4,"U Yadav to Vohra, FOUR, wow! Superb shot. Vohra spots the slower delivery well outside off and carves it over point. There is none stopping that",U Yadav to Vohra,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,7.5,"de Grandhomme to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, ah! Streaky, Marsh won't mind though. Seam-up delivery on a short of length, probably kept a tad low. Marsh wanted to work it through the on-side and gets an inside edge that eludes the leg pole and dribbles away into the fine leg fence",de Grandhomme to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,8.0,"de Grandhomme to Shaun Marsh, FOUR, that's textbook stuff from Shaun Marsh. Half-volley just outside off, Marsh leans forward and middles the straight-drive. That's Instagrammable",de Grandhomme to Shaun Marsh,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,0.1,"D Kulkarni to Samson, FOUR, that's as minimal footwork as you'd get, and the ball has sped to the boundary at the rate of knots. What timing. What a start. Shows you how good a pitch this is as well. Back of a length from Kulkarni, curling away a touch outside off, and Samson just caresses it from the crease through the covers",D Kulkarni to Samson,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,1.2,"Sangwan to Samson, FOUR, full again, but too much width on this occasion and Samson roundhouses it to the cover boundary. Just lashed at the ball and got it away through the ring",Sangwan to Samson,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,1.4,"Sangwan to Pant, FOUR, first ball and he's away. We've seen that before from Pant this season. Isn't shy to take the bowler on, even as early as his first ball. Picks length quickly, and swats it through mid-wicket off the front foot. Dismissive",Sangwan to Pant,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,10.1,"Jadeja to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, flat and wide outside off, Iyer waits for it on the back foot and cuts it behind square on the off-side. Runs away to the fence and that brings up his fifty",Jadeja to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,11.3,"Basil Thampi to Corey Anderson, FOUR, that should ease his nerves. Slightest of widths outside off and Anderson opens his bat face at the point of impact and punches it through square on the off-side",Basil Thampi to Corey Anderson,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,12.0,"Basil Thampi to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, Thampi throws it wide outside off, Iyer forces it behind square on the off-side and the ball races away towards the fence. The man in the deep isn't sharp to stop that",Basil Thampi to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,12.2,"Jadeja to Brathwaite, FOUR, wow! Easily done! Brathwaite gets low on one knee and laps it away into the fine leg fence",Jadeja to Brathwaite,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,12.5,"Jadeja to Brathwaite, FOUR, was there bat involved? The ump thinks so. The premeditated shot fetches Brathwaite a boundary. It was fired outside off, Brathwaite reverses his stance and tries to play the reverse sweep. Probably, there was a bit of wood on it. DK can't stop it and there no one else to stop that from reaching the fence",Jadeja to Brathwaite,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,14.1,"Sangwan to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, four to start the over. Iyer backs away, creates room and hammers this length ball from round the wicket through the covers. Thampi, in the deep, dives and makes a mess of it",Sangwan to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,14.2,"Sangwan to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, four more! Once again, Iyer moves leg-side, opens up the off-side and cuts it fiercely behind square on the off-side",Sangwan to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,14.5,"Sangwan to Pat Cummins, FOUR, good shot to open your account. He relied more on power than timing. Clears the front leg and hammers a length ball through extra cover",Sangwan to Pat Cummins,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,15.0,"Sangwan to Pat Cummins, FOUR, wow! DD are still in this game. Sangwan angles it on a length, Cummins moves slightly leg-side and flat-bats it down the ground",Sangwan to Pat Cummins,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,15.1,"D Kulkarni to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, third boundary in a row. Full ball around off, Iyer waits for the ball and carves it between mid-off and extra cover",D Kulkarni to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,15.2,"D Kulkarni to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, make that four! This is excellent batting. A mini shuffle across from Iyer and is helped by a low full toss on middle and leg. Helped away through backward square leg",D Kulkarni to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,15.3,"D Kulkarni to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, and another one! Kulkarni is feeling the heat. Drifts one on the pads of Iyer. Tickled away fine into the fine leg fence",D Kulkarni to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,17.0,"Faulkner to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, with mid-off up, you don't bowl full. That's exactly what Faulkner did and got punished. Iyer drills the drive wide of a diving mid-off fielder. 21 off the over and DD need just 23 with three overs to go",Faulkner to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,18.5,"Faulkner to Shami, FOUR, oh Soni! What have you done? Slower ball, was a full toss as well. Shami backs away and throws the kitchen sink. Manages an outside edge, that goes to the left of short third man. Soni, there, initially went to his right and hence couldn't stop that as it spun away from his dive. That could well be the turning point",Faulkner to Shami,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,19.3,"Basil Thampi to Mishra, FOUR, 3 off 3 now! What a shot! Dhoni-esque. Dances down the track and elegantly flicks it through mid-wicket after converting it into a full toss. Wristily played and it raced away off the bat. Jaddu gives up in the deep",Basil Thampi to Mishra,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,19.4,"Basil Thampi to Mishra, FOUR, Mishra has done it! He was the villain against RCB early in the tournament, not giving strike to Pant. Not today. With seven needed off four balls, he comes in and hits two boundaries. Cheeky shot. Back of the hand slower ball, was a full toss as well. Mishra moved across, waited for a long time and helped it away wide of the keeper. Akshdeep Nath at fine leg, tried his best, but couldn't stop the ball from going past the rope. DD win by 2 wickets",Basil Thampi to Mishra,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,3.0,"D Kulkarni to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, beautifully done. The ball is coming on so well that you need not go hard at it. All timing. Back of a length outside off, Iyer punches it through point with a firm bottom hand",D Kulkarni to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,3.2,"Sangwan to Nair, FOUR, the bat-face opens as Nair tries to loft a drive over mid-off but he's got enough behind it to skew it over the infield. Gets it away into the extra-cover boundary",Sangwan to Nair,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,3.5,"Sangwan to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, pounces on the width and flashes it up and over backward point. Poor delivery. Iyer up and running with a nice couple of boundaries",Sangwan to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,4.2,"Basil Thampi to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, overpitches and Iyer puts him away. It's a juicy delivery on middle, with Thampi perhaps missing a yorker. Nice roll of the wrists from Iyer to flick it through mid-wicket. The man in the deep is too square",Basil Thampi to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,4.4,"Basil Thampi to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, Thampi gets too straight and too full again and he's been whipped away. Iyer not missing out on any freebies he gets. Beats short fine leg to his right",Basil Thampi to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,5.1,"Dwayne Smith to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, now here's a surprise. Dwayne Smith bowling in the powerplay. He drops it short and wide first ball and is crashed to the boundary. DD building some good momentum",Dwayne Smith to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,5.4,"Dwayne Smith to Nair, FOUR, treating Smith with utter disdain. That's dismissive. Good length ball, Nair muscles it with a lot of bottom hand over mid-on. Nearly carried all the way",Dwayne Smith to Nair,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,5.5,"Dwayne Smith to Nair, FOUR, he's decided that Smith has to go. Really good tactics from Nair. These are gentle medium pace deliveries and he's backing himself to clear the infield. Goes over mid-on again. One bounce and over",Dwayne Smith to Nair,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,6.0,"Dwayne Smith to Nair, FOUR, oh shocker. Very short and very wide. With third man up, all Nair has to do is make some connection, especially with him going so hard. Upper-cuts it over short third man",Dwayne Smith to Nair,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,7.0,"Jadeja to Nair, FOUR, goes down low, reverses his stance and scoops the reverse-sweep over short third man. Nair rattling along. 30 off 13 balls now",Jadeja to Nair,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,9.2,"Faulkner to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, this is what he was trying to do the previous ball. Gets it spot on this time. Waits on the back of length delivery, allows it to pass him and then taps it just beside the keeper to have it racing into the third man boundary",Faulkner to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,DC 1st Inns,9.4,"Faulkner to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, and again. Such a deft touch. Normal pace from Faulkner and Iyer utilizes all of it and steers it cheekily. Karthik dives, third man dives, but to no avail",Faulkner to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,0.2,"Zaheer to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, the outfield here is so quick. Cutter on the pads of Dwayne Smith and he tucks it past the square leg umpire. The man behind square on the on-side did not have much to cover, yet the ball beat him to the fence",Zaheer to Dwayne Smith,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,1.3,"Shami to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, precision at its best. A normal seam-up delivery around off and Ishan Kishan drives on the up, opens the face of the bat a bit to place it between cover and point",Shami to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,10.4,"Corey Anderson to Karthik, FOUR, top shot! Short of length, Karthik rides the bounce and punches it beautifully through extra cover, the fielder at mid-off was a touch too straight and had no chance of stopping that",Corey Anderson to Karthik,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,12.1,"Corey Anderson to Finch, FOUR, not where he intended, but that should relieve some pressure. The cross-seam back of a length delivery delivery, Finch heaves and the inside edge goes behind square on the leg-side, Shami had no chance in the deep",Corey Anderson to Finch,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,12.3,"Corey Anderson to Karthik, FOUR, poor delivery and Anderson pays for it. 9 runs off the first three balls. The off-pace delivery is on the pads, Karthik glances it fine and picks up the second boundary of the over",Corey Anderson to Karthik,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,14.1,"Brathwaite to Finch, FOUR, GL picking up the run rate. Six followed by a four. Rubbish from Brathwaite, sprays it down leg, Finch helps it along the way and beats a squarish fine leg",Brathwaite to Finch,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,15.3,"Zaheer to Finch, leg byes, FOUR, appeal for LBW and umpire Anil Chaudhary has got it spot on. Right off the back boot. Low full toss and Finch wanted to sweep it, missed and the ball runs away off the right boot. The ball had pitched outside leg and hence a good decision from the umpire",Zaheer to Finch,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,16.4,"Brathwaite to Jadeja, FOUR, some charity from Brathwaite. A nice juicy full toss outside off for the new batsman, Jadeja had ample time to pick his spot and he slices it behind point, away from the deep point fielder",Brathwaite to Jadeja,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,17.0,"Brathwaite to Finch, FOUR, now the finesse from the Australian. Had the width to play whatever shot he needed, he chooses to back cut it behind square on the off-side, splitting backward point and short third man to perfection",Brathwaite to Finch,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,17.2,"Pat Cummins to Finch, FOUR, that is straight in Finch's alley. Full and outside off, and he is too good with the inside out shots, stays leg-side of the ball and goes over the fielder, couple of bounces and into the fence",Pat Cummins to Finch,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,17.3,"Pat Cummins to Finch, FOUR, wow! What wristwork. He backed away and Cummins follows him, almost cramped for room is Finch, but still manages to whip it wide of long-on. The strong wrists come into play to execute that shot",Pat Cummins to Finch,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,18.1,"Shami to Jadeja, FOUR, Shami's turn for some charity work. Second full toss Jadeja has got this innings and he has put that away, heaved wide of mid-wicket, got it high on the bat but more importantly had found the gap",Shami to Jadeja,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,2.2,"Zaheer to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, shaping in this time. But Zaheer has gone too full, making things easier for Ishan Kishan. Whips it past mid-wicket. Timed it beautifully",Zaheer to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,20.0,"Pat Cummins to Faulkner, FOUR, streaky, but GL will take it. It was a good over from Cummins. Full, fast and slanting into the batsman, Faulkner heaves across the line and the inside edge eludes a diving Sanju Samson",Pat Cummins to Faulkner,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,3.5,"Shami to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, that's his area - behind square on the on-side and Shami is playing into his court by bowling it short. Now that Ishan Kishan has got the idea of the pace off the pitch, he is picking them well. Pulled this one over the man at fine leg, who is inside the ring",Shami to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,4.5,"Zaheer to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, so lucky Ishan Kishan is there. Tries to drive a full ball from off and almost chops it on. The ball misses the stumps and rolls to the fine leg boundary",Zaheer to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,5.4,"Pat Cummins to Raina, FOUR, Raina makes room and gets a short ball to his liking. Cuts over cover, a couple of bounces and into the fence",Pat Cummins to Raina,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,6.0,"Pat Cummins to Karthik, FOUR, races off the bat of Karthik. Did not try to hit that hard. Just timing and made sure that he placed it well. Driven on the up past cover, what a way to get off the mark",Pat Cummins to Karthik,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,6.2,"Mishra to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, bad ball. Down the leg-side, Ishan Kishan does not have to do much, sweeps it well to the fine leg fence. Was trying a googly there",Mishra to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,6.5,"Mishra to Karthik, FOUR, slides down the leg-side. Karthik helps it fine off the inside part of the willow. Races to the fence",Mishra to Karthik,FOUR
2544566,GL 1st Inns,7.4,"Brathwaite to Finch, FOUR, what timing from Finch there. Gets on his toes and accomodates the bounce and angle from Brathwaite, tucks through backward square leg",Brathwaite to Finch,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,0.1,"Hardik Pandya to Guptill, FOUR, swing for Hardik, but it's full and way outside off. Guptill leans into the drive and hits it over the man at cover-point, a few bounces and over the ropes",Hardik Pandya to Guptill,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,0.3,"Hardik Pandya to Guptill, FOUR, edged and four, Harbhajan leaped at first slip, might have got a finger-tip on that, but there was no way he was catching it. Guptill came down the track to a floaty outswinger, gets a thick edge as he slapped, the edge just about cleared the leaping first slip fielder",Hardik Pandya to Guptill,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,1.0,"Hardik Pandya to Saha, FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from Hardik, it was short as well. Saha leans into the free-flowing drive and finds the gap past cover-point, no need to run for those",Hardik Pandya to Saha,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,1.2,"McClenaghan to Saha, FOUR, nicely played by Saha, hint of width outside off. Saha waits on it, opens the face of the bat and guides it past the slip cordon, no one in the deep and the ball rolls away to the fence",McClenaghan to Saha,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,1.5,"McClenaghan to Saha, FOUR, beautifully played, length delivery on the stumps, Saha gets forward, uses his wrists to good effect and flicks it over mid-on, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes",McClenaghan to Saha,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,10.5,"Bumrah to Maxwell, FOUR, intentional! Maxwell waits for this seam-up delivery and opens the face of the bat at the last moment to get this one past the keeper to his right, races away",Bumrah to Maxwell,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,13.3,"Harbhajan to Saha, FOUR, Saha is deceived for a while, in the flight. But does well to go with the shot and hits it well enough to beat the dive from long-off to his right. Eventually timed it really well",Harbhajan to Saha,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,15.5,"McClenaghan to Saha, FOUR, slower balls lose their venom when banged in short. Like this time. Saha has all the time in the world, waits and pulls to the left of the man at deep square leg",McClenaghan to Saha,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,16.5,"Bumrah to Saha, FOUR, such awareness from Saha, sees the mid-off is inside the ring, makes room and lofts over him so nonchalantly. A couple of bounces and into the fence",Bumrah to Saha,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,2.0,"McClenaghan to Saha, no ball, FOUR, lovely shot from Saha, he's looking in good touch already. A no-ball as well as McClenaghan flicked the bails during his delivery stride. Turns out to be a low full-toss, Saha presents a straight bat and punches it back past the non-striker",McClenaghan to Saha,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,3.3,"Malinga to Saha, FOUR, expensive start from Malinga, it was the slower ball, but it gave Saha plenty of time to spot it. He makes room and carves it inside out over cover, a couple of bounces and over the ropes",Malinga to Saha,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,3.4,"Malinga to Saha, FOUR, this is turning out to be a very expensive over from Malinga, short and on the stumps, Saha swivels across and pulls it behind square on the on-side, back-to-back boundaries for Saha",Malinga to Saha,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,4.1,"Bumrah to Guptill, FOUR, drilled, Bumrah kept it full and on the stumps, Guptill backs away, makes room and drives it through the gap at extra-cover, no need to run for those",Bumrah to Guptill,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,5.1,"Karn Sharma to Guptill, FOUR, tossed up on the stumps, Guptill was setting himself up for the big slog sweep, gets a thick inside edge and beats the fielder at square leg, rolls away to the fence",Karn Sharma to Guptill,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,5.2,"Karn Sharma to Guptill, FOUR, lovely, tossed up nicely by Karn, right in the zone for Guptill, he clears his left leg and drills it back over the bowler's head, one bounce and over the ropes",Karn Sharma to Guptill,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,6.2,"McClenaghan to Saha, FOUR, cheeky and four, leg-stump half-volley from McClenaghan, Saha bends down low, uses McClenaghan's pace and laps it past the keeper, no need to run for those with fine-leg inside the ring",McClenaghan to Saha,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,6.4,"McClenaghan to Maxwell, FOUR, nicely played by Maxwell, back of a length and on the stumps, he waits on it, opens the face of the bat and runs it past the keeper. The pace of McClenaghan does the rest",McClenaghan to Maxwell,FOUR
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,7.0,"McClenaghan to Saha, FOUR, this is excellent batting from Saha, McClenaghan went short and wide of off as Saha backed away, he waits on it, uses the pace of the bowler and taps it on its head, splits the gap between backward point and short third man to perfection",McClenaghan to Saha,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,0.1,"Sandeep Sharma to Simmons, FOUR, and Mumbai take off with Punjab's momentum. Gets a delivery nipping onto the pads and tickles it away fine enough to go all the way",Sandeep Sharma to Simmons,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,1.3,"Matt Henry to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, pouncing on the pace. Pouncing on the bounce. 142kays of it and Parthiv throws everything at it as he hacks it. And even a mistime is enough on this carpet to race it away into the fence - the mid-wicket one",Matt Henry to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,1.4,"Matt Henry to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, more of the pace offered. This time Parthiv forces it through the line. 142kays again and a front footed smear through the covers. Ah, elegance all over it",Matt Henry to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,1.5,"Matt Henry to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, make that three. Parthiv on a carnage. Pitched up further, more of the width and an invite to get back to the business of dispatching these away. Done with another full flowing cover drive",Matt Henry to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,10.2,"Ishant to Nitish Rana, FOUR, time for cliches, ""Fortune favours the brave"" chirps Laxman Sivaramakrishnan on air. Also, french cricket from Rana, goes for the almighty pull, the ball shapes in a touch, takes the inside edge and beats a diving Saha, who sprawled to his right. Runs away to the fence in a jiffy",Ishant to Nitish Rana,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,16.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Pollard, FOUR, it's a summer sale. Pollard is making a joke of these boundaries. Sandeep misses his yorker, serves it up on a fuller length, Pollard brings his bottom hand into effect, dumps it straight down the ground",Sandeep Sharma to Pollard,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,17.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Karn Sharma, FOUR, another massive over for Mumbai. Again, Sandeep offers a full toss, Karn frees his shoulders and clouts it wide of long-on, Maxi runs to his left and tries to keep the ball back in play but in vain",Sandeep Sharma to Karn Sharma,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,17.3,"Mohit Sharma to Karn Sharma, FOUR, this match ain't over folks. To rub salt into the wounds and other jazz. Mohit goes wider of off, Karn protracts his hands and lifts it over cover-point",Mohit Sharma to Karn Sharma,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,17.4,"Mohit Sharma to Karn Sharma, FOUR, this is getting better and better for Mumbai. Full toss and outside off, Karn throws the kitchen sink and gets an outside edge that runs past short third man",Mohit Sharma to Karn Sharma,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,2.5,"Ishant to Simmons, FOUR, oh my. That's a punch, a ramp and an upper cut all in one. Ishant looks to climb onto his neck. A typical Caribbean back footed stride and an open batted punch to race it through the cordon",Ishant to Simmons,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,4.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Simmons, FOUR, a wasted line. Ruins what was well on the course of turning out to be a top over. Down leg and helped along getting it past the man at short fine",Sandeep Sharma to Simmons,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,4.2,"Ishant to Simmons, FOUR, all timing. And glory. Nicely pitched up, very friendly. The reply isn't am afraid. A perfect approach to the pitch of the delivery and a smear to time the pants off it. Through the covers",Ishant to Simmons,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,4.4,"Ishant to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, okay now a few runs for the luck brigade. Nicely snaking up and a desperate/compulsive pull takes the top edge and flies in no man's land. Over the keeper's head",Ishant to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,5.0,"Ishant to Simmons, FOUR, pile on the misery. Ishant slips, tumbles, falls down and then gets up to see the ball hitting the fence. A slip onto the hips and nurdled away fine enough. Mumbai well on course",Ishant to Simmons,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,8.1,"Mohit Sharma to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, oh the cheek. The deft. Attempts the scoop and nails it. Off the middle of the blade, nothing streaky about this one as he guides it past the keeper",Mohit Sharma to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,8.2,"Mohit Sharma to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, now conventional. But keeps thudding the fence. Forces it full, forces it wide and amplified further with Parthiv backing away and smacking the drice off a knee. Sliced over a leaping Ishant at short third",Mohit Sharma to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,8.3,"Mohit Sharma to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, short. Down leg. But Parthiv refuses to relent. Keeps the dancing shoes on. Gets inside the line and pulls it away past the lurking short fine. This is murder. Call 100",Mohit Sharma to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4550802,MI 1st Inns,9.0,"Mohit Sharma to Nitish Rana, FOUR, a new man, the same old line down leg and the same old response. Doesn't matter that it is only the first ball he's facing. Whips it away with enough chunk of wood on it to take it behind square",Mohit Sharma to Nitish Rana,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,13.3,"Christian to Samuels, FOUR, lovely shot, width on offer from Christian, Samuels backs away and slaps it square on the off-side. Tripathi got across to his left from deep point, puts in the slide and drags the ball back in - but the ball slowly rolls back onto the ropes",Christian to Samuels,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,17.2,"Unadkat to Nair, FOUR, lovely shot, width on offer from Unadkat, Karun arches back, waits on the ball and cuts it late - gets it into the gap behind point and beats the fielder getting across to his left from deep point",Unadkat to Nair,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,18.0,"Unadkat to Nair, FOUR, expensive over from Unadkat, topo short and at his pace it's easy pickings for the batsman. Karun waits on it and pulls it in front of square on the on-side. Long-on has no chance of cutting it off",Unadkat to Nair,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,3.1,"Washington Sundar to Nair, FOUR, this is excellent improvisation from Nair. Gets well outside the line and sweeps it over short fine leg for a boundary",Washington Sundar to Nair,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,3.3,"Washington Sundar to Nair, FOUR, good batting that from Nair. His eyes lit up for the tossed up delivery outside off and a perfect execution of the slog sweep. Finds the cow corner fence on the bounce",Washington Sundar to Nair,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,4.1,"Stokes to Nair, FOUR, Nair showing his class now. Sees the width outside off and helps it wide of short third man. With the field inside the circle on the off-side, this shot was always on the cards",Stokes to Nair,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,4.5,"Stokes to Nair, FOUR, Nair is in the zone today. He is seeing the ball well and has the awareness of the field. Makes room to this short delivery and pulls it well over the infield. The ball bounces just once before crashing into the ad boards",Stokes to Nair,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,5.0,"Stokes to Nair, FOUR, Stokes tries to attack the pads of Nair. He backs away and chips it over mid-wicket. Fielder from deep square leg tries to get across, but fails to stop the ball from rolling over",Stokes to Nair,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,5.1,"SN Thakur to Pant, FOUR, Pant gets into the act now. Full and straight, Pant goes through the line and drills it straight down the ground. Smith had no chance of stopping that at mid-on",SN Thakur to Pant,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,5.2,"SN Thakur to Pant, FOUR, nicely done. Thakur slips one down the leg. Pant goes low and helps it down to fine leg. Fine leg was inside the circle and the ball raced away to the fence in no time",SN Thakur to Pant,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,5.5,"SN Thakur to Pant, FOUR, Thakur is struggling with his line. Left-right combination is making it much difficult for him to stick to one line. Now he slips onw down the legs of Pant, who helps it down to fine leg with a flick",SN Thakur to Pant,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,6.5,"Zampa to Nair, FOUR, 50-run stand comes up for the duo with a top shot from Nair. Wasn't all that short, Nair quickly jumps on the back foot and cuts it square of the wicket. The fielder in the deep was too square and had no chance of stopping that",Zampa to Nair,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,7.5,"Christian to Nair, FOUR, exactly what he could have done with the third ball this over. Short and wide again, Nair gets his back foot across and slaps it past backward point. The ball rockets to the fence",Christian to Nair,FOUR
6270193,DC 1st Inns,8.1,"Zampa to Pant, FOUR, rank long hop from Zampa. Gets what it deserves. Pant rocks on the back foot and pulls it hard along the ground. Splits deep backward square leg and deep mid-wicket to perfection",Zampa to Pant,FOUR
6270193,RPS 1st Inns,0.3,"Zaheer to Smith, FOUR, this one does not swing. And hence there is no exaggerated shuffle from Smith. Stands his ground and flays the drive through cover. Races away",Zaheer to Smith,FOUR
6270193,RPS 1st Inns,0.5,"Zaheer to Tripathi, FOUR, Tripathi shows how to tackle the inswinger from Zaheer. Steps down and clips with the swing to bisect the field between mid-on and mid-wicket",Zaheer to Tripathi,FOUR
6270193,RPS 1st Inns,1.4,"Shami to Smith, FOUR, slower ball. Smith does not bother getting closer to the ball. All hands from him as he drives through extra cover. Zaheer has his hands on Shami's shoulder. Must be some words of wisdom",Shami to Smith,FOUR
6270193,RPS 1st Inns,10.3,"Pat Cummins to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, another iffy slog which results in a miscue, but Tiwary gets enough on it this time to drag the ball over wide mid-on and into the boundary. That's precisely why he was targeting this shot. Mid-on is inside the ring, and with a little bit of fortune, he's able to muscle it over him",Pat Cummins to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR
6270193,RPS 1st Inns,12.0,"Mishra to Stokes, FOUR, that's brilliantly bowled, and Mishra is so unlucky here. Having not given anything by way of flight all through the over, he tosses up a googly and dangles it wide of off to reap the pay-off for his pressure. Stokes bites, has an almighty swish at it but he is trying to drag the ball into the on-side against the turn, a ball which is very wide in the first place. The edge is found but it zooms over the man at slip",Mishra to Stokes,FOUR
6270193,RPS 1st Inns,12.3,"Pat Cummins to Stokes, FOUR, hoho, fierce! Absolutely fierce from Stokes. He's just showed Cummins who's the boss.

6270193,RPS 1st Inns,14.0,"Samuels to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, smart from Tiwary. Samuels generally bowls it quicker through the air, so Tiwary smartly stoops across on the back knee, uses the pace and paddles it round the corner. His placement is spot on, splitting the dives from short fine and long leg",Samuels to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR
6270193,RPS 1st Inns,19.5,"Pat Cummins to Manoj Tiwary, leg byes, FOUR, away to the boundary, but that's not enough. What irony. The one ball which Cummins has nailed into the blockhole has gone to the ropes. Tiwary is beaten by it, the ball hits his boot, misses leg-stump by a whisker and leaves the keeper wrong-footed. But it's game over with eight needed off one",Pat Cummins to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR
6270193,RPS 1st Inns,3.3,"Nadeem to Smith, FOUR, steps down and almost loses the balance but does well to slap it past point. How often does he do he something like that? Pretty often",Nadeem to Smith,FOUR
6270193,RPS 1st Inns,3.5,"Nadeem to Smith, FOUR, and now Nadeem drops it short. Smith uses the depth of the crease and cuts past point",Nadeem to Smith,FOUR

6270193,RPS 1st Inns,5.5,"Shami to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, just a little push but the sound it made was a proof of superb timing. Manoj Tiwary got on the front foot and then beat the man at cover",Shami to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR
6270193,RPS 1st Inns,6.4,"Mishra to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, too much risk involved for a single. Oh, wait. Shami at fine leg has made sure that Manoj Tiwary is rewarded well for the risk, Tiwary had taken his front foot long way across to fetch the sweep from off and middle. Was lucky to have connected",Mishra to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR
6270193,RPS 1st Inns,9.4,"Nadeem to Stokes, FOUR, fuller ball on the legs of Stokes, who gets the toe-edge while trying to flick. The ball races to the third man fence",Nadeem to Stokes,FOUR
3320338,GL 1st Inns,0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, first four of the innings. Beats the five men on the off-side with a cracking cut. The width was there and he pounced on that beating a diving cover-point",Bhuvneshwar to Dwayne Smith,FOUR
3320338,GL 1st Inns,1.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, the slip was there for Ishan Kishan's first ball. But he was taken off for this one and guess what the ball goes right through that gaping hole. Good delivery from Bhuvneshwar, hitting a length and getting bounce, the edge was found but there was no-one to catch and it runs away to the third man fence",Bhuvneshwar to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
3320338,GL 1st Inns,10.4,"Rashid Khan to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, mowed from outside off and beats long-on to his right. Knelt down and hit it, not with great timing but good enough to get it in the gap and four more",Rashid Khan to Dwayne Smith,FOUR
3320338,GL 1st Inns,11.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, very sloppy from Dhawan. Attacked the ball in trying to prevent the second and gives away two more. Thrashed to him and in running to his left from sweeper, he lets it go through his hands. A slight bobble before the ball came to him, but still should've been stopped",Bhuvneshwar to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
3320338,GL 1st Inns,15.1,"Rashid Khan to Jadeja, FOUR, smashed. Too full and Jadeja used his levers to bullet it past the umpire. Who did well to get out of the way",Rashid Khan to Jadeja,FOUR
3320338,GL 1st Inns,16.1,"Siraj to Faulkner, FOUR, low full toss and sliding down, helped past backward square leg. Easy delivery to get and Faulkner doesn't miss out",Siraj to Faulkner,FOUR
3320338,GL 1st Inns,17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Jadeja, FOUR, awkwardly for Warner and he can't stop it. A high full toss, swung away by Jadeja, bounces just in front of his body and he can't even get a hand on that. Slips away from his grasp",Bhuvneshwar to Jadeja,FOUR
3320338,GL 1st Inns,3.0,"S Kaul to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, four more. Again the pull. Can't bowl into his strengths. Into his range. This short ball sits up for him and he unleashes the Brian Lara-esque one-legged short arm-jabbed pull. Beats short fine to his right and races away",S Kaul to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
3320338,GL 1st Inns,4.1,"Siraj to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, short and wide outside off, Ishan Kishan rolled his wrists on the cut and got it down, beats extra cover and gets another boundary",Siraj to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
3320338,GL 1st Inns,4.2,"Siraj to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, too full this time from Siraj and Ishan Kishan lofts over mid-off. Siraj is bleeding here and Ishan has raced to 31 off 13",Siraj to Ishan Kishan,FOUR

3320338,GL 1st Inns,5.5,"Nabi to Dwayne Smith, FOUR, and now four more. Nabi fired that fuller and faster on the stumps, a powerful drive and Warner at mid-off is slightly wide, so can't get there and once he did, didn't dive. Smith is hurting SRH",Nabi to Dwayne Smith,FOUR

3320338,SRH 1st Inns,1.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, the slip was there for Ishan Kishan's first ball.

2553863,KKR 1st Inns,11.0,"Vinay Kumar to de Grandhomme, FOUR, now Rohit is angry. Must be at Vinay Kumar. He brought the third man up and Vinay Kumar hasn't bowled to his field.

2553863,KKR 1st Inns,2.0,"Johnson to Gambhir, FOUR, Johnson flashes a wry smile. After conceding a boundary. Short into the body, but not that high to cause any trouble, Gambhir swivels and pulls, beats deep backward square running to his left.

2553863,KKR 1st Inns,3.0,"Southee to Chris Lynn, FOUR, and he shows us here that it is not all brawn about him. There is a smart brain to go with it as well.

2553863,MI 1st Inns,1.4,"de Grandhomme to Saurabh Tiwary, FOUR, easy pickings for Tiwary, can't bowl short and wide - when you have third man inside the ring.

2553863,MI 1st Inns,14.2,"Narine to Rayudu, FOUR, gets another drag down. And the off-cutter. Opens up his front leg, lines up and has all the time to unleash a power through mid-wicket. A much needed fence hit for Mumbai - and Rayudu. Only his second",Narine to Rayudu,FOUR
2553863,MI 1st Inns,14.5,"Narine to Saurabh Tiwary, FOUR, too short. And pays the price. Some pressure off his shoulders with a rock back deep inside the crease and a pull into the cow corner fence. Piercing the gap to perfection",Narine to Saurabh Tiwary,FOUR

4211071,KXIP 1st Inns,13.1,"Mujeeb to Pant, FOUR, such strong bottom hand! Wow! This kid certainly packs a punch, doesn't he? Fired fuller by Mujeeb and Pant was on the charge, adjusts to drill it powerfully past the bowler. Long-on had no chance",Mujeeb to Pant,FOUR
4211071,KXIP 1st Inns,13.5,"Mujeeb to Rahul Tewatia, FOUR, what a shot to start! Gee, Tewatia has come out with a mission. Doesn't bother to have a look at Mujeeb's variation and opts for the reverse sweep straight away. It was the same shot that got Munro but Tewatia connects well to send it soaring over backward point",Mujeeb to Rahul Tewatia,FOUR
4211071,KXIP 1st Inns,19.4,"Mohit Sharma to Chris Morris, FOUR, just wide of Tye's outstretched hands running to his left from deep mid-wicket. Had a lot of work to do but was never really going to get to it. Slower ball on a shortish length and Morris went for the forehand smash. Mistimed it but luckily, got it in the gap. Or nearly in the gap. Doesn't matter how they come as long as they do",Mohit Sharma to Chris Morris,FOUR
4211071,KXIP 1st Inns,3.2,"Axar to Gambhir, FOUR, quintessentially Gambhir. Axar was from round the wicket to the left-hander, Gambhir charges down whilst making some room and lofts it through extra cover. Superb hit",Axar to Gambhir,FOUR

4211071,KXIP 1st Inns,5.4,"Andrew Tye to Gambhir, FOUR, cracks away a pull shot. Who said he's not good with the short balls. Rises in sync with the height on this short delivery and pumps it through square leg. Another great shot today from the master",Andrew Tye to Gambhir,FOUR
4211071,KXIP 1st Inns,8.5,"Axar to Gambhir, FOUR, top-edge through fine leg. A delivery going down leg from over the wicket, the left-hander is in no shape to sweep that. Goes for it and gets lucky",Axar to Gambhir,FOUR
1206999,KKR 1st Inns,0.1,"Chahal to Narine, FOUR, here he is! Not wasting any time. He's at it. It's a tossed up delivery around off, Narine grounds his knee and pummels it dead straight over the bowler's head. Four runs!",Chahal to Narine,FOUR
1206999,KKR 1st Inns,1.4,"Woakes to Chris Lynn, FOUR, first boundary for Lynn. Lucky to be still out there though. This was a full length delivery around off, Lynn swings hard at it and gets an inside edge, past the stumps and beats the fielder at short fine leg",Woakes to Chris Lynn,FOUR
1206999,KKR 1st Inns,10.5,"Washington Sundar to Karthik, FOUR, you don't bowl full tosses to DK. Not when he's in such form. DK leans forward a touch and belts the leather through covers, blazed away...",Washington Sundar to Karthik,FOUR

1206999,KKR 1st Inns,15.1,"Woakes to Rinku Singh, FOUR, pressure? What's the spelling of that word? This guy seems to have exactly that sort of attitude.

1206999,KKR 1st Inns,18.5,"Kulwant Khejroliya to Vinay Kumar, FOUR, clears his front leg and lays the finishing marker on the game. AB at mid-on slides to his left, but realizes that's too far to fetch. So, Dinesh Karthik and KKR start off their campaign in style, a morale-boosting 4-wicket win over RCB. A typical slog from Vinay Kumar, all he needed to do was clear mid-off and boy did he hit that hard! Comfortably past mid-on",Kulwant Khejroliya to Vinay Kumar,FOUR
1206999,KKR 1st Inns,3.3,"Woakes to Narine, FOUR, no stopping him, it seems. Short of a length and outside off, Narine slaps hard and evades the fielder at cover-point. He's in the zone folks!",Woakes to Narine,FOUR
1206999,KKR 1st Inns,3.4,"Woakes to Narine, FOUR, beats the chasing RCB skipper this time around. It's a lightning quick outfield, just look at it. Even the fast moving feet of Kohli can't stop this.

1206999,KKR 1st Inns,4.3,"Washington Sundar to Narine, FOUR, he's taking down RCB single handedly, is he?

1206999,KKR 1st Inns,9.1,"U Yadav to Nitish Rana, FOUR, that was timed to perfection. Short of a length around off, Rana stands tall and chips this over mid-on. High elbows and poses for the camera.

1206999,RCB 1st Inns,0.1,"Vinay Kumar to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, that's not the start Karthik would have wanted from a senior pro.

1206999,RCB 1st Inns,1.0,"Vinay Kumar to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, turns out to be a really poor over from Vinay Kumar, didn't bowl to the field.

Great start for RCB, 14 off the over",Vinay Kumar to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
1206999,RCB 1st Inns,1.1,"Chawla to de Kock, FOUR, that's a friendly flighted delivery full and outside off stump, de Kock leans forward and doesn't over-hit the ball, drives nicely along the ground and hits the gap at cover. The ball escapes past the diving fielder",Chawla to de Kock,FOUR

1206999,RCB 1st Inns,3.5,"Chawla to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, this time he cuts well and gets it in the gap between cover-point and backward point. The length was just short enough for McCullum to rock back and execute the shot",Chawla to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
1206999,RCB 1st Inns,4.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, that's completely mistimed, yet McCullum will get a boundary, this game is so cruel for the bowlers.

9944694,RR 1st Inns,11.3,"Rahul Tewatia to Buttler, FOUR, master of manipulating the field. There's a leg slip now instead of silly point, and the tossed up one on off is reverse-lapped to third man for four",Rahul Tewatia to Buttler,FOUR
9944694,RR 1st Inns,12.1,"Shami to Rahane, FOUR, that flat-batted swipe coming down the track to a length ball. Made room, slapped it inside out to deep extra cover for four past a diving cover. He's absolutely leathered that",Shami to Rahane,FOUR
9944694,RR 1st Inns,12.2,"Shami to Rahane, FOUR, short outside off, Rahane drags it towards the on-side with a clouted pull to deep mid-wicket for four. Boult made a lot of room, running across a few yards and diving in front, and nearly pulled off a screamer but the ball flicks his thumb and ricochets away into the fence",Shami to Rahane,FOUR
9944694,RR 1st Inns,16.5,"Chris Morris to Buttler, FOUR, short-ish and wide, Buttler slashes and slashes hard, as that blazes away in front of third man for four. The spin on that shows you how hard he sliced that...",Chris Morris to Buttler,FOUR
9944694,RR 1st Inns,2.3,"Boult to Stokes, FOUR, whackkkkkkkkkk! Stokes has had enough of proding around. Charges down the track and makes room before blasting this wide of the man at mid-off. Races away to the fence in no time",Boult to Stokes,FOUR
9944694,RR 1st Inns,4.3,"Boult to Samson, FOUR, sheer class! Samson had some runs in the last game and hence, is in a good space mentally. Gets a full ball that's not all that wide but Samson got a nice stride forward and eased the square drive through point. The timing was fab",Boult to Samson,FOUR
9944694,RR 1st Inns,5.0,"Boult to Rahane, FOUR, just short of backward square leg! For a moment, the fielder in the ring thought he had a chance but it bounced in front of him and sneaked through. Once it got past him, the outfield did the rest. Short of a length ball that Rahane pulled without bothering to keep it down. Fortunate that it didn't go to hand",Boult to Rahane,FOUR
9944694,RR 1st Inns,6.1,"Shami to Rahane, FOUR, freebie to start from Shami and Rahane puts it away in style. Half-tracker and it's asking for trouble on this easy-paced surface. Rahane swivels on the back foot and controls the pull with elan through backward square leg",Shami to Rahane,FOUR
9944694,RR 1st Inns,8.2,"Nadeem to Samson, FOUR, deft touch! If the previous shot showcased his power, this is all about finesse. Slower and around off, not all that short but Samson waits for it on the back foot before essaying the late cut. Gets it very fine and just past the keeper as it races to the fence. He is in the zone, is Samson",Nadeem to Samson,FOUR
9944694,RR 1st Inns,9.3,"Rahul Tewatia to Rahane, FOUR, rubbish ball and Rahane will feast on these all day. Gets a drag on around middle and leg, sits on the back foot and nails the pull through square leg. Found the gap",Rahul Tewatia to Rahane,FOUR

5989339,MI 1st Inns,10.5,"Rashid Khan to Pollard, FOUR, that is Pollard's riposte. The wrong 'un on a fullish and Pollard used his reach to good effect, pressed forward and struck it straight back over the bowler, couple of bounces and into the fence",Rashid Khan to Pollard,FOUR
5989339,MI 1st Inns,12.0,"S Kaul to Pollard, FOUR, needless. Kaul brought third man up and Pollard sends the ball there. Should have followed the mantra off the first five deliveries. On a length outside off, Pollard dabbed it late and beat short third man with ease",S Kaul to Pollard,FOUR
5989339,MI 1st Inns,14.3,"Stanlake to Pollard, FOUR, for the second time Pollard uses the pace of Stanlake to pocket a boundary. Fraction short and outside off, Pollard waits in the crease and steers it behind point, Kaul at third man should have done a better job of stopping that.

5989339,MI 1st Inns,20.0,"S Kaul to Markande, FOUR, cheeky! Markande decides to do something about the length Kaul was bowling, moving across the stumps and laps the length delivery over short fine leg, enough legs on that to reach the fence",S Kaul to Markande,FOUR
5989339,MI 1st Inns,3.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, edged and four, more runs for Kishan, more frustration for Sandeep.

5989339,SRH 1st Inns,2.3,"Sangwan to Saha, FOUR, dropped! Cutting is the culprit. An ugly hoick attempted from Saha and he mistimed it horribly.

It was a good length ball and Saha was slightly late into his shot",Sangwan to Saha,FOUR
5989339,SRH 1st Inns,2.5,"Sangwan to Saha, FOUR, the top-edge goes over the keeper's head and runs away for another boundary.

1505006,MI 1st Inns,14.1,"Shami to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, 124kph, short of length delivery just outside off, Kishan cheekily dabs it fine of short third man",Shami to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
1505006,MI 1st Inns,14.4,"Shami to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, these are weird tactics. Both fine leg and third man are up, so you'd expect the length to be full. But Shami's gone short more often than not. Now agreed, this one rushes Kishan on the pull as he's taken by surprise. But he swings into it and the top-edge balloons past the keeper. Always a risk with this field",Shami to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
1505006,MI 1st Inns,15.2,"Christian to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, just over extra-cover! 117kph, length ball wide of off, Kishan had to reach out for it but he throws everything and is able to smear it over the fielder",Christian to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
1505006,MI 1st Inns,16.2,"Shami to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, off-cutter from Shami, but it's right in the slot for Krunal to hammer it over mid-off",Shami to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
1505006,MI 1st Inns,2.1,"Boult to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, nicely done. He's not giving up. Pitched it right up there again, desperately hoping for some swing, but is driven handsomely down the ground",Boult to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
1505006,MI 1st Inns,2.3,"Boult to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, that's box-office chic and very good thinking. Short ball angled across, Suryakumar Yadav's ducking initially, then sees that the height isn't much and ramps that over to the third man fence with utter style",Boult to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
1505006,MI 1st Inns,3.2,"Nadeem to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, that's dropped a touch short, so even though it's turning the ball's hittable. Suryakumar Yadav rocks back and slaps that disparagingly wide of mid-off",Nadeem to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
1505006,MI 1st Inns,4.2,"Shami to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, now this is a fine, fine yorker.. and look what happens. Suryakumar Yadav squeezes it out with an open bat face and has that scooting to the third man fence. Who says cricket's for egalitarians?!",Shami to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
1505006,MI 1st Inns,5.0,"Shami to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, let's say Shami's gotten obsessed with bowling yorkers. More yorkers. Better yorkers. He wants redemption for that boundary that Suryakumar Yadav hit earlier in the over. Goes for one again, bowls a low full toss on leg-stump instead -- how? why? what? -- and is flicked round the corner",Shami to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
1505006,MI 1st Inns,5.1,"Christian to Lewis, FOUR, from over the wicket and that's been pitched full. Right there to be hit. Lewis doesn't even bother about the footwork. Stays put and slamns that through wide mid-off",Christian to Lewis,FOUR
1505006,MI 1st Inns,5.2,"Christian to Lewis, FOUR, about time we saw a half-volley. All he had to do was stay leg-side of the ball and deflect it with an open bat face. Does so, and it's a boundary through cover-point",Christian to Lewis,FOUR
1505006,MI 1st Inns,5.4,"Christian to Lewis, FOUR, another. Keep 'em counting. Another half-volley, and this one's been scorched through covers with an elegant bat flow. The deliveries remain the same, only Lewis's shots are evolving into something more telegenic",Christian to Lewis,FOUR
6298097,KKR 1st Inns,1.3,"Stanlake to Chris Lynn, FOUR, that's a cracking shot. Width on offer and Lynn makes the most of it. Short and wide outside off, throws his bat at it and crunches it past the fielder at point, races away to the fence in no time",Stanlake to Chris Lynn,FOUR
6298097,KKR 1st Inns,1.4,"Stanlake to Chris Lynn, FOUR, Williamson pulls off a blinder, almost. Good length delivery around off, Lynn goes ahead with his lofted shot and miscues it over mid-off, Williamson goes back running, extends his right arm but can't take the catch, the ball crawls away to the long-off boundary",Stanlake to Chris Lynn,FOUR
6298097,KKR 1st Inns,10.3,"Shakib to Narine, FOUR, throws his hands at another ball drifting away and shoots an outside edge over the two fielders behind square on the off-side",Shakib to Narine,FOUR

6298097,KKR 1st Inns,17.4,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, FOUR, another leg break, Karthik waits and waits before dabbing that just wide of the keeper. Boundary through third man",Rashid Khan to Karthik,FOUR
6298097,KKR 1st Inns,2.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Chris Lynn, FOUR, the power of Lynn on that shot will take that away to the fence. Slower delivery, the knuckle ball by Bhuvi, Lynn backs away and goes through with his horizontal slap, beats the man at mid-on and finds the fence. Wasn't middled properly but those muscles help him",Bhuvneshwar to Chris Lynn,FOUR
6298097,KKR 1st Inns,2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Nitish Rana, FOUR, crunched away! Good length delivery angled away from the batsman, Rana rocks back and slams that through the gap at point, lightning speed on that as the batsman gets his first boundary, on the first ball. Positive start for the southpaw",Bhuvneshwar to Nitish Rana,FOUR
6298097,KKR 1st Inns,4.2,"S Kaul to Chris Lynn, FOUR, slapped away! Knuckle delivery, fraction short and outside off, Lynn frees his arms and goes aerial, evades cover-point with a cut and manages to get four runs",S Kaul to Chris Lynn,FOUR
6298097,KKR 1st Inns,4.3,"S Kaul to Chris Lynn, FOUR, lucky favoring Lynn tonight. This is a slower delivery again, full in length around off, the big man swings hard at it and manages to get an inside edge, past the stumps, past the man at short fine leg and into the fence",S Kaul to Chris Lynn,FOUR
6298097,KKR 1st Inns,5.0,"S Kaul to Chris Lynn, FOUR, glorious! He's off to a flier, like always. This is a full length ball and well outside off, Lynn doesn't miss out and drills it through covers, right into the gap, Kaul greeted with 14 runs, quite expensive.",S Kaul to Chris Lynn,FOUR
6298097,KKR 1st Inns,6.0,"Rashid Khan to Nitish Rana, FOUR, ends the over with a cracking boundary. This was short and width was there, enough for the batsman to go ahead with his square cut and find the fence",Rashid Khan to Nitish Rana,FOUR
6298097,KKR 1st Inns,9.5,"S Kaul to Chris Lynn, FOUR, another inside edge and Lynn survives. Fullish around off, Lynn swings hard at it and gets an inside edge past the leg-stump, moves on to 46* with that boundary",S Kaul to Chris Lynn,FOUR
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,0.5,"Johnson to Saha, FOUR, first runs off the bat from Saha and SRH. It was on the stumps, Saha gets in the position quickly and whips it wide of the fine leg fielder for a four",Johnson to Saha,FOUR
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,1.2,"A Russell to Saha, FOUR, just over of the square leg fielder. It was on a good length and outside off, Saha pulls it off the front root, manages to clear the fielder and ball races for a four",A Russell to Saha,FOUR
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,1.5,"A Russell to Dhawan, FOUR, another short of length delivery, Dhawan gets into position quickly and pulls it in front of square for a four. He doesn't time it as well as he would have liked but the placement is good enough",A Russell to Dhawan,FOUR
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,10.2,"Kuldeep Yadav to Williamson, FOUR, Williamson puts this away. Much needed release of pressure. Short googly from Yadav, the SRH captain sits back and pumps it through mid-wicket",Kuldeep Yadav to Williamson,FOUR
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,10.3,"Kuldeep Yadav to Williamson, FOUR, four more. Two short balls in a row from Yadav. He'll be disappointed by this. Googly on leg-stump, Williamson picks length early, gets down low and swats it through backward square",Kuldeep Yadav to Williamson,FOUR
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,11.4,"A Russell to Shakib, FOUR, Shakib swivels into the pull but is clearly hurried by this short of length delivery. He's lucky that the top-edge has flown over the keeper's head",A Russell to Shakib,FOUR
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,11.5,"A Russell to Shakib, FOUR, now goes over mid-off! He was actually done in by the slower ball, as evidenced by his bottom hand coming off, but more importantly, he went through with it",A Russell to Shakib,FOUR
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,17.5,"Johnson to Y Pathan, FOUR, Pathan kills the crowd's enthusiasm, crashes this full ball through extra cover. What a hit. He nailed this drive to the fence",Johnson to Y Pathan,FOUR
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,18.3,"A Russell to Y Pathan, FOUR, hoists this over extra-cover. Pathan's stepping up to the occasion against his former franchise. Back of length delivery outside off, he gets it close to the bottom of the bat but there's enough on the drive to clear cover",A Russell to Y Pathan,FOUR
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,2.3,"Johnson to Saha, FOUR, Johnson is becoming predictable here with his length. It was on a short of length again, Saha holds his shape and pulls it over square leg for another four.",Johnson to Saha,FOUR
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,2.4,"Johnson to Saha, FOUR, another slower ball outside off from Johnson. Saha reads the change in pace and drives it through the off-side for a four",Johnson to Saha,FOUR
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,2.5,"Johnson to Saha, FOUR, cracking shot! It was touch fuller of good length, Saha lofts it wide of the mid-on fielder for a four. he played that shot with a straight bat and that made it even better. Minimum risk and effective result!",Johnson to Saha,FOUR

6298097,SRH 1st Inns,4.4,"Chawla to Williamson, FOUR, goes on the back foot in a flash and drives it through cover for another four. Stellar timing from the skipper",Chawla to Williamson,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,0.1,"Gowtham to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, McCullum is off the mark and so is RCB, that too in style. Short and wide outside off, Brendon punches it hard towards cover and a misfield by Samson results in a boundary. He has scored 91* but can't take fielding lightly",Gowtham to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,1.1,"D Kulkarni to Kohli, FOUR, elegance personified there. Full length delivery outside off, Kohli walks down the track and creams his drive, through the gap at cover and there's no stopping that, such was the precision in the placement",D Kulkarni to Kohli,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,1.3,"D Kulkarni to Kohli, FOUR, Chinnaswamy erupts as Kohli smokes one. Backs away, reaches for it and slams the length delivery over covers, one bounce and into the fence. Was middled to perfection, sweet sound of the willow too",D Kulkarni to Kohli,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,1.4,"D Kulkarni to Kohli, FOUR, another impressive shot. After two shots on the off-side, Kohli gets one through the on side. Moves towards the pitch of the delivery, keeps his eyes on the ball and flicks it over mid-wicket. Three boundaries already in the over. This is going to be an exciting run chase if Kohli keeps playing like this",D Kulkarni to Kohli,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,11.5,"Unadkat to de Villiers, FOUR, slower back of length ball again, this time there's a little bit of width which allows AB to carve it away between backward point and short third man. It was uppish, but the placement was spot on",Unadkat to de Villiers,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,14.3,"Laughlin to Mandeep, FOUR, normal pace from Laughlin this time, Mandeep uses those extra 10kph and slices it away through backward point. Nicely done",Laughlin to Mandeep,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,16.3,"Unadkat to Mandeep, FOUR, short of length delivery outside off, Mandeep slices the cut away through backward point. The ball spun away from sweeper cover who dived too early and fell at least 3 feet short of getting to it",Unadkat to Mandeep,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,16.4,"Unadkat to Mandeep, FOUR, Unadkat not having a great time here. Bowls this full and wide outside off, Mandeep stretches across and slices it for another boundary, this time wide of third man",Unadkat to Mandeep,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,18.1,"Stokes to Washington Sundar, FOUR, these are all useful runs to reduce the margin of defeat. Surely they can't win this can they? Stokes misses his yorker by a couple of inches and is sliced away over backward point",Stokes to Washington Sundar,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,19.2,"Laughlin to Mandeep, FOUR, gets inside this short of length delivery and helps the pull over short fine leg. It was really well done because this was a slower ball and there really wasn't a lot of pace to work with",Laughlin to Mandeep,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,19.3,"Laughlin to Mandeep, FOUR, slower ball which swings away from Mandeep. He gets down low, uses the swing and slices it past short third man. Wonderful batting",Laughlin to Mandeep,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,19.4,"Laughlin to Mandeep, FOUR, just short of the yorker mark, and Mandeep takes toll by hammering it down the ground for four. Really good showing from him, even though in a losing cause",Laughlin to Mandeep,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,2.2,"Gowtham to Kohli, FOUR, Kohli continues to deal in boundaries. Rocks back, picks the length early and punches it through the gap at covers again, away she goes, into the fence",Gowtham to Kohli,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,3.0,"Gowtham to de Kock, FOUR, first one of the innings for de Kock. He has joined the skipper now. Flatter in trajectory and outside off, de Kock doesn't miss out on it and slaps it through the gap at covers, he needs to play along with Kohli if RCB want to make a match out of it. Can't be chased alone this target",Gowtham to de Kock,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,3.3,"Unadkat to de Kock, FOUR, beautiful! Pitches it on middle and leg, de Kock makes sure to send it to the long-on fence with a fine on-drive, RCB... RCB... are the chants all across the stadium",Unadkat to de Kock,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,4.4,"Gowtham to de Kock, FOUR, there's no stopping these two. Tossed up delivery around off, de Kock reaches for it with a shimmy and times his chip over long-off, quality shot",Gowtham to de Kock,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,4.5,"Gowtham to de Kock, FOUR, another one! The bowlers have no answers to this brilliance by the RCB pair. The left hand - right hand combination is make it difficult for the bowlers. This was floated on middle and de Kock went down on his knee to sweep it through square leg",Gowtham to de Kock,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,5.1,"Stokes to Kohli, FOUR, ""welcome into the attack Mr Stokes,"" says Kohli. Picks the length on that short one early and makes sure to pummel it over mid-wicket, he's in the zone guys.",Stokes to Kohli,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,5.5,"Stokes to Kohli, FOUR, can't bowl such freebies to a batsman of this class. It's a juicy full toss outside off, Kohli brings his bat down in time and angles it past the fielder at point, he's toying with the field here, finding those gaps with ease",Stokes to Kohli,FOUR
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,6.3,"Shreyas Gopal to Kohli, FOUR, right into the gap there! Shortish delivery on middle and leg, Kohli goes back and pulls it with authority beating the man at deep mid-wicket",Shreyas Gopal to Kohli,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,1.2,"Woakes to Rahane, FOUR, juicy. He's in some weird mood, happy to go horizontally right away, gets that length that sits up, hoping to be smacked. Obliged. Airy over mid-wicket",Woakes to Rahane,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,10.0,"U Yadav to Stokes, FOUR, that sitting up length. On the tummy, quite Stokes' staple. He stays up, lets it get in his arc and heaves. Those muscles .. through mid-wicket",U Yadav to Stokes,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,11.2,"Khejroliya to Stokes, FOUR, high quality shot! Why move around the in the crease and swipe when you can play shots like this. This was full and quite wide as well, Stokes played the square drive late to bisect short third man and backward point with precision. Top stuff!!",Khejroliya to Stokes,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,12.3,"Chahal to Buttler, FOUR, signature Buttler start! Wastes no time to get going. Brings out the reverse sweep and takes this on the full, makes enough connection to beat a diving backward point. Finds the fence",Chahal to Buttler,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,13.0,"Chahal to Buttler, byes, FOUR, geee, that's beaten everyone! Comedy of errors really. Buttler went for premeditated paddle, de Kock anticipated and was en route to his left already but guess what, the stroke didn't connect and the ball went through the yawning gap between first slip and the keeper",Chahal to Buttler,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,14.0,"Negi to Buttler, FOUR, edged but no slip! You don't expect one at this stage of a T20 inning either for most bowlers. Lovely piece of bowling from Negi, floated up nicely to invite the drive from Buttler and forced the edge as well. Too hard for de Kock and it raced past him to the fence",Negi to Buttler,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,18.5,"Woakes to Samson, FOUR, gets it away very, very fine! Didn't intend to get it that fine perhaps but he won't mind, will he? The perfect yorker from Woakes but Samson digs it out with an open bat face. Manages to slice itwell past a diving de Kock to the fence. When it's your day, it's just your day!",Woakes to Samson,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,19.0,"Woakes to Samson, FOUR, didn't I tell you that this is his day? Samson survives once more. Fuller ball and he goes for the lofted stroke over cover. For a moment, the man at sweeper cover thought he had a chance but was late I guess. Put in a late dive and it bounced before him, then sped through to the fence",Woakes to Samson,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,19.3,"U Yadav to Tripathi, FOUR, bleeding runs! Slower and short, the leg stump line doesn't help and Tripathi swivels to pull it easily over square leg. Another boundary",U Yadav to Tripathi,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,2.4,"Washington Sundar to Rahane, FOUR, thank the injury. When you can't run, you slog. Rahane sits, uses the line already down leg to sweep. Hard. Behind square. One-bounced",Washington Sundar to Rahane,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,3.4,"U Yadav to Rahane, FOUR, backs away in the crease, converts it into one in his slot and goes all bottom-handed in lofting into cow corner. One way of avoiding run-outs",U Yadav to Rahane,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,4.0,"U Yadav to Rahane, FOUR, hoick. Mid-wicket. Again. It's getting familiar. Another friendly length for Rahane to get under and smoke it down",U Yadav to Rahane,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,4.3,"Chahal to Rahane, FOUR, on the sweep. Never mind the top-edge, the powerplay is his ally. His stride doesn't quite get him to the pitch of it, the spin's big too. But these big bats allow him to clear square leg, and that's enough",Chahal to Rahane,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,5.0,"Chahal to D Arcy Short, FOUR, oh these nice float-ups. Short ain't getting foxed, lets it dip. Loads up. Might swing. And flat down the ground",Chahal to D Arcy Short,FOUR
3552968,RR 1st Inns,5.3,"Woakes to Rahane, FOUR, he's toying around. May his leg never recover. Makes Woakes bowl straight, threatening a move around. But sways inside the line, flat-batted and hammers it round the corner. Pile on the powerplay",Woakes to Rahane,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,1.2,"Mohit Sharma to Watson, FOUR, throws his hands out. He's already given himself width with his exposed stance. Swings, uppish and slices it with ease over point. Never mind the mistime",Mohit Sharma to Watson,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,1.3,"Mohit Sharma to Watson, FOUR, 137.7kph. Turns cheeky. Mohit tries to correct, getting the channel close to off, but Watson's not getting foxed. He stays back, arches and ramps it ever so late, teasing the man at short third",Mohit Sharma to Watson,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,10.4,"Andrew Tye to Rayudu, FOUR, short ball, this time Yuvraj does not have time to react. The ball races away towards his right and into the fence",Andrew Tye to Rayudu,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,16.4,"Andrew Tye to Dhoni, FOUR, he's muscled that! Look at that ball go so flat and one bounce into the wide long-off fence. Slower delivery outside off stump, Dhoni steps out and the ball sat up nicely for Dhoni to free his arms and smash",Andrew Tye to Dhoni,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,17.0,"Andrew Tye to Jadeja, FOUR, oh that's a timely hit! Slower ball on the shorter side, Jadeja made room, lost balance but managed to cut that nicely over cover-point and there's no protection in the deep. 12 off the over, 55 more needed",Andrew Tye to Jadeja,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,17.1,"Mohit Sharma to Dhoni, FOUR, in the airrr, could be out, oh the fielder makes a mess of it. Low full toss, Dhoni slogs, should have been held at deep mid-wicket, Dagar the sub wasn't quick enough to move forward, he dived but let it pass. He's immediately moved out of that position",Mohit Sharma to Dhoni,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,18.4,"Andrew Tye to Dhoni, FOUR, talk about presence of mind and there's Dhoni with a bit of deftness. Short ball with third man inside the ring, unbelievable from the bowler. Dhoni spots the field, just guides the ball over the infield to the third man fence. Sehwag smiles from the dug out",Andrew Tye to Dhoni,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,19.3,"Mohit Sharma to Dhoni, FOUR, he's squeezed this in the gap. There were three fielders behind square on the off-side - point, backward point and short third man, yet Dhoni finds the gap. Can't blame the bowler for bowling a wide yorker, he bowled to the field",Mohit Sharma to Dhoni,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,2.3,"Barinder to Rayudu, FOUR, all timing. Back, lining himself behind and drills it to mid-off's right. Ashwin isn't the quickest, manages a palm. The outfield isn't Punjab's ally either",Barinder to Rayudu,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,3.4,"Mohit Sharma to Rayudu, FOUR, on the charge, converts the length into his arc and on-tonks. Not the legs, but nobody's cutting this off with nobody in the vicinity of long-on",Mohit Sharma to Rayudu,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,4.2,"Andrew Tye to Rayudu, FOUR, too straight. Never an ideal follow up delivery, never an ideal any delivery. Rayudu's quick to pounce, shuffles inwards and tucks, splitting the gap between the keeper and short fine",Andrew Tye to Rayudu,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,5.2,"Mujeeb to Billings, FOUR, a heap of runs. A half-tracker, then the googly starting from middle and spinning well down leg. Billings isn't happy pocketing a wide, he reaches leg-sided, connects and heaves it into fine leg",Mujeeb to Billings,FOUR
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,7.4,"Yuvraj to Dhoni, FOUR, drags the length down. Very defensively. Dhoni doesn't have time to pat things back tonight. He chases, hard, and powers it behind point",Yuvraj to Dhoni,FOUR

2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,0.2,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR, breaks the barrier of respect and drives it on the up, uppishly. Over cover and into the fence. The ball was in the zone and the batsman did not hold back to smack it away",Chahar to Rahul,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,1.0,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR, ho ho ho!! That was creamed away. Length ball, dangling away and the batsman eases the cover drive away into the gap. The ball speeds away into the fence. Again the ball curved away but the neat footwork towards the line of the ball ensured the batsman had it covered. Action-packed start",Chahar to Rahul,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,1.1,"Harbhajan to Gayle, FOUR, leaning drive! Classical touch play with a big stride forward and the ball screams past cover for a four. Slightly flatter it might have been and the batsman got it away. That would help",Harbhajan to Gayle,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,13.5,"Dwayne Bravo to Yuvraj, FOUR, picked the gap beautifully did Yuvraj. Short ball at 123.6kph, Yuvraj picked the length early. Stood tall and pummeled the pull between long-on and deep mid-wicket",Dwayne Bravo to Yuvraj,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,14.0,"Dwayne Bravo to Yuvraj, FOUR, follows the bumper with a yorker and Yuvraj brings his bat down at the right time.

Was clearly off the bat",Dwayne Bravo to Yuvraj,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,14.5,"Tahir to Nair, FOUR, good shot to get off the mark. In-drifter, slightly errs in line. Too straight and Nair's wrists does the rest. Flicks it through mid-wicket",Tahir to Nair,FOUR

2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,2.5,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR, short ball, bad ball and put away. The batsman was waiting for it and swats the pull away fine on the on-side for a four. Crisply timed and it ran away. Rahul has run into a massive purple patch",Chahar to Rahul,FOUR

2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,3.4,"Harbhajan to Rahul, FOUR, did I sanity? Pardon me. Gayle's partner-in-crime joins the act and creams the full toss outside off away into the covers. The ball raced away into the fence",Harbhajan to Rahul,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,4.0,"Harbhajan to Rahul, FOUR, if it is power from one end, it is all grace from the other. The batsman leans into the drive and threads the ball away like a seasoned tailor. The man at mid-off had no chance even with the dive to his left. Superb bit of batting",Harbhajan to Rahul,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,4.1,"SN Thakur to Gayle, FOUR, edged and gone! Gone for a four. Dhoni does not go for it to his left. Should be classified as a chance even if it might have been touch and go. The slip was wide and the ball goes between the keeper and the slip for a four. That is a huge reprieve for Gayle",SN Thakur to Gayle,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,4.4,"SN Thakur to Rahul, FOUR, CSK have not done their homework. That was short again and the batsman stays back to pull the ball away with a lot of control. The man at deep fine had no chance",SN Thakur to Rahul,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,5.0,"SN Thakur to Gayle, FOUR, short ball again, the batsman does not time the pull away. But he gets enough meat on it and sends it past mid-on for a four. Fifty up for KXIP. All carnage at Mohali",SN Thakur to Gayle,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,5.3,"Chahar to Gayle, FOUR, crafty and controlled. The short ball, the batsman gets on top of it and guides it past short fine leg for a four. The man at short fine leg and deep square leg tried to cut it off but in vain",Chahar to Gayle,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,5.4,"Chahar to Gayle, FOUR, punched and K.O! That was actually a pile driver down the ground. Picks the short of length delivery and punishes it down the ground, uppishly, for a four past mid-off",Chahar to Gayle,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,6.1,"Tahir to Rahul, FOUR, full toss on the pads and Rahul adds four to his tally. That was clipped away and the slide from the man at deep mid is not good enough",Tahir to Rahul,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,6.4,"Tahir to Gayle, FOUR, fifty on KXIP debut! The big boss is owning the evening. That was in the zone, too full and the batsman thumped it down the ground for a four. One bounce and it escapes into the fence. And look at the big man, he does the cradle act with both his arms. He is thrilled to bits",Tahir to Gayle,FOUR
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,9.4,"Harbhajan to Mayank Agarwal, FOUR, sliced away! No respect for the veteran spinner and the ball races away into the fence. Man at sweeper cover had no chance",Harbhajan to Mayank Agarwal,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,1.2,"A Russell to Gambhir, FOUR, cracking shot, overpitched and well outside off, Gambhir leans forward and places it into the gap past cover-point, beat the man in the ring and rolled away to the fence",A Russell to Gambhir,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,1.4,"A Russell to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, short, wide and four, Shreyas Iyer's eyes lit up as he saw the width, got on top of the bounce and cracked it square past point, no need to run for those",A Russell to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,13.0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Shami, FOUR, more flight on this ball and Shami eyes the mid-wicket region. Swings hard and gets a fat outside edge that goes over the slip fielder. Runs away to the third man fence",Kuldeep Yadav to Shami,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,2.4,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, FOUR, change of pace from Mavi, but Pant spotted it well, waited on the short ball, rolled his wrists and helped it behind square on the on-side, beat short fine and raced away to the fence",Shivam Mavi to Pant,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,3.2,"A Russell to Pant, FOUR, much better from Pant, full and just outside off, Pant brings his bat down and drills it back past the non-striker. Mid-off is very wide and has no chance",A Russell to Pant,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,3.3,"A Russell to Pant, FOUR, Pant has been lucky in this innings so far, pitched up and well wide of off, he saw the width and threw his hands at that, slices it high and over cover, couple of bounces and over the ropes",A Russell to Pant,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,4.0,"A Russell to Maxwell, FOUR, just over cover and the small Eden Gardens outfield means it's a boundary for Maxwell. He backed away to a short and wide ball, had to reach out for the slap, didn't get it off the middle, but has enough to clear the infield",A Russell to Maxwell,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,4.5,"Shivam Mavi to Maxwell, FOUR, short, wide and four, no one moved after Maxwell flashed it behind square on the off-side, a poor ball and Maxwell took full toll of it",Shivam Mavi to Maxwell,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,5.3,"Narine to Pant, FOUR, much needed for DD, very full and around off, Pant gets his left leg out of the way, brings his bottom-hand into play and drills it wide of mid-on, beats the fielder in the ring and rolls away to the fence",Narine to Pant,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,5.4,"Narine to Pant, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Pant, gets down low to a well flighted delivery outside leg, rolls his wrists and sweeps it behind square on the on-side for a boundary",Narine to Pant,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,6.2,"Chawla to Pant, FOUR, this is excellent batting from Pant, Chawla dropped this one short and just outside off, Pant makes room, lets the ball go past him and then cuts it square behind point for a boundary",Chawla to Pant,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,7.1,"Tom Curran to Pant, FOUR, cracking shot, full and well outside off, right in the slot for Pant as he drives it past cover, the fielder in the deep has no chance",Tom Curran to Pant,FOUR
2619288,DC 1st Inns,8.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Maxwell, FOUR, reverse sweep and four, flighted delivery outside off, Maxwell bends down half-way and then gets it past the keeper, no chance for short third man and the ball rolls away to the fence",Kuldeep Yadav to Maxwell,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,11.2,"Vijay Shankar to Nitish Rana, FOUR, right in between deep mid-wicket and deep backward square. The short ball sits up for Nitish Rana, who swivels on the back foot and though he pulls in the air, he hits the gap",Vijay Shankar to Nitish Rana,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,13.2,"Chris Morris to Karthik, FOUR, this is classy. Effortless batting by DK. Length delivery angling in to middle and leg, Karthik flicks over mid-wicket and leaves deep mid a spectator",Chris Morris to Karthik,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,13.3,"Chris Morris to Karthik, FOUR, an action replay of the previous delivery. Chris Morris just stares in despair. At DK who has flicked him again over mid-wicket. Sheer timing and nearly went all the way, one bounce over the ropes. What form he is in at the moment",Chris Morris to Karthik,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,15.3,"Chris Morris to Nitish Rana, FOUR, went for the short delivery again, but took the pace off it, sits up for Nitish Rana who slashes over point and beats sweeper cover running across",Chris Morris to Nitish Rana,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,17.3,"Boult to Shubman Gill, FOUR, goes short and Shubman Gill gets off the mark with four. On the body, pulled hard through mid-wicket and Gill finds the gap",Boult to Shubman Gill,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,17.5,"Boult to Nitish Rana, FOUR, this guy has talent. Make no mistake about it. Turns a near yorker into a boundary. Special skill when you can do that. Backed away a tad and directed it with an open face, just wide of short third, who didn't get across. Should've done better",Boult to Nitish Rana,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,18.1,"Chris Morris to Nitish Rana, FOUR, how good is he with those cuts and carves on the off-side. Sits deep in his crease, waits for the full delivery and then at the last moment opens the face of the bat to drive in the air, there's a fielder placed exactly for that shot, but the ball bounces wide of him and speeds to the fence",Chris Morris to Nitish Rana,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,19.0,"Chris Morris to Shubman Gill, leg byes, FOUR, poor delivery and deserved four. High full-toss sliding down leg, brushes the thigh pad of Shubman Gill and beats Pant's dive to his left. Runs away fast to the fine leg fence. Chris Morris has been disappointing with the ball tonight",Chris Morris to Shubman Gill,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,3.0,"Boult to Chris Lynn, FOUR, that is smashed. Belted by Chris Lynn as he saw the short of length delivery outside off and didn't hold back. Went aerial over cover-point and gets four",Boult to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,3.3,"Nadeem to Chris Lynn, FOUR, he wants to go only one way - through the off-side. This is a good shot, hammers it hard and wide of extra-cover, who didn't dive. It was a quicker one and on the stumps, but Chris Lynn found the gap",Nadeem to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,4.3,"Boult to Uthappa, FOUR, shot. Slightly fuller than a good length on the stumps, Uthappa just biffed it over the bowler's head. Not a very good connection, but good enough to clear everyone. Breaks the shackles a bit",Boult to Uthappa,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,4.5,"Boult to Chris Lynn, FOUR, clobbered by Chris Lynn. Boult went round the wicket to cramp up the batsman, but provided the ideal length for the Aussie to hit, brutalised past the stumps at the other end. The ball was gone before Boult could stick his boot in",Boult to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,5.0,"Boult to Chris Lynn, FOUR, nearly holed out. But gets four thanks to Morris' fumble. At long-on. He went for the catch, but the ball bounced in front of him and since he didn't get his body behind the line of the ball, it runs away. Was a full-toss and Chris Lynn biffed that in the air",Boult to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,5.5,"Nadeem to Uthappa, FOUR, drags it short, the arm-ball went wrong. Fired it outside off, Uthappa cuts that hard and eludes a diving cover-point to his left. As soon as he got it past the fielder, it was four",Nadeem to Uthappa,FOUR
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,9.3,"Nadeem to Nitish Rana, FOUR, now shows his intelligence by sweeping wide of short fine leg. Knows deep square is too square and won't get there, got outside the line and knelt down to play the sweep well",Nadeem to Nitish Rana,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,1.2,"Woakes to Rohit, FOUR, classy shot! He has been out of form but strokes like these should set Rohit up nicely. Half-volley and not all that wide, but he leans nicely to caress the drive through the covers. Raced away to the fence in no time",Woakes to Rohit,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,11.5,"Corey Anderson to Rohit, FOUR, rubbing insult. A nothing half tracker, drifting down leg and Rohit loads up on the back foot, swivelling as he swats it powerfully behind square. One-bounced",Corey Anderson to Rohit,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,14.2,"U Yadav to Rohit, FOUR, now compensated with width too. The length stays short and friendly. Rohit carves, doesn't even bother keeping it down, given how fine third man is. And yes, it's a fifty .. his first of this season",U Yadav to Rohit,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,15.0,"U Yadav to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, and now feeds the pads for some reason. Umesh's dealing in binaries here. Whipped away, typically bottom-handed, teasing fine leg",U Yadav to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,15.1,"Corey Anderson to Rohit, FOUR, angling wide across. Rohit in some form, he leans, frees up his hands, taking it head-on in hammering it square. Oh the way he opens up the face in slicing,check the leather!",Corey Anderson to Rohit,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,15.4,"Corey Anderson to Rohit, FOUR, that short-wide combo. And Rohit has no shortage of time on anything. Gets in line, angry bat, angry hands on the revenge from the run-out he's caused. And into deep point",Corey Anderson to Rohit,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,19.2,"Corey Anderson to Rohit, FOUR, clears his front leg. Goes conventional. Full meat, over the bolwer, and trickling further in. Deadly death batting this",Corey Anderson to Rohit,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,19.4,"Corey Anderson to Rohit, FOUR, another juicy full toss. Oh dear. Oh dear. Flat-batted, heaving it downtown. Oh the bleeding, it's getting painful to watch",Corey Anderson to Rohit,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,2.2,"U Yadav to Lewis, FOUR, wrong line and is duly punished. Short of a length and is down leg as well, cannot do that with fine leg in the ring. Lewis swivels across for the pull and although it came off the inner half, was always a percentage shot. Beats the fielder in the ring comfortably and races away",U Yadav to Lewis,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,20.0,"Corey Anderson to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, finishing touches. Make it 21 off the over -- and Pandya's done it with a flash straight down. 213 it will be ..",Corey Anderson to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,3.1,"Washington Sundar to Rohit, FOUR, doesn't start well and on this pitch, there is little margin for error. Slightly short and a bit of width as well, Rohit sits back and crunches it through the covers. Found the gap and the outfield did the rest",Washington Sundar to Rohit,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,3.4,"Washington Sundar to Lewis, FOUR, super shot! Sundar is being put under pressure here. Flatter and a touch short outside off, Lewis waits on the back foot and punches this through the gap at backward point. Lovely stuff! Even Kohli cannot help but applaud the stroke",Washington Sundar to Lewis,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,3.5,"Washington Sundar to Lewis, FOUR, this is getting disastrous for the young off spinner but he has only himself to blame. Another fuller ball down leg, this time Lewis doesn't fail to connect. Sweeps it very fine down the leg-side and past the fielder who was in the ring",Washington Sundar to Lewis,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,4.5,"Siraj to Lewis, FOUR, bleeding runs here! This is a fab counterattack from these two and the RCB bowlers are wilting under the onslaught. Slower but short with a lot of width, allows Lewis to chance his arms with a slap cut through backward point",Siraj to Lewis,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,5.1,"Woakes to Lewis, FOUR, raining boundaries! Cannot understand this ploy though, back of a length outside off with third man in the ring. Lewis stays back and glides it, just had to beat that man in the 30-yard circle and he does it with ease",Woakes to Lewis,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,8.0,"Washington Sundar to Lewis, FOUR, not Sundar's night at all. Another drag-on, leg-stumpish and these are easy pickings for Lewis. Sits back and swivels across to clatter the pull to the deep mid-wicket fence. The offie has been unusually erratic so far",Washington Sundar to Lewis,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,9.2,"Corey Anderson to Rohit, FOUR, how hard has he hit this one! Boy, that's some power from Rohit. Charges down the track and makes room to create width. The length wasn't all that short but he clobbered it over cover. Rocketed away",Corey Anderson to Rohit,FOUR
9886489,MI 1st Inns,9.3,"Corey Anderson to Rohit, FOUR, does it again! Rohit is determined not to let his former MI teammate settle. Stays in the crease this time and just gets leg-side of the ball a touch before launching it inside out over extra cover. Delicious strokeplay!",Corey Anderson to Rohit,FOUR
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,1.0,"Bumrah to Kohli, FOUR, what a shot. Bumrah overdoes, overpitches and that's too easy for Kohli. Gets forward, with a full face of the bat and creams it past mid-on. That boundary will ruin a decent over by Bumrah",Bumrah to Kohli,FOUR
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,1.1,"Krunal Pandya to de Kock, FOUR, is greeted to the crease with a boundary. Flighted on the stumps, de Kock gets and sweeps. Gets it more off the top-edge but it sails over behind square. No-one there and they'll collect a boundary",Krunal Pandya to de Kock,FOUR
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,1.3,"Krunal Pandya to Kohli, FOUR, uppish and through Pollard's hands at short mid-wicket. Trademark Kohli whip. Clears his front leg and swats it off his pads. Pollard leaps but in vain. Races away to the boundary at deep mid-wicket",Krunal Pandya to Kohli,FOUR
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,1.5,"Krunal Pandya to Kohli, FOUR, this is tripe. Gift packed and delivered to Kohli. Flat and short outside off, Kohli goes back and thrashes it through cover",Krunal Pandya to Kohli,FOUR
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,10.3,"Markande to Washington Sundar, FOUR, lovely hit inside-out by Washi! The googly from Markande, seemed to have picked that from the hand, got a stride forward and lofted that beautifully over cover",Markande to Washington Sundar,FOUR
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,13.0,"Bumrah to Sarfaraz Khan, FOUR, he's guided this in the gap past backward point and it's running away for four. It was the slower delivery outside off stump, Sarfaraz gets the placement right by opening the bat face at the last moment",Bumrah to Sarfaraz Khan,FOUR
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,15.3,"Mustafizur to Kohli, FOUR, he's middled this alright, doesn't bother running! The off-cutter, Kohli launches it over the bowler's head and beats long-on",Mustafizur to Kohli,FOUR
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,19.2,"Bumrah to Kohli, FOUR, outside edge and third man is inside the ring, the ball flies over him as Kohli goes hard on the attempted lofted drive. Can he get a hundred? 14 to get, 4 more deliveries to go",Bumrah to Kohli,FOUR
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,3.0,"McClenaghan to Kohli, FOUR, su-sweet. Ends the over with a boundary. Juicy half-volley from McClenaghan, well outside off. Kohli isn't sparing those. Leans across, plants his front foot towards the ball and slashes it through extra cover. Beats a crowed off-side field",McClenaghan to Kohli,FOUR
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,3.1,"Mustafizur to de Kock, FOUR, this wasn't timed as he would've liked, but de Kock will still earn a boundary. The slower delivery from Fizz, de Kock didn't pick it as he was through the shot early. Still managed to get enough wood to place it over mid-on. There's no stopping that",Mustafizur to de Kock,FOUR
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,5.1,"Mustafizur to Kohli, FOUR, edgy but looked like it was intentional from Kohli. The slower ball from Rahman, ends up as a wide yorker. Kohli digs with an open bat face, runs it more off the outer half and it beats short third man",Mustafizur to Kohli,FOUR
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,5.3,"Mustafizur to Mandeep, FOUR, cracked. Rohit isn't happy, asks Rahman to bowl towards the stumps. Fizz overpitches and offers it outside off, minimal effort from Mandeep. Shifts his weight forward and caresses the drive that beats extra cover",Mustafizur to Mandeep,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,1.4,"D Kulkarni to Narine, FOUR, edged but safe! A short delivery around off, too close to cut and Narine goes ahead with the shot. Gets a top edge that eludes the leaping keeper and finds the fence. Lucky to be still out there, but this is how he plays",D Kulkarni to Narine,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,11.1,"Laughlin to Nitish Rana, FOUR, low full toss outside off, Rana puts bat to ball and it skims away through the covers. Didn't go too hard on the drive, just focused on timing which was spot on",Laughlin to Nitish Rana,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,12.1,"Gowtham to Nitish Rana, FOUR, Gowtham darting them in real quick - 95kph this one. Rana goes back, uses the pace of it and tickles it nice and fine. Bit too straight this one from round the wicket",Gowtham to Nitish Rana,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,13.0,"Gowtham to Karthik, FOUR, oh lovely. He's already showing some excellent touch out there. 102kph delivery from Gowtham, Karthik stays back to it and then dabs it out of the keeper's gloves. So so late and really really fine",Gowtham to Karthik,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,17.3,"Stokes to Karthik, FOUR, full toss outside off, 144kph, Karthik carves it away through backward point. Rocketed off his bat",Stokes to Karthik,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,2.1,"Gowtham to Uthappa, FOUR, showed glimpses of form in the previous game too. This is short around off, Uthappa camps back and punches it well past the fielder at mid-off, placement was bang on there",Gowtham to Uthappa,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,3.3,"D Kulkarni to Narine, FOUR, finally manages to get a boundary. Was trying it since a while. This was a tad on the slower side but short enough for Narine to thrash it, goes aerial over covers and finds the boundary, his first convincing shot of the day",D Kulkarni to Narine,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,3.4,"D Kulkarni to Narine, FOUR, this was even better than the previous one. No fielders moved, just mere spectators. Short of a length outside off, Narine throws his hands at it and times his drive through the gap there, that came right from the meat",D Kulkarni to Narine,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,3.5,"D Kulkarni to Narine, FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries. Kulkarni put under pressure by Narine. Picks the length early on that short one, transfers his weight on to the back foot and pummels it through mid-wicket, the fielder there was too square to cut this off",D Kulkarni to Narine,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,4.2,"Unadkat to Uthappa, FOUR, pulled away! Short of a length on middle and leg, Uthappa picks the length on it and pulls it neatly over mid-wicket, on a bounce and over the fence there",Unadkat to Uthappa,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,4.4,"Unadkat to Uthappa, FOUR, slower delivery and that's been put away to the fence again. Just outside off and on a length, Uthappa stands tall and pumps it right over the bowler's head",Unadkat to Uthappa,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,4.5,"Unadkat to Uthappa, FOUR, cheeky. That's Uthappa's experience for you. Shortish in length around off, Uthappa simply guides it down to third man and finds the fence again, can't keep a fielder so fine",Unadkat to Uthappa,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,5.1,"Laughlin to Uthappa, FOUR, poor line! Can't bowl such freebies when a batsman is in good touch. This was a shortish delivery on the thigh and all Uthappa wanted to do is get it past the fielder at short fine leg, manages to do so. Drags it past the fielder and gets another boundary",Laughlin to Uthappa,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,7.3,"Stokes to Narine, FOUR, another edge, another boundary. On a length around off, Narine goes hard at it and gets an outside edge that makes it fly past the keeper. Even a dive by Buttler wouldn't have helped his cause",Stokes to Narine,FOUR
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,9.2,"Stokes to Uthappa, FOUR, misfield by Unadkat and Stokes isn't pleased by that. Was a back of a length delivery outside off, Uthappa went for it with hard hands, threw his bat at it and got an outside edge. Unadkat slips at square third man and misfields as the ball goes through him",Stokes to Uthappa,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,10.0,"Tom Curran to D Arcy Short, FOUR, well-timed and four. Sliding down and D Arcy Short didn't miss out. Short fine was inside the ring and deep square back, he beat the latter with a beautiful flick off the hips. That should hopefully get him going",Tom Curran to D Arcy Short,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,10.2,"Narine to D Arcy Short, FOUR, this is another short-arm jab, one bounce over the ropes at deep square. Way too short by Narine, on middle and leg, D Arcy Short picked him off easily, bisected the two men either side on the leg-side",Narine to D Arcy Short,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,11.0,"Narine to Tripathi, FOUR, this is so unlike Narine. He hasn't looked himself tonight. Another drag-down, Tripathi controls the pull and beats Mavi to his left at deep mid. 10 off that over",Narine to Tripathi,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,11.5,"Shivam Mavi to D Arcy Short, FOUR, he can do finesse too. Not only raw power. Used the pace of Shivam Mavi to full effect. Watched the back of a length delivery onto his bat and steered it to the right of the diving backward point, beats him and gives third man no chance",Shivam Mavi to D Arcy Short,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,13.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Tripathi, FOUR, this is a proper pull. Dragged down by Kuldeep Yadav and Tripathi was onto the back foot in a flash, pulled it between wide long-on and deep mid. Found the gap to perfection. Hit hard as well",Kuldeep Yadav to Tripathi,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,18.0,"Narine to Buttler, FOUR, brutal. Fraction short and that's enough for Buttler, who marmalises the back foot forcing shot. Long-off wasn't even in the picture. A rare off night for Narine",Narine to Buttler,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,19.0,"Tom Curran to Buttler, FOUR, slightly off-line and four. Can't err in any way to Buttler. Low full-toss and swung to the left of long-on, one bounce over the ropes",Tom Curran to Buttler,FOUR

6071727,RR 1st Inns,3.2,"Narine to Rahane, FOUR, lovely batting. Down the track and to the pitch before slamming it in the air, but wide of the diving Russell at mid-off. Consecutive boundaries",Narine to Rahane,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,3.3,"Narine to Rahane, FOUR, three in a row. Too short outside off, Rahane has played around with Narine's mind. Takes full toll of this, by cutting this wide of point and cover-point",Narine to Rahane,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,3.4,"Narine to Rahane, FOUR, four more. This is brilliant batting. Without any risk too. That's 16 runs off the over. The last two balls have been short, even though this bounced from a back of a length, Rahane was back and across, cuts again and does so well, to find the gap between point and cover-point. An injection of momentum, so badly needed by RR",Narine to Rahane,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,4.5,"Shivam Mavi to D Arcy Short, FOUR, first one he has timed tonight. Picks the slower delivery from a length and swings cleanly over mid-off's head",Shivam Mavi to D Arcy Short,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,5.2,"Chawla to Rahane, FOUR, magnificent cover drive. When Rahane is on song, there are few better timers of the ball in India. This is overpitched and he leans forward to caress the drive wide of cover and extra cover. Threaded the needle there",Chawla to Rahane,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,6.2,"Nitish Rana to D Arcy Short, FOUR, sliding down, just needed bat on that and D Arcy Short gets the glance going. Fine leg is too square and he had no chance",Nitish Rana to D Arcy Short,FOUR
6071727,RR 1st Inns,8.3,"Shivam Mavi to Samson, FOUR, he attempted that off the first ball and missed. Not now. Uses the pace of Shivam Mavi to great effect. Steers late and with an open face, right off the middle of the bat and Uthappa running around from third man can only watch it run away",Shivam Mavi to Samson,FOUR
2583918,KXIP 1st Inns,1.2,"Jordan to Gayle, leg byes, FOUR, bonus runs! Gayle checks his back a bit as that had struck him above the thigh pad. Back of a length around leg, he missed the flick off the back foot and it sped past a diving Saha to the fence",Jordan to Gayle,FOUR
2583918,KXIP 1st Inns,14.2,"S Kaul to Nair, FOUR, up and over! Good batting from Karun, saw mid-off up in the ring and decided to go over the man. Succeeded easily. Fuller ball outside off,",S Kaul to Nair,FOUR
2583918,KXIP 1st Inns,14.3,"S Kaul to Nair, FOUR, does it again! This time, Jordan at mid-off thought he had a chance and leapt full length but the ball sailed over him. Short of a length outside off, Karun flat-batted it with all the power and although he didn't keep it down, didn't matter at all. Runs bleeding at the moment",S Kaul to Nair,FOUR
2583918,KXIP 1st Inns,16.4,"Jordan to Nair, FOUR, mid-off inside the ring and Jordan bowls it right in the arc for Nair. He just gets under it and tonks it with a straight bat and clean swing over mid-off. Beautiful hands from Nair. Ah, poses for the paparazzis as well",Jordan to Nair,FOUR
2583918,KXIP 1st Inns,19.3,"Rashid Khan to Finch, FOUR, Finch gets into the act. Backs away, makes room and Rashid helped him by slanting it on the stumps. Golf-swung over cow corner",Rashid Khan to Finch,FOUR
2583918,KXIP 1st Inns,2.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, FOUR, elegant shot! The flourish of the bat was a sight to behold. Knuckle ball from Bhuvneshwar but too full and also too straight as well, Rahul shuffles a touch to flick it away sweetly. Bisected mid-on and mid-wicket with ease. Yusuf gave a chase but was never going to stop it even with the slide",Bhuvneshwar to Rahul,FOUR
2583918,KXIP 1st Inns,3.4,"Jordan to Gayle, FOUR, on the off-side now! Fuller ball on middle and off, Gayle is sensing the lengths early and backs away for the loft over cover. Carved it away over the infield with ease. He is getting into the groove",Jordan to Gayle,FOUR
2583918,KXIP 1st Inns,5.5,"S Kaul to Rahul, FOUR, shot of the night so far! This guy makes batting look really simple, doesn't he? Fuller ball and Rahul got the stride forward nicely before absolutely creaming the drive. On the up and what stood out was the precision in placement, bisected extra cover and mid-off with such ease",S Kaul to Rahul,FOUR
2583918,KXIP 1st Inns,6.0,"S Kaul to Rahul, FOUR, over the infield this time! Rahul also joins in the fun. Another half volley from Kaul and this is lofted straight over mid-off. Comfortably over the fielder and away she goes to the fence",S Kaul to Rahul,FOUR
2583918,KXIP 1st Inns,8.3,"Deepak Hooda to Mayank Agarwal, FOUR, almost carried to backward point! Reprieve for Agarwal, he went after this flighted delivery on seeing the width but couldn't connect the drive well. Sliced it in the air and it just fell short of the diving fielder. Sneaked past him eventually and sped to the fence",Deepak Hooda to Mayank Agarwal,FOUR
2583918,KXIP 1st Inns,9.1,"Shakib to Mayank Agarwal, FOUR, beautiful placement! Tossed up generously from Shakib but it's too wide and Agarwal executes the inside out lofted stroke with finesse. There was a man at long-off but he's got this well wide of that man",Shakib to Mayank Agarwal,FOUR
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,1.2,"Mohit Sharma to Williamson, FOUR, we have seen brute power from gayle earlier but this is total touch play from Williamson. It was a good length delivery outside off, Williamson gets in a good position and drives it on the up, ball beats the mid-off fielder for a four",Mohit Sharma to Williamson,FOUR
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,1.4,"Mohit Sharma to Saha, FOUR, picks up the slower ball early but doesn't time it as well as he would have liked, but he gets enough bat onto it to get a four to fine leg",Mohit Sharma to Saha,FOUR
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,12.2,"Mohit Sharma to Manish Pandey, FOUR, 50-run stand up. Goes for the yorker but he's bowled a nice little full toss here -- something that Manish Pandey uses to hit his first boundary. Scythed round the corner, that full toss",Mohit Sharma to Manish Pandey,FOUR
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,13.0,"Mohit Sharma to Manish Pandey, FOUR, room offered outside off and Manish Pandey's sliced it without fuss to the third man boundary. That will do",Mohit Sharma to Manish Pandey,FOUR
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,14.1,"Andrew Tye to Williamson, FOUR, 129ks on a back of a length, and veering down, there's only one way the ball's going. To the boundary. Pulled behind square",Andrew Tye to Williamson,FOUR
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,15.4,"Mujeeb to Manish Pandey, FOUR, deftly played. Googly but it's wide, and Manish Pandey waits and glides it just wide of the keeper",Mujeeb to Manish Pandey,FOUR
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,17.2,"Barinder to Shakib, no ball, FOUR, that's above the waist, and hence a no-ball. Shakib nicely arches away before realizing that he can get some bat on this. Glides it uppishly through third man",Barinder to Shakib,FOUR
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,2.0,"Mohit Sharma to Y Pathan, FOUR, Ashwin mistimes the jump and ball goes over him at mid-off for a four. It was fuller length ball at the stumps, Pathan lofts it over mid-off, just gets enough blade on the ball to clear mid-off",Mohit Sharma to Y Pathan,FOUR
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,3.4,"Andrew Tye to Y Pathan, FOUR, slower delivery at the stumps, it was fuller in length and Pathan picks up the slower ball early. He gets in a good position and hits it over mid-wicket for a four",Andrew Tye to Y Pathan,FOUR
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,4.1,"Mohit Sharma to Y Pathan, FOUR, no one moved on that ball. It was a good length delivery outside off, Pathan swats it wide of the mid-off fielder for a four. Power and placement from Pathan",Mohit Sharma to Y Pathan,FOUR
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,6.5,"Ashwin to Williamson, FOUR, gorgeous shot! Pure class from Williamson. It was a leg-spinner from Ashwin, Williamson comes down the track and lofts it with the turn over cover for a four. One of the toughest shots to play but he reached the pitch of the ball and made it easier for himself",Ashwin to Williamson,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,0.1,"Binny to Watson, FOUR, he won't miss out on that, will Watson! Waits for the slower delivery, rocks back and pumps it right over the bowler's head to get off the mark in style",Binny to Watson,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,0.2,"Binny to Watson, FOUR, that's bread and butter for Watto. Back of a length delivery outside off, Watson camps back, transfers his weight on the back foot and crunches this through the gap at covers, no fielder moved there",Binny to Watson,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,1.0,"Binny to Rayudu, FOUR, who would want to be a bowler in this format? Dropped catch just on the previous ball and this one has been belted away. Full in length outside off, Rayudu advances down the wicket and smokes it over cover for a boundary",Binny to Rayudu,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,10.0,"Unadkat to Raina, FOUR, these runs are hurting Royals, really bad. Both batsmen are looking unstoppable. Shortish delivery on leg, Raina swivels his pull past the fielder at short fine and ends the over with a boundary again. How often has that happened tonight!",Unadkat to Raina,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,10.2,"Laughlin to Raina, FOUR, the boundaries continue to flow.. Room to leg and that opens up the off-side field nicely for him, even though it is back of a length, Raina thumps it on the up over extra cover. No chance for the sweeper",Laughlin to Raina,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,11.1,"Shreyas Gopal to Raina, FOUR, streaky! But that's how Raina plays. No half measures. Darted in outside off and Raina threw his bat at that, sliced the drive over backward point and started another over with a boundary",Shreyas Gopal to Raina,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,11.3,"Shreyas Gopal to Raina, FOUR, fabulous shot! It was the wrong 'un and Raina picked it right out of the hand. Got into position to play the inside out shot and struck it handsomely over extra cover. The timing was exquisite",Shreyas Gopal to Raina,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,12.2,"Binny to Watson, FOUR, easy pickings! Back of a length on middle and leg, Watson waits and gently tickles it fine, the man is inside the ring at 45 and it was well wide of him, raced across the lightning outfield",Binny to Watson,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,12.3,"Binny to Watson, FOUR, consecutive boundaries and this was not a poor delivery. Fab shot from Watto. Spotted third man inside the ring, waited for the back of a length delivery on off and dabbed it past a diving backward point, the quick outfield takes care of the rest",Binny to Watson,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,12.4,"Binny to Watson, FOUR, third boundary of the over. Binny is going for plenty. Short delivery and at 132 clicks it is not going to trouble Watson, who pulls it along the ground in front of square, the placement was perfect",Binny to Watson,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,13.0,"Binny to Dhoni, FOUR, 19 runs off the over. Raina's wicket has done nothing to slow down the scoring rate. Off-cutter on a length, Dhoni just guides it past backward point and short third man",Binny to Dhoni,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,14.1,"Unadkat to Watson, FOUR, edged and four! Not where he intended, but when luck is on your side, everything goes your way. Unadkat comes round the wicket and cramps Watson for room, he attempts a cut shot and the outside edge runs away to the right of Buttler",Unadkat to Watson,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,16.1,"Laughlin to Watson, FOUR, Watson needs to keep going for CSK. The runs have dried up a bit in the last few overs. Trifle short and outside off and Watson waits before playing the cut shot past the diving backward point fielder",Laughlin to Watson,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,16.3,"Laughlin to Dwayne Bravo, FOUR, delicate! Slower back of a length delivery, Bravo walked across his stumps to get inside the line and then glances it off the hips past the short fine fielder, just a roll of the wrists to pocket a boundary",Laughlin to Dwayne Bravo,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,17.4,"Unadkat to Dwayne Bravo, FOUR, offers room on this slower delivery and Bravo is quick to capitalize, he waits before unleashing the cut shot over backward point, no one in the deep to stop that. Much needed boundary for Bravo",Unadkat to Dwayne Bravo,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,18.1,"Stokes to Dwayne Bravo, FOUR, one-handed pull from Bravo. He was deceived by the slower delivery and the bottom hand comes off the bat handle, but the placement is behind square and a desperate dive from Klaasen is not enough to stop the boundary",Stokes to Dwayne Bravo,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,19.0,"Stokes to Dwayne Bravo, FOUR, ends the over well. Made room while dancing down, the width on offer made him free his arms and send the ball sailing over the extra cover fielder. Rocketed away to the fence",Stokes to Dwayne Bravo,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,3.1,"Stokes to Rayudu, FOUR, boundaries continue to flow. Short and slow on middle and leg, Rayudu swivels and pulls it past the fielder at short fine leg, does well to get it past him",Stokes to Rayudu,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,4.0,"Stokes to Watson, FOUR, all bowlers are proving to be expensive. CSK openers are making the most of the powerplay. Again this was a gift of a delivery. Fullish and on the pads as Watson flicks it nonchalantly away to the fine leg region",Stokes to Watson,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,5.3,"Stokes to Raina, FOUR, typical Raina there. Full length delivery around off, gets down on his knee and sweetly times his inside out shot over covers, looked pleasing to the eye that shot",Stokes to Raina,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,5.4,"Stokes to Raina, FOUR, short one on the thigh and Raina drags it down to the fine leg fence. Stokes has struggled with his lines so far. Bowled a few looseners in his first over too",Stokes to Raina,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,5.5,"Stokes to Raina, FOUR, commits the same mistake again. Fires in a low full toss on the pads and Raina makes sure to get some bat on that. Tickles it away to the fine leg fence and gets four more, that's the third boundary of the over",Stokes to Raina,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,6.0,"Stokes to Raina, FOUR, brilliant! That's Raina's experience for you. This was a length delivery angled away from him and Raina played it late in order to guide it down to third man, the fielder was too square to cut it off. 16 runs of the over, all in boundaries!",Stokes to Raina,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,8.3,"Gowtham to Watson, FOUR, there's no stopping him tonight. This is short again outside off, Watson goes back in his crease and slams it through the gap at covers",Gowtham to Watson,FOUR
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,9.5,"Unadkat to Raina, FOUR, that's the second 50-run partnership of the match. Short and wide outside off, Raina beautifully cuts it over point and adds four to his tally",Unadkat to Raina,FOUR
8353877,RR 1st Inns,1.0,"Chahar to Rahane, FOUR, edged and four. 14 off the opening over. Streaky, but Rahane wouldn't mind much. The ball came in with the angle and Rahane got an inside edge on his push, runs away to the fine leg fence",Chahar to Rahane,FOUR
8353877,RR 1st Inns,1.1,"SN Thakur to Klaasen, FOUR, through the gates! That won't please the bowler, nor the captain. A fullish ball on middle and leg, Klaasen flicks it superbly, but was straight to the man at mid-wicket. Karn Sharma there allows it to go through his legs. First boundary in IPL for Klaasen",SN Thakur to Klaasen,FOUR
8353877,RR 1st Inns,11.2,"Tahir to Stokes, FOUR, drilled straight back, goes right through Tahir and then sneaks through Rayudu as well. Clumsy sliding effort at long-on there, but considering his bruised knee, we'll cut him some slack",Tahir to Stokes,FOUR
8353877,RR 1st Inns,13.0,"Dwayne Bravo to Binny, FOUR, he's somehow glanced this yorker into the fine leg boundary. Really well done from Binny. The line - which was on leg-stump - helped his cause",Dwayne Bravo to Binny,FOUR
8353877,RR 1st Inns,16.0,"SN Thakur to Unadkat, FOUR, oh shot. Nailed this pull shot through mid-wicket. Solid response after the previous ball",SN Thakur to Unadkat,FOUR
8353877,RR 1st Inns,17.0,"Karn Sharma to Unadkat, FOUR, the width on this delivery spelled it out for Unadkat's inside-out loft. He frees his arms to cream it wide of long-off",Karn Sharma to Unadkat,FOUR
8353877,RR 1st Inns,18.1,"Karn Sharma to Unadkat, FOUR, quickly onto the back knee to swat this leg-break through mid-wicket. Plenty of muscle from Unadkat as he swishes it to the boundary",Karn Sharma to Unadkat,FOUR
8353877,RR 1st Inns,7.4,"Tahir to Buttler, FOUR, hit hard! Buttler uses his feet to good effect. Dances down the ground to convert it into a half-volley and drills it down the ground. Long-on had no chance to mop that up",Tahir to Buttler,FOUR
8353877,RR 1st Inns,8.3,"Watson to Stokes, FOUR, poor delivery and that's been put away. First boundary for Stokes! With fine leg inside the circle, he bowls a short ball down the leg-side. Stokes gets a glove on the pull and the ball goes fine of the fielder at 45",Watson to Stokes,FOUR
8353877,RR 1st Inns,9.2,"Tahir to Stokes, FOUR, cracking shot! Stokes backed away even before the ball was delivered and that allowed him to free his arms. It was darted outside off and Stokes crashed it through extra cover",Tahir to Stokes,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,1.5,"Mujeeb to Chris Lynn, FOUR, loosener from Rahman and Lynn puts it away with ease. Stand and deliver stuff. Short, wide and outside off, Lynn says thank you very much and bashes it through cover",Mujeeb to Chris Lynn,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,10.2,"Ashwin to Karthik, FOUR, nicely played by DK, this was flighted well outside off, Karthik went down low, rolled his wrists over and slog sweeps it past mid-wicket, beats the fielder getting across from deep mid-wicket",Ashwin to Karthik,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,10.3,"Ashwin to Karthik, FOUR, lovely, has to be the shot of the day so far. Even Ashwin looks perplexed, this was tossed up nicely outside off, Karthik leant forward, played with the turn and drove it wide of mid-wicket, split the two men in the deep to perfection",Ashwin to Karthik,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,11.1,"Yuvraj to Karthik, FOUR, cheeky and four, slower and wider of off, Karthik waits on it, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and runs it past short third man, no need to run for those",Yuvraj to Karthik,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,11.3,"Yuvraj to Chris Lynn, FOUR, that's powerfully struck! Yuvraj dropped this one short and just outside off, Lynn backs away and bludgeons past the bowler, the fielder at long-off had no chance",Yuvraj to Chris Lynn,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,12.3,"Andrew Tye to Chris Lynn, FOUR, cracking shot, Tye is running out of ideas, back of a length and well wide of off, Lynn gets on top of the bounce and clatters it over cover-point",Andrew Tye to Chris Lynn,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,13.1,"Mujeeb to Karthik, FOUR, the boundaries are flowing for KKR, fraction short and sliding down the leg-side, Karthik went half-way down and pulled it behind square on the on-side, the man in the deep was square and has no chance",Mujeeb to Karthik,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,14.5,"Ashwin to Chris Lynn, FOUR, dropped short and wide of off, Lynn makes room and cuts it square past point. Sran has a lot of distance to cover, he slides and pulls the ball back in. The third umpire has several looks and reckons that his boot was touching the ropes as he pushed it back into play, given as a boundary",Ashwin to Chris Lynn,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,16.3,"Barinder to A Russell, FOUR, easy pickings for Russell, Barinder misses the yorker by an inch, turns out to be a swinging full-toss, Russell cleared his left leg, got his bat down and punched it back past the non-striker",Barinder to A Russell,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,16.4,"Barinder to A Russell, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Russell, the slower short ball from Sran, but it was short and way down the leg-side, Russell swivels across and pulls it over backward square leg, couple of bounces and over the ropes",Barinder to A Russell,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,17.0,"Barinder to Shubman Gill, FOUR, cracking shot, short and wide of off, Gill gets on top of the bounce and cuts it square past point, beat the diving fielder and raced away to the fence in a hurry",Barinder to Shubman Gill,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,17.1,"Rajpoot to Karthik, FOUR, that's a poor start from Rajpoot, short and wide of off, Karthik waited on that, played with an open face and beat Mujeeb's dive at short third man",Rajpoot to Karthik,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,17.2,"Rajpoot to Karthik, FOUR, cheeky and four, this is excellent cricket from Karthik, fraction too short and wide of off, Karthik waits on it, opens the face of the bat and runs it past the keeper",Rajpoot to Karthik,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,18.0,"Rajpoot to Shubman Gill, FOUR, beautifully played, too much of width on offer and Gill doesn't let it go. Prods across and crashes it square past cover, the man in the deep has no chance. 17 runs from the over, a terrible one from Rajpoot",Rajpoot to Shubman Gill,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,2.1,"Rajpoot to Uthappa, FOUR, edged but just eludes Gayle's outstretched right-hand. Rajpoot gains trampoline bounce outside off with this back of a length delivery, Uthappa pokes with hard hands and outside-edges it towards Gayle, who was at a widish slip. Gingerly stretched his right hand but it escaped away to the fence",Rajpoot to Uthappa,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,3.2,"Mujeeb to Uthappa, FOUR, adventure from Uthappa. Deals another flatter ball by bringing out the reverse sweep. Picked the length early and broomed it away to the third man fence. Key was he rolled his wrists there",Mujeeb to Uthappa,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,3.3,"Mujeeb to Uthappa, FOUR, two fours in a row for Uthappa. Sliding down leg as Rahman corrects his line. Uthappa drags the sweep, more of the bottom. But it beats short fine leg and races away to the fence",Mujeeb to Uthappa,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,3.4,"Mujeeb to Uthappa, FOUR, this was more streaky and Uthappa won't mind. Hat-trick of fours. Quick and skidded through, Uthappa was stuck on the back foot, looked to work it to the leg-side. Ends up squirting it more off the inner half and it eludes short fine leg, who's chase is vain in the end",Mujeeb to Uthappa,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,4.3,"Barinder to Chris Lynn, FOUR, the slower version of Sran's slower ball, Lynn didn't read it as he was early into the shot. But got it off the meat as he went for the pull and sent it behind square on the leg-side. No-one there and he'll collect a boundary",Barinder to Chris Lynn,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,5.5,"Andrew Tye to Uthappa, FOUR, this was out of the top draw. The slower delivery from Tye, on a short of length around middle and leg. Knuckle ball to be precise. Uthappa picked it early, with a roundhouse and helped it over short fine leg. Easy-peasy",Andrew Tye to Uthappa,FOUR
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,7.3,"Barinder to Chris Lynn, FOUR, brute force from Lynn. Such quicksilver hands. Was a decent delivery as Sran saw Lynn back away to leg and fired it wider of off. But the Australian threw the kitchen sink and managed to stroke it over extra cover",Barinder to Chris Lynn,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,0.1,"Shivam Mavi to Rahul, FOUR, oh almost chopped on and what a good first ball that was Shivam Mavi the young Shivam Mavi. Pacy, good length, seam pretty straight and just tailing back in and it seriously tests Rahul. He wanted to go for the drive, the feet weren't fully forward, lucky that the edge escaped past the off stick. Troubled by the movement in to him on that occasion",Shivam Mavi to Rahul,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,0.2,"Shivam Mavi to Rahul, FOUR, now that's brilliant placement from Rahul. Third man up, so Rahul uses the width on offer on this good length delivery, allows the ball to come and guides it to the left of backward point and it came from the middle of the bat as well",Shivam Mavi to Rahul,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,1.1,"A Russell to Rahul, FOUR, this is the thing about classy batsmen. They have this silken touch. Rahul hardly had a real go at this length delivery, just came forward and went through with an extended forward push, but found the middle of the bat or close to it and got it wide of the man at cover",A Russell to Rahul,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,1.2,"A Russell to Rahul, FOUR, this is unfair on the bowler. He's actually surprised Rahul with extra bounce on this short of length delivery, but Rahul managed to play with an angled bat at the last moment, third man was inside the ring again and there was no protection in the deep",A Russell to Rahul,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,1.4,"A Russell to Gayle, FOUR, Dre Russ vs Gayle and Gayle hits a four first ball. Russell missed the yorker there, bowled a juicy full ball and Gayle just placed the square-drive to the left of point, didn't try to hit that hard and this outfield is quick enough",A Russell to Gayle,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,2.2,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, FOUR, a boundary but this was hardly middled by Gayle. The bowler actually won a mini battle there, tried the outswinger, but that didn't swing much, the angle away troubled Gayle, who wanted to smash this over long-off, the ball hits the outside half of the bat and flies over cover-point",Shivam Mavi to Gayle,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,2.4,"Shivam Mavi to Gayle, FOUR, that's sloppy from Narine, should have been stopped. Again Gayle fails to time the ball, this was a good length delivery that rushed, the ball took the inside edge of the bat and escaped wide of mid-wicket",Shivam Mavi to Gayle,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,3.4,"A Russell to Gayle, FOUR, look at the frustration on Russell's face. He thought of outsmarting Gayle by taking pace off the ball, but Gayle cleverly delayed the shot. He moved leg-side early, but held the pose for a bit and then cut it between point and cover-point. Expertly done",A Russell to Gayle,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,5.0,"Narine to Gayle, FOUR, that's the over spoiled, tried the offie again but sprayed it down the leg-side, fine leg was inside the ring and Gayle happily helps it on its way over short fine leg. Gee he's looking ominous",Narine to Gayle,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,5.4,"Chawla to Rahul, FOUR, hey Sunil! Gotta move buddy! Rahul went back and pulled this short ball fine, Narine was at short fine leg, he hardly moved, should have tried at least, instead he put his arm out to the man in the deep, who clearly had no chance",Chawla to Rahul,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,5.5,"Chawla to Rahul, FOUR, this guy is striking them at 264 and bits but doesn't play rash shots. That's the feature of his batting. Spots the field, fine leg is inside, so he allows the ball to come, the line was down the leg-side and he just helped it away fine past the keeper",Chawla to Rahul,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,6.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Rahul, FOUR, absolutely no mercy from Rahul. Well, a rank long hop doesn't deserve respect anyway. Rahul quickly rocks back and pulls powerfully, splits long-on and deep mid-wicket quite easily",Kuldeep Yadav to Rahul,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,9.2,"Narine to Rahul, FOUR, Rahul wants to finish this off early. Bravely races down the pitch and forces Narine to shorten the length, it was well outside off stump, but Rahul reached out and cut it away past cover",Narine to Rahul,FOUR
4053491,KXIP 1st Inns,9.3,"Narine to Rahul, FOUR, cut away fiercely past point and a big roar from the crowd! Who are they supporting? Quicker delivery outside off stump, Rahul goes back and cuts really hard",Narine to Rahul,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,11.0,"Woakes to Pant, FOUR, that four evens out the over. Once more Woakes goes for the fuller length and with mid-off inside the ring he was taking a risk, Pant hammers the drive straight of mid-off and collects the boundary",Woakes to Pant,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,12.4,"Siraj to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, top shot! Full delivery at 146kph, but Iyer had made some room to open up the off-side field, lofts it without much footwork over extra cover and pocketed a much needed boundary",Siraj to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,16.1,"Woakes to Rahul Tewatia, FOUR, edged and four. Third man is square and Tewatia got it fine enough to beat him. Just a good length delivery angled across the left-hander, Tewatia went hard on the drive and the outside edge went away quickly to the fence",Woakes to Rahul Tewatia,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,16.4,"Woakes to Rahul Tewatia, FOUR, just over. A mistimed shot that clears the backtracking mid-off fielder. Slanted across off, Tewatia made a bit of room and sliced the drive over Siraj, who put in a desperate dive and still couldn't get there",Woakes to Rahul Tewatia,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,17.0,"Woakes to Pant, FOUR, fifty for Pant. Mighty fine innings from the youngster. But with three overs to go he needs to keep going. Short of length delivery and Pant was early into his swivel-pull, off the toe-end and past the man at 45",Woakes to Pant,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,18.4,"Woakes to Pant, leg byes, FOUR, does not matter how they come as long as the runs keep coming for DD. The back of a length delivery on middle and leg, Pant swivels to play the pull, misses and the ball lobs off thigh pad over de Kock",Woakes to Pant,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,18.5,"Woakes to Pant, FOUR, geez! AB would be proud of that shot. The reverse scoop. Yes, he has played a reverse scoop off a fast bowler. Woakes went full and wide outside off, Pant kept his balance and spooned it over short third man. Even Kohli seemed impressed with that shot",Woakes to Pant,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,19.0,"Woakes to Pant, FOUR, another costly death over for RCB, 18 off it. The off-pace short of length delivery, Pant spotted it early, shuffled across to get inside the line and pulled it over short fine, once it cleared the fielder there was no stopping that",Woakes to Pant,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,19.5,"Corey Anderson to Rahul Tewatia, FOUR, premeditation from Tewatia. Walked across his stumps even before Anderson bowled the ball, it was outside off and he still managed to lap it over short fine. Umesh gives chase and can only escort it to the fence",Corey Anderson to Rahul Tewatia,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,4.3,"U Yadav to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, first one of the night! Short one on middle and leg, Iyer drags it away to deep square leg to score the first boundary of the match",U Yadav to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,4.5,"U Yadav to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, back of a length well outside off, Iyer reaches for it and slams it through the gap at covers, that's his second boundary, and Delhi's second boundary too",U Yadav to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,5.5,"Chahal to Pant, FOUR, slammed away! Rishabh Pant announces his arrival at the crease in style. Picks the length early, camps back and punches it firmly through the gap at cover to get off the mark with a boundary",Chahal to Pant,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,7.3,"Washington Sundar to Pant, FOUR, reverse swept! Flighted one around off, Pant goes down on his knee and reverse sweeps it past the man at backward point to score a boundary, did well to connect his shot and past the fielder",Washington Sundar to Pant,FOUR
7791285,DC 1st Inns,8.3,"U Yadav to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, width on offer and that's been put away. Short and wide outside off, Iyer goes back in the crease and cuts it nicely through point. Sweeper cover sprints across in order to save it but fails in his quest",U Yadav to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,0.3,"Boult to de Kock, FOUR, that's sweet from de Kock. Exquisite timing. Good length ball curling away from off, de Kock caresses it on the up through the covers. Just had to find the gap there, races away on this outfield",Boult to de Kock,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,10.2,"Harshal Patel to de Villiers, FOUR, 137kph on the pads. And it doesn't even pitch. Oh my. de Villiers's swipes, heaving it into square leg, flat",Harshal Patel to de Villiers,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,12.2,"Harshal Patel to de Villiers, FOUR, gets well across, wanting to go over mid-wicket. And typically changes his mind, like only he can. Ruins a wide yorker, slicing it through extra cover all of a sudden. Just sublime. And yes, a fifty .. he's killing the contest",Harshal Patel to de Villiers,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,14.4,"Chris Morris to de Villiers, FOUR, the carnage. Morris loses it down leg, the last hit has mentally scarred him. And is mowed away, fine",Chris Morris to de Villiers,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,16.5,"Chris Morris to Mandeep, FOUR, blame Mandeep for stealing AB's century. A fullish length and he throws every ounce of his muscle to cart it straight down. Roy chases, dives, and has probably cut himself on the rope. Yeah, none of it could stop the boundary though",Chris Morris to Mandeep,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,17.5,"Boult to de Villiers, FOUR, beautifully played, fraction short and just outside off, AB arches back and then ramps over third man, couple of bounces and over the ropes",Boult to de Villiers,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,18.0,"Boult to de Villiers, FOUR, it's it. Lays into a half volley, screeching it through the covers, beating the leather off it. And RCB begin their move up",Boult to de Villiers,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,4.2,"Nadeem to Kohli, FOUR, massive moment in the game. Tentative defence from Kohli, the ball turns away from him to take the edge which goes between keeper and slip. Was Morris standing too wide? He barely had time to move before it went through. Nadeem doesn't know what to do",Nadeem to Kohli,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,4.5,"Nadeem to de Villiers, FOUR, there he goes. De Villiers is underway. Walks across the stumps, gets down low and wallops the sweep through square leg",Nadeem to de Villiers,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,5.0,"Nadeem to de Villiers, FOUR, now clears his front leg and lofts it inside-out over the covers. The off-side field is up and Nadeem has bowled to his field by drifting it in on middle, but AB is just too good",Nadeem to de Villiers,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,6.4,"Nadeem to de Villiers, FOUR, swept away for four. De Villiers has started off brilliantly. Nadeem lands it on a length for him and is dispatched",Nadeem to de Villiers,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,6.5,"Nadeem to de Villiers, FOUR, my word, how's this gone for four! Crazy. Unbelievable power with the bottom hand. He seemed to be cramped on the back foot but is somehow able to whip it between long-on and deep mid-wicket",Nadeem to de Villiers,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,7.0,"Nadeem to de Villiers, FOUR, hat-trick of fours! Nadeem is clueless against AB at the moment. He tosses this up wide - the best thing he can think off - but AB still walks across and powers the sweep through square leg. Crowd going wild",Nadeem to de Villiers,FOUR
7791285,RCB 1st Inns,7.1,"Chris Morris to Kohli, FOUR, now Kohli joins in the fun. Not great from Morris actually. Can't feed him on the pads with a length ball, gets flicked away in a flash to the boundary",Chris Morris to Kohli,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,10.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Raina, FOUR, beautifully played, will this help Raina break the shackles? Comes down the track, makes room as he did so and goes inside out over cover, one bounce and over the ropes. 13 came from the over",Bhuvneshwar to Raina,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,10.1,"Deepak Hooda to Rayudu, FOUR, CSK gaining some momentum and it is the local boy - Rayudu who is leading the charge, flighted delivery around off, Rayudu reverse sweeps it backward of point and starts the over with a boundary",Deepak Hooda to Rayudu,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,12.5,"Shakib to Rayudu, FOUR, smashed! Flighted delivery and the idea from Shakib was to land it full enough to the blockhole, Rayudu had made room and that allowed him to open up his arms and strike it inside out over extra cover, no chance for the sweeper to stop that",Shakib to Rayudu,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,13.2,"Stanlake to Rayudu, FOUR, cracking shot! Once again the shuffle across aiding him. It is Stanlake's favourite length but he offers width on this occasion, Rayudu capitalizes and unleashes a powerful cut shot behind point, raced away to the fence",Stanlake to Rayudu,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,13.4,"Stanlake to Rayudu, FOUR, edged and four. That is what pace does. Short and outside off, Rayudu made room this time and threw this kitchen sink at it, the thickish outside edge runs away fine beating the fielder in the deep",Stanlake to Rayudu,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,14.0,"Stanlake to Rayudu, FOUR, massive over for CSK, 19 runs off it. It is another edge and another boundary for Rayudu. He runs down the wicket and looks to force the back of a length delivery through the off-side, the outside edge runs away quickly to the third man fence",Stanlake to Rayudu,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,14.5,"Shakib to Rayudu, FOUR, now he is playing with the field. Walked across his stumps to the flighted delivery, sat down and broomed it backward of square leg, struck it fine enough to beat the man in the deep",Shakib to Rayudu,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,15.3,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, FOUR, wrong 'un is dragged down and Rayudu was waiting for it in the crease, cleared his front leg and pulled it in front of square, bisecting the two fielders in the deep comfortably",Rashid Khan to Rayudu,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,16.0,"Rashid Khan to Raina, FOUR, Raina does not want to be left out. He hangs back to this wrong 'un and since the ball is turning it away, it offers him the room to slap it past the diving extra cover fielder. Long-off can only pick the ball up from the fence",Rashid Khan to Raina,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,16.3,"S Kaul to Rayudu, FOUR, wow! We saw Rishabh Pant play the reverse paddle yesterday, today it is Rayudu. This is more deft than Pant's powerful strike. Knuckle ball and Rayudu just bent down, reverse lapped it fine to the third man fence",S Kaul to Rayudu,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,17.2,"Rashid Khan to Dhoni, FOUR, almost cleaned up Raina at the other end. The leg-break is right in the slot for him, small step forward and murders the ball straight back, Raina was ducking for cover and the fielder at long-on didn't even try to chase that",Rashid Khan to Dhoni,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,18.0,"Rashid Khan to Raina, FOUR, poor bowling from Rashid. Very rarely does that happen. But he has had two off days back to back. Went for 55 against KXIP and today ends with 1/49. Short and down leg, all Raina had to do was help it past the fielder at short fine, he does so with utter ease",Rashid Khan to Raina,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,18.1,"S Kaul to Dhoni, FOUR, top-edge and four. Not where he intended but Dhoni starts the over with a boundary. He was rushed by a short delivery and the pull is late, the edge goes away fine and he asks the umpire whether it is one for the over, the square leg umpire nods in approval",S Kaul to Dhoni,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,18.3,"S Kaul to Raina, FOUR, fifty for Raina. A very unlike Raina innings. He bided his time before he got going. Now is well set to take CSK past the 180-mark. The knuckle ball with width on offer, Raina just laces the cut square on the off-side. The sweeper is straighter than usual and he doesn't get there in time",S Kaul to Raina,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,18.5,"S Kaul to Dhoni, FOUR, Kaul has his hands on his hip. Not much he can do there. Just the class of Dhoni. A low full toss outside off, Dhoni opens the bat face and carves it past the diving short third man fielder",S Kaul to Dhoni,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,4.3,"Stanlake to Raina, FOUR, risky but four, Raina backed away a long way, Stanlake followed him with a full ball, but Raina has enough room to free his arms and drives it square behind point, beats third man getting across for his first boundary",Stanlake to Raina,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,5.1,"S Kaul to du Plessis, FOUR, on a length and well outside off, du Plessis comes down the track, doesn't get anywhere close to the pitch - but has enough to clear cover with the lofted drive, the timing wasn't great, but the ball has enough to beat the chasing pack",S Kaul to du Plessis,FOUR
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,7.3,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, FOUR, that's brave from Rayudu, but he knew what he was doing, fetches this well tossed up delivery from well and slogs it over mid-wicket, there's no one in the deep and Rayudu gets going with a boundary",Rashid Khan to Rayudu,FOUR
4976077,SRH 1st Inns,1.4,"SN Thakur to Williamson, FOUR, first boundary of the innings! Williamson makes the most of the provided width. It's a short of a length delivery outside off, Williamson reaches for it and slams it through the gap at cover-point to gather his first boundary of the innings",SN Thakur to Williamson,FOUR
4976077,SRH 1st Inns,17.1,"Dwayne Bravo to Y Pathan, FOUR, very wide on the crease goes Bravo, but he loses his line. He strays this short of length delivery right into Pathan's chest. There's no fine leg in place, or if there is, it's not fine. Pathan helps this pull into the ropes",Dwayne Bravo to Y Pathan,FOUR
4976077,SRH 1st Inns,19.5,"Dwayne Bravo to Rashid Khan, FOUR, they're still in this. Quite unbelievable. Full length ball outside off, Rashid swings for the rafters and sends a thick edge flying past short third man",Dwayne Bravo to Rashid Khan,FOUR
4976077,SRH 1st Inns,2.0,"SN Thakur to Williamson, FOUR, classic shot by Kane. Another short delivery well outside off, looking the class of Williamson he won't miss out. Plays a perfect square cut and pierces the gap at cover-point to end the over",SN Thakur to Williamson,FOUR
4976077,SRH 1st Inns,3.4,"SN Thakur to Williamson, FOUR, pulled away! Short of a length around off, Williamson camps back and pulls it nicely through the gap at mid-wicket, was timed sweetly by the skipper",SN Thakur to Williamson,FOUR
4976077,SRH 1st Inns,4.0,"SN Thakur to Williamson, FOUR, boundary to end the over. Just the over Sunrisers were looking for. Thakur drops it short again and has to pay the price for it as Williamson rocks back in order to pull it over mid-wicket, yet again...",SN Thakur to Williamson,FOUR
4976077,SRH 1st Inns,5.2,"Watson to Shakib, FOUR, off the mark with a boundary. That's not enough though. Needs a few more of them and get going. Picks the length early on this short one and pulls it in front of deep square leg who's too square in order to cut it off",Watson to Shakib,FOUR
4976077,SRH 1st Inns,7.5,"Chahar to Shakib, FOUR, he's bowled 17 dot balls so it's okay if he concedes a boundary or two. Has been an excellent spell by Chahar this. Short of a length around off, Shakib jumps in his crease and cuts it away to the third man fence, beat the man in the deep quite comfortably",Chahar to Shakib,FOUR
4976077,SRH 1st Inns,8.2,"Jadeja to Williamson, FOUR, fine square cut by Williamson again. Was short and wide outside off and the Sunrisers skipper did well to time his cut as he beat sweeper cover with ease",Jadeja to Williamson,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,10.2,"Stokes to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, he's been superb with the pick-up shots today. Anything on the pads, SKY has dispatched it disdainfully. Here's another instance. Full down leg, Suryakumar gets across and whips it cleanly behind square. In the gap and zooms away to the fence",Stokes to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,11.4,"Gowtham to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, Yadav shows off his cheekiness. Manufactured room out of nowhere. Pushed through quicker outside off, Suryakumar went deep and sliced it in the gap between short third man and backward point. Threaded the gap beautifully",Gowtham to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,12.1,"Jofra Archer to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, wonderful from Kishan. ""Such a dynamic player he is"" is the comment from Isa Guha on air. Greets Archer to the crease by chipping down the track, takes it on the full and lofted it with a clean swing of the arms over mid-off",Jofra Archer to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,13.3,"Unadkat to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, more clumsy effort from RR in the field. Gopal, the guilty culprit this time, who lets it through. Kishan moved across on this occasion and helped this short of length delivery to short fine leg. Gopal was lazy to bend low and didn't get his body behind the line of the ball. Sneaked through his legs and off to the fence",Unadkat to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,17.1,"Unadkat to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, excellent from the senior Pandya. How late he played that? Didn't have any room there at all to free his arms. So, he stayed back, opened his bat face and glided it in the gap between short third man and backward point",Unadkat to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,18.3,"Jofra Archer to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, ouch. Take cover Rod Tucker, Hardik knocked off his head nearly. Very full on off, the slower ball at 123.1 kph, Hardik gets under it and hammered it straight down the ground ferociously. Tucker take evasive action and is on the floor",Jofra Archer to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,19.4,"Stokes to Pollard, FOUR, Stokes is not happy with the effort by Gowtham. Should've stopped definitely. Pollard whacked it wide of long-on, Gowtham gets across, puts in the dive but doesn't stop it",Stokes to Pollard,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,3.5,"Jofra Archer to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, 144.5kph, that's nicely picked away off the hips by Suryakumar Yadav. Another pacy short of length delivery, actually on the stumps, but Suryakumar got inside the line and helped it away past the man at 45",Jofra Archer to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,5.0,"D Kulkarni to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, looked like it was going to either short third man or backward point for a moment, but Ishan Kishan has managed to split them with this uppish cut. Poor delivery from Kulkarni, gave too much width. Mumbai have picked up pace",D Kulkarni to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,5.1,"Unadkat to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, massive space for sale beyond mid-wicket and Suryakumar Yadav, who is not afraid to walk across the stumps, meets this length ball with a flick to the right of mid-wicket and greets Unadkat with a boundary first up",Unadkat to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,7.0,"Gowtham to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, this time he connects with the sweep, he actually played this with one hand. This line is a little more straighter than the previos one, Suryakumar hits the big gap at deep backward square leg",Gowtham to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,7.3,"Shreyas Gopal to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, Archer dives but fails to stop the ball at deep mid-wicket. Short delivery on the stumps, Suryakumar pulls, deep mid-wicket runs to his left, actually got there but made a mess of it",Shreyas Gopal to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7308498,MI 1st Inns,9.1,"Shreyas Gopal to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, Ishan knows he's going to bowl short, it's down the leg side and he helps himself to a boundary with a pull shot behind square on the on-side",Shreyas Gopal to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,0.3,"McClenaghan to R Tripathi, FOUR, there's a short fine leg in place but this leg-stump delivery deserves nothing less than a boundary. Tripathi crouches and glances it wide of the fielder at 45",McClenaghan to R Tripathi,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,11.0,"McClenaghan to Stokes, FOUR, now the overcook. McClenaghan tries sneaking in a quiet one, wide, full. Can't. Stokes' up there smart, reaching out and drilling it through extra cover. Here's the move on .. 16 runs in it",McClenaghan to Stokes,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,13.2,"Mustafizur to Stokes, FOUR, sits up perfectly. Stokes up there tall, already given himself loads of room and carts it over the covers. Nothing streaky here",Mustafizur to Stokes,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,14.3,"Hardik Pandya to Samson, FOUR, latches on. It's that sitting up length, and Samson goes flat-batted, riding the bounce and timing the leather off it through cow corner, splitting the two men converging. In the hope of converging",Hardik Pandya to Samson,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,18.0,"Mustafizur to Gowtham, FOUR, edge. And the Royals have a massive edge of life. 15 off this one and all of a sudden there's oxygen still there in this one. A low full toss, across Gowtham, who throws his bat out in an attempt to slice. He'll make his peace with the edge, running past the keeper",Mustafizur to Gowtham,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,18.1,"Bumrah to Jofra Archer, FOUR, very, very Caribbean. Okay former Caribbean. Archer transfer back, lets the ball get on par and waits on his drive, opening it to pierce the gap behind point. And that gap is huge",Bumrah to Jofra Archer,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,18.4,"Bumrah to Gowtham, FOUR, utter disdain. Take that .. width, pace and it is back in that point zone. Thumped hard. How things turn",Bumrah to Gowtham,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,19.0,"Bumrah to Gowtham, FOUR, goes pulling. And goes into the gap. Doesn't get enough meat, and thank heavens for that. It goes a lot finer, beating square leg in the ring. It's 10 off the final over. And you thought this was over, twice",Bumrah to Gowtham,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,19.2,"Hardik Pandya to Gowtham, FOUR, top thinking. He's spotted third man inside the ring, and ramps his bat out to shove it over. Wrong line, wrong length",Hardik Pandya to Gowtham,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,2.4,"Krunal Pandya to Samson, FOUR, now what do I call that.. Will be an outside edge to the naive but this has been cleverly played late and just wide of the keeper. Bat face opens at the last minute and Krunal Pandya's grounded. Sort of. We'll see",Krunal Pandya to Samson,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,3.3,"Mustafizur to Samson, FOUR, full and wide, and the long-limbed Samson is not going to miss out. Reaches out, with footwork into a snooze, but who cares. It's all hands.

7308498,RR 1st Inns,4.5,"Krunal Pandya to Rahane, FOUR, proper Rahane. Early to load onto the front foot and then drills it away through covers. Nothing Krunal Pandya could have done, except maybe pitching it a bit shorter. But then Rahane might have come up with something else",Krunal Pandya to Rahane,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,6.0,"McClenaghan to Samson, FOUR, that's why you can't not like him. McClenaghan strategy is pretty obvious: Bowl it slow and angle it across, because there's third man and backward point waiting to cut the runs off. And Samson here has found the tiniest of gaps between the fielders. Beautifully done, opening the bat face just enough to cleave the fielders",McClenaghan to Samson,FOUR
7308498,RR 1st Inns,6.2,"Markande to Stokes, FOUR, this spins more, so this is the googly from back fo the hand. Stokes gets into a shape to sweep nicely and brooms it away through mid-wicket",Markande to Stokes,FOUR
7710423,DC 1st Inns,0.3,"Rajpoot to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, pumped over mid-off for first IPL runs. It wasn't as close as you want to hear it was. Chipped the loft over Ashwin, who's tall enough. Good use of the length ball and the slight width that Prithvi Shaw used to use his arms into effect",Rajpoot to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
7710423,DC 1st Inns,1.1,"Barinder to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, throws his hands at this wide ball that's been angled across by Barinder from over the wicket. And gets away. Backspins and beats the keeper to his left",Barinder to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
7710423,DC 1st Inns,1.2,"Barinder to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, wow, get the thesaurus out. That's been cracked away with utter disdain. Short and wide yeah, but look at the sound the bat makes. Pinches the slightest gap at point and lasers it away",Barinder to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
7710423,DC 1st Inns,1.5,"Barinder to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, that's a bit ambitious.. and he's gotten some lucky runs here. Stays back and wants a stylish and uppish back foot punch through covers. Not in control of the bounce and the outside edge flies over the lone slipper in place",Barinder to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
7710423,DC 1st Inns,11.2,"Ashwin to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, off-spin was working alright against Shreyas Iyer in the previous over for Ashwin and he gets whacked trying to bowl leg-spin. Short and wide, Shreyas absolutely nails it off the back foot wide of cover",Ashwin to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR

7710423,DC 1st Inns,16.4,"Barinder to Rahul Tewatia, FOUR, what a timely hit! He's moved across the stumps, got down on his knees and paddled the fast bowler around the corner through backward square leg. Brave hit!

7710423,DC 1st Inns,19.5,"Mujeeb to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, inside edgeeee and it's past the dive at short fine leg. Lucky boundary and it's down to 5 runs off the last ball. Shreyas races down the pitch and slogs, gets a thick edge",Mujeeb to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
7710423,DC 1st Inns,2.4,"Rajpoot to Maxwell, FOUR, timing isn't something Maxwell has made a name out of, but if these continue, we'll need a rethink. Archaism, I tell you. Gets a delivery on the pads and times the hell out of it through mid-wicket",Rajpoot to Maxwell,FOUR
7710423,DC 1st Inns,6.5,"Rajpoot to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, short ball sitting up, and Shreyas Iyer pulls it with authority through deep mid-wicket",Rajpoot to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
7710423,DC 1st Inns,7.0,"Rajpoot to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, beautifully sliced wide of backward point's leap and that's been let through by Mujeeb, who's running across from third man. Covers the ground, slides but can't stop the ball. Was almost in control but then wasn't",Rajpoot to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,12.1,"Avesh Khan to Nair, FOUR, inside-out. That's some welcome. A wobbly seam off a length, looking to follow Nair as he backs away. But he goes uppish, lofting up a drive over extra cover",Avesh Khan to Nair,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,12.3,"Avesh Khan to Yuvraj, FOUR, 141kph. And an inside edge allows Yuvraj the move on. He tries going against the line, pulling, without judging the length not being short enough .. inside half, and Pant diving behind deflects it into fine leg",Avesh Khan to Yuvraj,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,15.5,"Mishra to Nair, FOUR, another one in anger. Oh Mishra, typically after a catch being put down takes his frustration out by going fast, on the pads and Nair cashes in with a sweep, drilling it perfectly to split the two fielders behind square",Mishra to Nair,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,17.1,"Christian to Miller, FOUR, to third man, splits the slips. One slower ball too many, Miller's already standing exposing his stumps, swings in desperation and the fat edge is enough to run through the cordon. Who'll plug these in the 18th over ..",Christian to Miller,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,17.4,"Christian to Andrew Tye, leg byes, FOUR, slower in on the pads. Tye can't connect, flicking well before it gets there, rebounds and runs very fine, under Pant's late dive",Christian to Andrew Tye,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,2.0,"Avesh Khan to Rahul, FOUR, streaky runs! Terrific end to what has been a sensational over from Avesh. On a good length just outside off, 143.7kph and Rahul was late on the forward push. Got a thick inside edge that just flew past leg stump and with fine leg really square, bonus runs for KXIP",Avesh Khan to Rahul,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,2.1,"Boult to Mayank Agarwal, FOUR, crashed away! Short of a length angling across Mayank, a bit of width and he stands tall to flay the cut through point. Cracking stroke!",Boult to Mayank Agarwal,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,2.2,"Boult to Mayank Agarwal, FOUR, delicious, absolutely delicious stroke! More width and the length is shorter as well, Mayank doesn't go hard at it, instead relies purely on timing and boy, didn't he time this or what? Stays back and guides it past the left of the backward point fielder and it raced away. Third man had no chance at all",Boult to Mayank Agarwal,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,2.4,"Boult to Rahul, FOUR, would have been a wide if Rahul left this but he chooses to go after it. Didn't time it well enough, still clears the infield on the off-side comfortably. Shorter length slower ball that was lifted over cover",Boult to Rahul,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,3.3,"Avesh Khan to Mayank Agarwal, FOUR, kabooom! Mayank is off the blocks in a flash once more. Short of a length outside off, he just backs away a bit and hammers it on the up through the covers. Found the gap well and nobody really budged",Avesh Khan to Mayank Agarwal,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,4.2,"Plunkett to Rahul, FOUR, up and over! Cannot bowl this length in the Powerplay, not on a true surface like this one. Half-volley and Rahul lifts it straight over the bowler's head. Perhaps not middled as much as he would have liked but still got enough on it",Plunkett to Rahul,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,5.1,"Avesh Khan to Nair, FOUR, glorious! Top quality stuff from Nair! Half volley from Avesh but look at the execution. Textbook front foot cover drive on the up. Brilliantly timed and picked the gap as well",Avesh Khan to Nair,FOUR
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,6.5,"Christian to Nair, FOUR, smart from Christian but Karun is smarter. Slower and short outside off, probably foxed the batsman initially but he adjusted well in the end. Stood tall and waited before guiding it past short third man. Mishra was probably a bit slow as well to come down on the slide and Christian clearly wasn't happy with the effort",Christian to Nair,FOUR
6197357,MI 1st Inns,1.1,"Nabi to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, poor delivery to start off. Short and wide outside off, Suryakumar Yadav reaches for it and punches it firmly through the gap at cover",Nabi to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
6197357,MI 1st Inns,11.3,"Rashid Khan to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, short and wide, Krunal takes full toll of it, rocks back and nails the cut behind square",Rashid Khan to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
6197357,MI 1st Inns,17.5,"S Kaul to Bumrah, FOUR, angled in, all Bumrah needed to do was help the ball finds its direction, he swivels and manages decent contact on the pull to slam the ball backwards of square leg",S Kaul to Bumrah,FOUR
6197357,MI 1st Inns,2.1,"Sandeep Sharma to Lewis, FOUR, timed to perfection that was. Short of a length delivery angled away with a bit of away swing too, Lewis sits back in his crease and punches it through the gap at cover. Was in the air for a while but the placement was pretty good",Sandeep Sharma to Lewis,FOUR
6197357,MI 1st Inns,3.3,"Nabi to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, shot, good shot! Picks the length early on that. Was a shortish delivery outside off, Suryakumar doesn't miss out on it and slaps it towards mid-off. Thampi who's manning that position slips as the ball beats him and goes through. That won't please the bowler",Nabi to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
6197357,MI 1st Inns,7.4,"Nabi to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, he's been playing so well since he has been promoted. This was played very late by Suryakumar. Was a quicker delivery outside off, he went back in his crease and guided it sweetly past the man at short third man. No chance of stopping that",Nabi to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
6197357,MI 1st Inns,7.5,"Nabi to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for the opener. Picks the length early on the shortish delivery, rocks back and slams it into the gap at cover. Sweeper cover is too square to cut it off as the ball wins the race",Nabi to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
6197357,MI 1st Inns,8.1,"S Kaul to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, beautiful. What a cracking cover-drive that was. Full length delivery around off, Pandya transfers his weight on his right knee and creams it through cover. Right into the gap and the fielders could do nothing but admire the timing and placement on it",S Kaul to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
6197357,MI 1st Inns,8.5,"S Kaul to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, good competition between bat and ball, this. Short of a length around off, Pandya does well to pummel it past the man at mid-on and get a four more",S Kaul to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
6197357,MI 1st Inns,9.0,"S Kaul to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, poor delivery to end the over. Tries for a yorker and ends up bowling a full toss. Pandya doesn't miss out on the gift and drills it past the diving Williamson to gather the third boundary of the over. Expensive over by Kaul and Mumbai fans get their voice back",S Kaul to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,0.3,"Bumrah to Williamson, FOUR, magnificent shot. What a way to get off the mark. Wasn't a bad ball at all. On a back of a length and outside off, with extra bounce too, Williamson plays a top square cut, getting on top of the bounce and hitting the gap wide of cover-point",Bumrah to Williamson,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,0.4,"Bumrah to Williamson, FOUR, beauty! Williamson is in some form. Bumrah goes full and outside off, gets a hint of outswing too, Williamson though is almost on one knee as he bent forward and then opened the bat-face at the last moment to essay a square drive that left cover-point as a spectator. Not much Bumrah can do when he gets to see two world-class shots like that. Credit to Williamson",Bumrah to Williamson,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,1.2,"McClenaghan to Dhawan, FOUR, where's third man? No-one there. On a length and outside off, Dhawan throws the bat at that and the edge flies away to the unmanned third man fence, Dhawan gets a boundary to get himself going",McClenaghan to Dhawan,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,12.4,"Krunal Pandya to Y Pathan, FOUR, poor delivery and cut away. Short and wide outside off, Pathan had to miss backward point and he did that. Races away once it moved past that fielder",Krunal Pandya to Y Pathan,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,2.3,"Bumrah to Manish Pandey, FOUR, a big confidence-booster for Manish Pandey. He wants runs and this is a fine shot. On the front foot and when he saw the back of a length delivery outside off, just knifed it on the rise. Through the vacant cover-point region for a boundary",Bumrah to Manish Pandey,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,3.2,"McClenaghan to Manish Pandey, FOUR, when it is pitched up, Manish Pandey looks to go over the top. Has come out with an aggressive intent. This was full outside off, he lofted it cleanly and wide of mid-on",McClenaghan to Manish Pandey,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,4.0,"McClenaghan to Manish Pandey, FOUR, clean and over mid-off. The same delivery that got Saha, but Manish Pandey is in and seeing it well tonight by the looks of it. Goes over mid-off with a full bat-swing and clears the fielder comfortably",McClenaghan to Manish Pandey,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,4.1,"Hardik Pandya to Williamson, FOUR, Williamson gets lucky. Very lucky. A thick inside edge that on another day would've gone onto the stumps, misses them and runs away wide of short fine leg. The fielder didn't dive as well. Good length and on off, Williamson was late on the attempted dab",Hardik Pandya to Williamson,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,6.0,"McClenaghan to Y Pathan, byes, FOUR, short, Pathan ducks under that and lets it go. Ishan Kishan is having a bad day in the office tonight. Leaps but can only parry it over and the ball runs away for four byes. Again off McClenaghan",McClenaghan to Y Pathan,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,6.2,"Hardik Pandya to Williamson, FOUR, brilliant back-cut. As late as possible. Williamson cutting the ball behind him and the pace on the ball beats the chasing and diving McClenaghan. Top shot that one",Hardik Pandya to Williamson,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,7.1,"Mustafizur to Williamson, FOUR, comical from KW. He hasn't realised that the ball has crossed the fence. Keeps running and then belatedly realises. But what a good pull shot that is. Rocketed off the bat, harmless short ball around waist height, Williamson murdered that and bisected the two men on the fence. Even a dive wasn't enough to stop the ball",Mustafizur to Williamson,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,8.4,"Hardik Pandya to Nabi, FOUR, can't seem to string 6 good balls in an over. Overpitched and Nabi doesn't miss out. Gets forward and strokes it wide of cover. Sweeper had no chance at all. Right off the middle of the bat",Hardik Pandya to Nabi,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,9.1,"Markande to Nabi, FOUR, too short and begging to be hit. Nabi rocks back and finds the gap between long-on and deep mid with a hard pull. Right into the gap",Markande to Nabi,FOUR
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,9.3,"Markande to Y Pathan, FOUR, googly but wrongly directed, starts from middle and goes down, Pathan helps the sweep with one hand off the bat handle, good enough though to take the ball away from the man at deep backward square",Markande to Y Pathan,FOUR
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,17.0,"Siraj to Dhoni, FOUR, finally, he guides this in the gap and that spoils a good over for Siraj. Bowled pretty well to be honest. Back of a length and outside off stump, Dhoni steers it between backward point and short third man",Siraj to Dhoni,FOUR
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,17.4,"Corey Anderson to Rayudu, FOUR, now then, now then, you can't bowl way too short and slow either. No sweeper cover remember, only third man and deep cover, so Rayudu stands tall, delays the cut and hits it over the infield",Corey Anderson to Rayudu,FOUR
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,19.1,"Corey Anderson to Dwayne Bravo, FOUR, that's the healthiest of edges you can get. Lucky runs. Precious runs for CSK. The yellow contingent believes. Ceee Esss Kayyy chants ringing in the ground. Shortish delivery outside off stump, Bravo slogs and gets a thick edge that flies over the leaping QdK",Corey Anderson to Dwayne Bravo,FOUR
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,3.5,"U Yadav to Raina, FOUR, that is an unbelievable shot. Especially if your name is Raina and you have a problem against the short ball. The world knows it. Yadav did nothing wrong there, followed the backing away Raina with a perfect short ball, but Raina turned on the style and forehanded like Rafa Nadal at Philippe Chatrier Roland Garros. So much topspin on the crosscourt and it swings and eludes wickedly past the great AB at mid-on. How he managed to get on top of the bounce and kept it down, only he will know",U Yadav to Raina,FOUR
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,4.2,"Siraj to Rayudu, FOUR, short and pulled away. Rayudu didn't hit it as well as he would've liked to, but gets a one bounce over the ropes four at deep square",Siraj to Rayudu,FOUR
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,4.4,"Siraj to Raina, FOUR, another amazing shot by Raina. Siraj with the double-teapot pose, wondering what he has done wrong. Raina down the track, in a flash and even when there's no room on the back of a length delivery, whiplashes the slash, gets it through cover and extra-cover. Right into the gap. Top batting",Siraj to Raina,FOUR
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,5.0,"Siraj to Rayudu, FOUR, belted straight down the ground. Rayudu knows what is coming from his Hyderabad teammate. Skips down and then brutalises the short of length delivery back over the bowler's head. Umpire was ducking for cover there",Siraj to Rayudu,FOUR
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,5.3,"U Yadav to Billings, FOUR, now Billings flicks and gets four. Over mid-wicket and it races away. On the pads, Billings relies on timing and goes up and over",U Yadav to Billings,FOUR
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,6.1,"Chahal to Billings, FOUR, pre-meditated and four. Knelt down and paddled it fine, beats the long chase and desperate dive of Corey Anderson at fine leg. Almost played it onto the stumps, but got it wide of de Kock",Chahal to Billings,FOUR
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,0.4,"Chahar to Kohli, FOUR, that's where Kohli is so good. Anything near his pads and he will not allow the bowler to get away. Full on leg stump and he just whipped it over mid-wicket. The uncorking of the wrists and the ball flew over the fielder",Chahar to Kohli,FOUR
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,1.3,"SN Thakur to Kohli, FOUR, didn't get all of it, but with the infield up, anything over them will be a boundary. Full outside off, Kohli wanted to go over extra-cover with the lofted hit, sort of sliced it, but had enough on it to clear the ring. Races away and the crowd get going as well",SN Thakur to Kohli,FOUR
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,10.1,"Tahir to de Villiers, FOUR, what batting. Must have picked it from the hand. Reverses the bat and sends the quicker dart outside off wide of short third. MS tried to get his legs in the way of the ball - as he always does, but placed so well",Tahir to de Villiers,FOUR
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,15.1,"Jadeja to Mandeep, byes, FOUR, wow! Missed stumping? What has happened to this game all of a sudden. Like a man on drugs. This ball opens Mandeep up completely, rips off middle and squares up the batsman, leaves MS clueless too, drift in and spin away, past everyone including slip and races away",Jadeja to Mandeep,FOUR
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,15.4,"Jadeja to Mandeep, FOUR, too slow and too much time for Mandeep to reverse lap it over short third. Well played",Jadeja to Mandeep,FOUR
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,18.0,"Dwayne Bravo to de Grandhomme, FOUR, top shot. Gets under this full delivery and manages to power it over mid-off. Well wide of him and four more",Dwayne Bravo to de Grandhomme,FOUR
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,2.5,"Chahar to Kohli, FOUR, 200 marks to Billings for the effort. But it is four. Flicked effortlessly by Kohli, races across the turf to deep mid-wicket, Billings dives and pushes it back in play, but the ball rolls back to touch the cushions as the Kent man tried to pull it back the second time. Kohli and de Kock assumed that it would go for four and had to rush to make the third. Eventually all that was not needed as the third umpire judges it correctly",Chahar to Kohli,FOUR
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,20.0,"Dwayne Bravo to Washington Sundar, FOUR, brilliant from Washington Sundar. These might be crucial runs. Could well be match-winning. This 10-odd runs he has managed in the last over. Wide length ball from Dwayne Bravo, Washington Sundar reached out and cut between the two men in the ring on the off-side. No-one sweeping out there and RCB end with 205",Dwayne Bravo to Washington Sundar,FOUR
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,5.5,"Harbhajan to de Villiers, FOUR, this time shows off his prowess over the backward point region. Harbhajan isn't afraid to flight it, even after getting hit, but de Villiers backs away and slices it over the infield, four more, just opened the bat face at the point of impact and eluded the horde of fielders in the ring",Harbhajan to de Villiers,FOUR
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,7.2,"Watson to de Kock, FOUR, back of a length around off, what a late-cut that is. Played it so late, almost behind him, splits backward point and short third to perfection. No third man and too wide for sweeper to get across",Watson to de Kock,FOUR
4782326,KXIP 1st Inns,15.4,"Sandeep Sharma to Andrew Tye, FOUR, dropped? Just fingertips I guess. Will go down as a missed opportunity. Andrew Tye walks out of his crease and clubs it straight down the ground, it kept teasing long-on and long-off, in the end Shakib from long-on decided to go for it, but didn't judge it well and it looped over his left shoulder",Sandeep Sharma to Andrew Tye,FOUR
4782326,KXIP 1st Inns,17.5,"Rashid Khan to Mujeeb, FOUR, okay let's try something fancy decides Mujeeb and he goes for the reverse slap over point. Connects it well and gets it to defeat the dive from sweeper cover to his left",Rashid Khan to Mujeeb,FOUR
4782326,KXIP 1st Inns,18.0,"Rashid Khan to Mujeeb, FOUR, another reverse slap. Over short third man this time. Sweetly timed or not, it goes over the fielder and trickles into the fence",Rashid Khan to Mujeeb,FOUR
4782326,KXIP 1st Inns,18.5,"S Kaul to Rajpoot, FOUR, typical agricultural slog from Ankit Rajpoot, shaves the inside edge and runs past the keeper to his left. Thampi from short fine chases...chases...and chases...Never getting there. Ball wins the race",S Kaul to Rajpoot,FOUR
4782326,KXIP 1st Inns,3.4,"Nabi to Rahul, FOUR, superb batting. This isn't all that short. But Rahul's footwork is excellent, enabling him to spear this cut shot through point",Nabi to Rahul,FOUR
4782326,KXIP 1st Inns,3.5,"Nabi to Rahul, FOUR, now anticipates a slightly fuller length, walks across the stumps and sweeps over short fine leg. Class batting from Rahul. He's out-thinking Nabi at every turn",Nabi to Rahul,FOUR
4782326,KXIP 1st Inns,4.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Rahul, FOUR, Rahul silences the crowd with a glorious cover drive. Wow. Not even all that full, but he leans into it languidly and creams it through extra cover",Sandeep Sharma to Rahul,FOUR
4782326,KXIP 1st Inns,5.2,"S Kaul to Rahul, FOUR, he's not got it off the middle, but the fact he's got it over mid-on is incredible. He wasn't to the pitch of the ball after charging out, but goes through with a very stylish straight-batted punch. His strokes make for such good viewing",S Kaul to Rahul,FOUR
4782326,KXIP 1st Inns,5.5,"S Kaul to Gayle, FOUR, yorker outside off, and it's sliced away through the gap. Gayle stretches out to reach it and opens the bat-face to get it between short third man and backward point",S Kaul to Gayle,FOUR
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,1.4,"Barinder to Dhawan, FOUR, cracking shot, width on offer from Sran and Dhawan was all over it. Reaches out on the drive and flat-bats it past cover, beat the infield and rolled away to the fence",Barinder to Dhawan,FOUR
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,12.2,"Andrew Tye to Shakib, FOUR, nicely played by Shakib, much needed boundary for SRH. Banged in short and just outside off, Shakib swivels across and helps it on its way, beats short fine and rolls away to the fence",Andrew Tye to Shakib,FOUR
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,14.4,"Ashwin to Manish Pandey, FOUR, bad misjudgement from Rajpoot in the deep. He lets this bounce in front of him and then weakly stretches out his hand, only to parry it over the ropes. Carrom ball on leg-stump from Ashwin, Pandey stood still and swiped it through square leg. Good contact",Ashwin to Manish Pandey,FOUR
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,18.2,"Andrew Tye to Manish Pandey, FOUR, had to make a big effort to get to this wide slower ball, and then manufactures remarkable power to cover it over extra-cover. Highly valuable fifty from Manish Pandey. It's given the Sunrisers a score",Andrew Tye to Manish Pandey,FOUR
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,18.5,"Andrew Tye to Y Pathan, FOUR, back of a length delivery on leg, Pathan helps it away past short fine leg. Tye immediately turned away, knew he had missed his mark horrendously",Andrew Tye to Y Pathan,FOUR
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,19.5,"Rajpoot to Nabi, FOUR, sliced away over backward point for four. Useful from Nabi. Full and wide delivery, Nabi just about reaches it and then cleverly opens the bat face",Rajpoot to Nabi,FOUR
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,2.0,"Barinder to Saha, FOUR, that's a poor ball from Sran, too full and on Saha's pads, all he had to do was to get some bat on that, he does and beats fine leg with ease. Expensive start from Sran, 11 came from the over",Barinder to Saha,FOUR
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,2.1,"Rajpoot to Dhawan, FOUR, chopped, short of a good length and just outside off, too close for Dhawan to play the cut, he gets a toe-edge and beats the lone slip, third man is square and has no chance",Rajpoot to Dhawan,FOUR
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,3.4,"Barinder to Manish Pandey, FOUR, whipped, length delivery on the leg-stumnp line, Manish makes room, gets his left leg out of the way and flicks it wristily past mid-wicket, off the mark with a boundary",Barinder to Manish Pandey,FOUR
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,5.2,"Barinder to Shakib, FOUR, the free-hit and it has been smashed away, high full-toss on Shakib's pads, he pulled it without much timing, but the placement was good, past square leg and into the fence",Barinder to Shakib,FOUR
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,5.4,"Barinder to Shakib, FOUR, short, wide and four, Shakib gets going after some luck, short and wide of off, he gets on top of the bounce, used Sran's pace and cracked it square behind point. Third man has no chance",Barinder to Shakib,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,10.3,"A Russell to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, cracking shot! This lad is putting up an exhibition tonight. Fractionally short from Russell and Shaw doesn't bother going on the back foot. Is on his initial front foot trigger as he clobbers the pull over mid-wicket. High quality!",A Russell to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,11.0,"A Russell to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, oh glorious! Another classy stroke! Not all that full but Shaw reaches out and absolutely pumps the drive straight back past the bowler. Mid-off could only see it whistling away to the fence. Gee!",A Russell to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,12.4,"Johnson to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, this time he does! Iyer gets third time lucky. Another shorter length delivery from Johnson and was perhaps a touch closer to Iyer who connected the ramp nicely. Over Karthik and very fine which means third man has no chance. Nice innovation",Johnson to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,14.4,"A Russell to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, great placement! Nobody in the deep behind square on the off-side and all Iyer had to do was beat the man in the ring. That he does with a fine back foot cut. Too short and wide, got the treatement",A Russell to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,19.0,"Johnson to Maxwell, FOUR, hammers this! Very full and outside off, Maxwell holds his shape and lifts it straight over the bowler's head. Dead straight and it rockets to the fence. 11 off the over, a good one but those three dot balls, will they hurt on this seemingly belter of a pitch? Another over left though to make up for it",Johnson to Maxwell,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,19.5,"Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, what a shot! He's been playing breathtaking strokes for fun tonight. Here is another of those. Fullish length and Iyer sits in the crease before and blasts it down the ground towards long-off. No chance for the fielder there",Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,2.1,"Chawla to Munro, FOUR, beautifully played, nicely tossed up on off, Munro gets a big stride forward, gets close to the ball and drives it back past the non-striker, beats mid-off and rolls away to the fence",Chawla to Munro,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,2.2,"Chawla to Munro, FOUR, streaky but four, tossed up slower and spinning away from outside off, Munro was making room on the inside out drive, doesn't cover for the spin and slices it over backward point, couple of bounces and over the fence",Chawla to Munro,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,2.4,"Chawla to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, lovely, how well did Prithvi read this leg break? This was tossed up well outside off and spun away, Prithvi gets a big stride forward, plays with the turn and goes inside out over cover, one bounce and over the ropes",Chawla to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,2.5,"Chawla to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Prithvi, Chawla dropped this one short and on the leg-stump line, pulled away hard and past square leg, beats the fielder getting across from the deep",Chawla to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,3.2,"Shivam Mavi to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, cracking shot, back of a length and just outside off, Prithvi stands tall, plays with a straight bat and punches, beats point and rolls away to the fence",Shivam Mavi to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,3.5,"Shivam Mavi to Munro, FOUR, clobbered, Munro comes down the track, that allows him to free his arms and deposits it back past the bowler, beat mid-on to his right and races away to the fence",Shivam Mavi to Munro,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,4.3,"Narine to Munro, FOUR, nicely played! It wasn't a bad ball from Narine, slower and on the off-stump line, Munro made room by backing away, waits on the ball and finds the gap past cover with a blazing drive",Narine to Munro,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,5.4,"Johnson to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, lovely, full and wide of off, Prithvi needs no second invitation as he threw his hands at that, clears cover-point and races away to the fence",Johnson to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6844921,DC 1st Inns,8.4,"Johnson to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, that's nicely played by Prithvi, let the ball come onto him, used the pace on the ball and then nudged it behind square on the on-side, beat the man in the ring and rolls away to the fence",Johnson to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,0.2,"Boult to Chris Lynn, FOUR, wrong lines from Trent Boult, pounds it short and sprays it around the ribcage, Lynn swivels and smacks the pull behind square",Boult to Chris Lynn,FOUR
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,1.3,"Maxwell to Narine, FOUR, no-one's preventing this one. Halftracker outside off stump, Narine transfers his weight onto the back foot and hammers it powerfully wide of extra cover",Maxwell to Narine,FOUR
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,10.3,"Plunkett to A Russell, FOUR, no fooling around this time! Stays back for the slower delivery and then thumps the ball away between mid-wicket and long-on for a four. That was out of the top-drawer from Russell",Plunkett to A Russell,FOUR
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,12.3,"Boult to A Russell, FOUR, not all brawn with this man. Stands up and steers the ball over point for a four. That runs away into the fence. The ball was short and outside off, the room was there to send it away",Boult to A Russell,FOUR
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,13.1,"Mishra to Shubman Gill, FOUR, dances down the track, picks up the googly and hoicks the ball away through mid-wicket and long-on for a four. KKR will take it, with open arms",Mishra to Shubman Gill,FOUR
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,14.3,"Rahul Tewatia to A Russell, FOUR, more perspiration on the part of the DD team. Well tossed up delivery and the batsman this time thumps the ball over the bowler's head for a four. That was brutal again",Rahul Tewatia to A Russell,FOUR
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,18.4,"Maxwell to Kuldeep Yadav, FOUR, down leg, swept fine and that will run away to the fence",Maxwell to Kuldeep Yadav,FOUR
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,19.5,"Boult to Johnson, FOUR, does not miss out on the timing despite backing away. Too full and the batsman screamed the drive away through the cover region for a four",Boult to Johnson,FOUR
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,20.0,"Boult to Johnson, FOUR, slogged away off a length ball towards the deep mid-wicket fence but does not matter. DD win this by 55 runs. This has been a superb show from DD, ably led by their new skipper - Shreyas Iyer. Two vital points and KKR have been jolted badly by this",Boult to Johnson,FOUR
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,4.0,"Avesh Khan to Nitish Rana, FOUR, that ball went searching for the middle of the blade. Nitish Rana was in such a good position, everything right about it; reads the length early, punches crisply in the gap behind point with a still head. Take four",Avesh Khan to Nitish Rana,FOUR
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,5.5,"Avesh Khan to Shubman Gill, FOUR, one bounce and over the ropes. Making batting look so simple is Shubman Gill. Waits for this length ball to arrive and lifts the punch over mid-off with impeccable timing",Avesh Khan to Shubman Gill,FOUR
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,9.5,"Mishra to Shubman Gill, FOUR, tad short and keeps eerily low on middle, but Gill does well to keep his eyes on the ball and slam the pull along the ground through mid-wicket. A diving effort by the fielder at deep mid-wicket goes in vain",Mishra to Shubman Gill,FOUR
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,10.1,"McClenaghan to Raina, FOUR, just wide of Ishan Kishan, but poor bowling from McClenaghan, sliding down and easy for Raina to get inside the line and help the ball with a faint tickle. Does enough to get it past the keeper",McClenaghan to Raina,FOUR
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,14.4,"Hardik Pandya to Dhoni, FOUR, wow. Incredible hands by Dhoni. And almost six. One bounce over the ropes. Full and with mid-off up was asking for trouble. Dhoni whiplashed it over the fielder. Raw power",Hardik Pandya to Dhoni,FOUR
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,14.5,"Hardik Pandya to Dhoni, FOUR, now goes over mid-wicket. Predictably Hardik Pandya pings it short, Dhoni is waiting on the back foot. Hammered the pull and there's no-one at deep mid. Takes another boundary. Intelligence and cricket awareness on display",Hardik Pandya to Dhoni,FOUR
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,15.2,"Markande to Dhoni, FOUR, that's the genius of Dhoni. He was beaten in flight and had he not reached out low and found bat on ball, would've given Kishan a chance for a stumping, but stretches to his full reach and then carves it over wide long-off, for a one bounce over the ropes four. Incredible",Markande to Dhoni,FOUR
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,16.2,"Bumrah to Raina, FOUR, fine leg was inside the circle and Raina gets four. Gets inside the line and then waits for the off-pace delivery which is short, pulled well wide of short fine",Bumrah to Raina,FOUR
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,16.4,"Bumrah to Raina, FOUR, and Raina will go wide and over that man. Helped by Bumrah bowling a low full-toss, on the pads, flicked into the gap and Raina gets to 50",Bumrah to Raina,FOUR
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,2.2,"McClenaghan to Watson, FOUR, that has been hit so hard. Rohit at mid-off dove to his right at mid-off, got a hand on that and took the sting out of the shot, but it still raced away to the fence. When Watson saw the pitched up delivery he just plonked his front foot and drilled it",McClenaghan to Watson,FOUR
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,3.4,"Hardik Pandya to Rayudu, FOUR, there's a backward point close in and then a short third man behind him, with no third man in place. Full outside off, Rayudu lashes a square drive in the air and manages to elude the leaping backward point fielder to his left",Hardik Pandya to Rayudu,FOUR
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,5.5,"Hardik Pandya to Rayudu, FOUR, slower delivery outside off, Rayudu slashes and gets a thick edge that bisects Ishan Kishan and Krunal at short third. Races away",Hardik Pandya to Rayudu,FOUR
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,6.1,"Krunal Pandya to Raina, FOUR, short and well outside off, Raina reaches out and cuts, beats backward point and sweeper cover has too much ground to cover. Beats him",Krunal Pandya to Raina,FOUR
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,8.3,"Cutting to Raina, FOUR, hat-trick of slower balls and so predictable. Raina gets forward and lofts over and wide of mid-off. So easy",Cutting to Raina,FOUR
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,9.4,"Markande to Raina, FOUR, too full and too close to Raina, who just lifts it back over the bowler's head. Hit clean and hard, no chance for long-off or long-on",Markande to Raina,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,0.2,"Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, too much width and Yadav latches onto it. Bit of away-shape for Chahar, but the length is on the shorter side. Too easy for any batsman. Yadav stands tall and slashes it through point. SKY and MI get off the mark",Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,13.0,"Dwayne Bravo to Lewis, FOUR, spoils a good over by smearing the ball into the wide long-off boundary. To be fair, Bravo was asking for it by bowling this gentle full toss outside off. Duly punished",Dwayne Bravo to Lewis,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,14.1,"Dwayne Bravo to Rohit, FOUR, the Mumbai captain is up for it tonight. He's taking control of this chase now. Short of length ball, only chest high, and Rohit dismisses it with an authoritative pull backward of square. Huge cheers. It's a split crowd here",Dwayne Bravo to Rohit,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,17.2,"Watson to Rohit, FOUR, not the best effort from Tahir in the deep, lets the ball sneak through for four. He's immediately removed from that position. Good length ball outside off, Rohit doesn't get all of it but does enough to carve it away through sweeper cover's dive",Watson to Rohit,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,18.2,"SN Thakur to Rohit, FOUR, low full toss outside off, Rohit ingeniously slices it away over backward point. Shades of the shot Dhoni played the other night, but not quite as good. He just about clears Harbhajan though. Thakur must be crestfallen, this was a perfectly good ball",SN Thakur to Rohit,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,18.3,"SN Thakur to Rohit, FOUR, that previous ball has messed his line up. This time he goes full at the stumps, Rohit shuffles inside the line of it and whips it away to the fine leg boundary. Top batting",SN Thakur to Rohit,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,18.4,"SN Thakur to Rohit, FOUR, hat-trick of fours. Rohit's doing it for Mumbai. Short of length ball outside off, slower one, and the MI skipper is able to thread it through backward point and third man. Brilliantly glided",SN Thakur to Rohit,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,19.0,"SN Thakur to Rohit, FOUR, kills the game off, surely. Tremendous batting from Rohit Sharma. He picks the bowler's mind, reads the incoming yorker and sweeps it away through backward square. Raises a fifty",SN Thakur to Rohit,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,2.0,"SN Thakur to Lewis, FOUR, that spoils the over. Not a bad ball by any means. Banged one short and generated good lift, Lewis is late on the pull, off the glove and well wide of MS. Runs away to the fine leg fence",SN Thakur to Lewis,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,2.1,"Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries. Length ball on the stumps, Yadav hops across and flicks it very fine. Bhajji is slightly too square and he can't cut it off",Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,2.4,"Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, nicely done! Ample time for Yadav to pick his spot. Normal-paced shortish ball, no venom in it. Yadav slightly crouches and elevates it over short third man",Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,3.2,"Watson to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, good placement. Just a bit of width outside off and that's enough for Yadav. Jumps, opens his bat-face at the last moment and forces it through backward point",Watson to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,4.5,"Harbhajan to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, width served and Yadav doesn't miss out. Was on the shorter side as well and Yadav used the bowler's pace to good effect. Opened the bat-face to punch it through covers. Excellent placement",Harbhajan to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,8.5,"Tahir to Lewis, byes, FOUR, through Dhoni and that runs away into the fence. Very rare from MS. It was the googly from Tahir and Lewis tries another lofted shot. Is nowhere close to the bat and misses. Was marginally outside the tramline as well. Brushed the CSK skipper's pad and that's four bonus runs for MI",Tahir to Lewis,FOUR
7417775,MI 1st Inns,9.0,"Tahir to Lewis, FOUR, a gift dished out and Lewis accepts it with both hands. He needed that. Connects and collects four. A rank full toss fired by Tahir and Lewis thumps it down the ground. Over the bowler's head and long-off had no chance",Tahir to Lewis,FOUR
7130109,RR 1st Inns,0.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Rahane, FOUR, nicely done by Rahane! This tailed in sharply from a fullish length but the line was a bit too straight. Clipped away sweetly past the diving mid-wicket fielder and it raced away to the fence. RR are away",Sandeep Sharma to Rahane,FOUR
7130109,RR 1st Inns,12.3,"Y Pathan to Rahane, FOUR, slipping down. That's the customary loose stuff a part-timer dishes out. Quick sweep, ensuring it goes very fine",Y Pathan to Rahane,FOUR
7130109,RR 1st Inns,19.1,"Basil Thampi to Gowtham, FOUR, gets his line wrong. Gets his length wrong. A yorker in the form of a half volley, the line stays on middle and Gowtham's hoick gets a fat inside edge, through his legs and through a vacant square leg",Basil Thampi to Gowtham,FOUR
7130109,RR 1st Inns,2.0,"Shakib to Rahane, FOUR, beautifully timed! Placement was spot on too. Got this wide of mid-on and well to the left of the deep mid-wicket fielder as well. A touch short around middle, skids off the deck and Rahane whips it away with strong wristwork. Nicely done by the skipper",Shakib to Rahane,FOUR
7130109,RR 1st Inns,3.1,"Basil Thampi to Samson, FOUR, delicious shot! Oozing class! Not all that bad a ball, just a fab stroke. On a good length just outside off, Samson just stood tall and cracked the back foot punch on the up. Through the covers and it blazed away. What a shot!",Basil Thampi to Samson,FOUR
7130109,RR 1st Inns,3.4,"Basil Thampi to Samson, FOUR, clobbered away! This time, Samson connected the pull perfectly and it raced away. Short of a length around middle, not high enough to threaten the batsman and an in-form batsman like Samson isn't going to miss out. Sends this to the deep square leg fence. Thampi needs to recover quickly",Basil Thampi to Samson,FOUR
7130109,RR 1st Inns,5.3,"S Kaul to Samson, FOUR, such is the form Samson is in, he doesn't need bad balls to score boundaries. Here is another example. A knuckle ball outside off, he just stands tall and uses his supple wrists to drop kick this wide of the long-on fence. The fielder there tried hard but couldn't get to it",S Kaul to Samson,FOUR
7130109,RR 1st Inns,7.5,"Rashid Khan to Rahane, FOUR, 94.8kph, back of the hand stuff, drifting down leg though and generously full. Rahane is quick to pounce on, sits, uses the angle and drills his sweep behind square",Rashid Khan to Rahane,FOUR
7130109,RR 1st Inns,8.3,"Shakib to Rahane, FOUR, a defensive drag down. Rahane stays tall, picks his widely open cow corner. And whips. Splitting the men converging to perfection",Shakib to Rahane,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,1.1,"D Kulkarni to Hales, FOUR, gentle loosener from Kulkarni and Hales duly dispatches it to the fence. Short, wide and plenty of width on offer, Hales reaches out by flailing his hands at that and bashes it through point, who's dive goes in vain. Real warm-up delivery from Kulkarni..",D Kulkarni to Hales,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,1.3,"D Kulkarni to Hales, FOUR, back to shortish length and Hales chooses the mid-wicket region on this occasion. Picked the length extremely early, pivoted back and pulled it firmly in front of square on the leg-side",D Kulkarni to Hales,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,1.5,"D Kulkarni to Dhawan, FOUR, third boundary of the over and you got to feel for the bowler. This full ball swung in late, but how well Dhawan played that. Cleared his front leg in a flash, such quicksilver hands that he flicked it in front of square. The outfield is lighting fast, despite a long chase from the mid-wicket fielder, the ball just about reaches the fence",D Kulkarni to Dhawan,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,11.0,"Lomror to Hales, FOUR, half-tracker and Hales dismisses it from his presence. Ruins a good over from Lomror. Went back in a flash and clouted it brilliantly in the gap between deep mid-wicket and deep square leg",Lomror to Hales,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,11.1,"Unadkat to Williamson, FOUR, Williamson takes the adventure route. Walks across his sticks, waits for the ball to arrive and scooped it over short fine leg. Knew the fine leg was inside the ring and hence opted for the shot",Unadkat to Williamson,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,11.3,"Unadkat to Williamson, FOUR, 14 off first three balls. Unadkat overcompensates and hurls it well outside off. Williamson leant across and spanked it with ferocity over extra cover",Unadkat to Williamson,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,11.5,"Unadkat to Williamson, FOUR, oh, he's taking Unadkat to the cleaners. Streaky this time but Williamson won't mind. Throws his bat on this fuller length delivery outside off and gets a thick outside edge that flies away to the third man fence",Unadkat to Williamson,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,15.0,"Ish Sodhi to Shakib, FOUR, nice way to start for Shakib! Premeditates the paddle sweep and makes a fair amount of connection on it as well. Deflected it really fine down the leg-side and it raced away to the fence",Ish Sodhi to Shakib,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,16.4,"Stokes to Manish Pandey, FOUR, up and over! With mid-off in the ring, perhaps not the ideal length from Stokes and he pays the price for it. Fuller ball and allows Pandey to get under it. Lifted cleanly over the fielder who did leap but was never going to get to it",Stokes to Manish Pandey,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,19.1,"Jofra Archer to Saha, FOUR, lovely shot. Mid-off is up and Archer bowls a fuller length to compound things. Easy for Saha though, he holds his shape and drives beautifully. Splits mid-off and extra cover easily to find the fence. Valuable runs",Jofra Archer to Saha,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,3.1,"D Kulkarni to Williamson, FOUR, Kulkarni has been leaking boundaries. Errs in line again and provides width for Williamson, well outside off. KW just reaches across and slaps it square on the off-side",D Kulkarni to Williamson,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,4.2,"Jofra Archer to Williamson, FOUR, Williamson's special. Classic on-drive. Archer feeds a half-volley on the stumps, Williamson just shifted his weight forward, presented a full face of the bat and drove it neatly past mid-on. No need to run for those as it races away to the fence",Jofra Archer to Williamson,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,6.5,"Ish Sodhi to Williamson, FOUR, rank long hop and Williamson won't spare those. Well outside off, Williamson rocks back, picks his spot and hammers it to the cow corner fence. Threaded the gap beautifully",Ish Sodhi to Williamson,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,9.0,"Ish Sodhi to Williamson, FOUR, excellent from Williamson. Goes inside-out over extra cover. Saw the flighted delivery early, bent low and lifted it effortlessly over extra cover",Ish Sodhi to Williamson,FOUR
7130109,SRH 1st Inns,9.1,"Stokes to Hales, FOUR, back to back fours for SRH. Stokes ushers a short ball at Hales, no venom and he went back to smoke it in the gap between deep square leg and fine leg. Hales having a move on here",Stokes to Hales,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,1.2,"U Yadav to Narine, FOUR, Narine is hurting RCB once again, short of a length and just outside off, Narine rides the bounce and steers it over short third man, no one in the deep and it's a boundary",U Yadav to Narine,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,13.1,"Chahal to Chris Lynn, FOUR, crashes the sweep away behind square. He's doing nothing else, just sweeping. Gets the length he wants and muscles it",Chahal to Chris Lynn,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,16.0,"Murugan Ashwin to Nitish Rana, FOUR, oh poor finish to the spell from Ashwin. Lands the googly outside leg and is punished. Rana grounds his back knee to sweep it over short fine",Murugan Ashwin to Nitish Rana,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,16.2,"Siraj to Nitish Rana, FOUR, Chahal fails to cut it off. He gave it his best, sprinting across and diving from deep backward point but couldn't get a strong enough hand. But how well has Rana timed this yorker. It's very close to the blockhole if not right in it, but Rana slices it superbly through the off-side",Siraj to Nitish Rana,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,17.0,"Siraj to Karthik, FOUR, full in the slot for Karthik who smears it away through extra cover. Excellent finish to the over from the captain. Hammered this drive to the fence",Siraj to Karthik,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,17.1,"Southee to Chris Lynn, FOUR, back-to-back fours. The power of Lynn coming to the fore. Low full toss, not an easy ball to hit but Lynn muscles it straight of long-on",Southee to Chris Lynn,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,17.4,"Southee to Karthik, FOUR, flurry of runs in the last few balls and suddenly KKR are bossing this. Short of length delivery, Karthik beautifully swivels into the pull and helps it into the gap between deep square and fine leg. His timing's on fire",Southee to Karthik,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,19.1,"U Yadav to Shubman Gill, FOUR, that's it. 18-year old Shubman Gill slaps this short ball to the point boundary and swings his bat in celebration. Back-to-back defeats for RCB at the Chinnaswamy",U Yadav to Shubman Gill,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,2.1,"Southee to Narine, FOUR, top-edge and four, another lucky boundary for Narine, banged in short and on the stumps, Narine swivelled across on the pull, gets a fat top-edge that lobs over short fine",Southee to Narine,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,2.2,"Southee to Narine, FOUR, just over mid-on, not RCB's night? Short and at the stumps, Narine backed away on the pull, gets it right off the bottom of the bat, but has enough to clear mid-on for a boundary",Southee to Narine,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,3.1,"Chahal to Chris Lynn, FOUR, lovely shot, tossed up well outside off, Lynn shuffles across, gets well outside off and sweeps it behind square on the on-side for a boundary",Chahal to Chris Lynn,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,4.1,"U Yadav to Chris Lynn, FOUR, low full-toss and that has been drilled through cover, Lynn got his bat down like a sledge hammer and thread the ball through the infield",U Yadav to Chris Lynn,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"Chahal to Chris Lynn, FOUR, cracking shot, tad too full and too wide from Chahal, Lynn backs away and drills it over cover, one bounce and into the fence",Chahal to Chris Lynn,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,6.5,"Siraj to Chris Lynn, FOUR, cracking shot, short and wide of off, Lynn makes room, gets on top of the bounce and clatters it to the right of point, no stopping that",Siraj to Chris Lynn,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,8.4,"Siraj to Uthappa, FOUR, that's poor from the fielder at short fine, too straight from Siraj, on Uthappa's pads and he flicked it fine. Beat Ashwin's awkward dive and rolled away to the fence",Siraj to Uthappa,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,9.2,"Murugan Ashwin to Uthappa, FOUR, beautifully played, overpitched and on Uthappa's pads, he leans forward, gets close to the ball and then plays the on-drive, beat the two fielders in the deep to a nicety",Murugan Ashwin to Uthappa,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,9.3,"Murugan Ashwin to Uthappa, FOUR, this is turning out to be an expensive over from Ashwin, dropped this one short and well outside off, Uthappa waits on it and then reverse laps it past the lone slip",Murugan Ashwin to Uthappa,FOUR
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,9.5,"Murugan Ashwin to Chris Lynn, FOUR, third boundary of the over, slower and shorter of off, Lynn bends down low and places it into the vacant gap at deep mid-wicket, split the two men in the deep to perfection",Murugan Ashwin to Chris Lynn,FOUR
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,1.3,"Narine to de Kock, FOUR, how slow is Uthappa? My word. Took an age to realise where the ball was going and then gave chase, but can only parry it onto the ropes. Wasn't so well-timed but Uthappa picked it up late from the bat and his sprinting ability left a lot to be desired",Narine to de Kock,FOUR
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,1.4,"Narine to de Kock, FOUR, to the left of Uthappa now. No chance for him this time, another sweep, dragged from middle but gets it wide of short fine and it just raced away. de Kock gets going",Narine to de Kock,FOUR
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,11.5,"A Russell to Kohli, FOUR, my word. What a shot. Half-volley outside off, Kohli has dispatched that royally through the covers. No-one moved. But seems to have done some damage to his right-leg after over-stretching on the drive. A limp or two but looks like he will shrug it off",A Russell to Kohli,FOUR
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,13.1,"Johnson to Kohli, FOUR, no problems with the timing there. Picks the slower delivery outside off and then laces the cover-drive on the rise, sheer timing and leaves sweeper cover as a spectator",Johnson to Kohli,FOUR
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,14.1,"Narine to Kohli, FOUR, for a moment when he sliced that, looked like he had holed out, but perfectly placed between deep cover and long-off. Picked the one that goes away, sliced the loft and it is a one bounce over the ropes four",Narine to Kohli,FOUR
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,15.1,"Shivam Mavi to Kohli, FOUR, beautiful touch. Slower ball outside off, Kohli uses the wide gap between backward point and short third to direct the ball there. Shivam Mavi perhaps gave Kohli too much room outside off to play that shot",Shivam Mavi to Kohli,FOUR
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,15.4,"Shivam Mavi to Kohli, FOUR, short and wide outside off, Kohli needs to miss backward point and the sweeper, does so easily, launches it in the air and well wide of both the men, races away",Shivam Mavi to Kohli,FOUR
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,2.3,"Johnson to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, that's Brendon McCullum at his best. Brings the crowd to life. A shimmy down the wicket and then throws his fast hands on the short of length delivery, scythed over extra-cover. Brutal hit",Johnson to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,3.1,"Chawla to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, a shimmy but stays in the crease and slog-sweeps, to the right of deep mid, in the gap and well placed to get a one bounce over the ropes four",Chawla to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,4.4,"Narine to de Kock, FOUR, bit more air, and de Kock sweeps hard, beats mid-wicket on the dive to his left and deep square has no chance. Too full and de Kock found the middle of the bat",Narine to de Kock,FOUR
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,7.3,"Chawla to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, horrible umpiring. Really poor. How is that runs? Brendon McCullum is beaten all ends up by one that squares him up, pitched on middle, turned past the bat and hit the back leg, raced away past DK. Chawla went for a slight appeal and then kept quiet. Llong the ump who has given it as runs. Not even close to the bat. KKR should've reviewed that, but since it was given as runs, they didn't go for it",Chawla to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,7.4,"Chawla to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, short third didn't even move. Nor did backward point. Short and wide outside off, cut right into the gap between the two",Chawla to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,0.2,"Boult to Watson, FOUR, full, swinging in, clipped away, four..That sped away off the bat in a jiffy. Little bit of erring in line and put away",Boult to Watson,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,12.3,"Vijay Shankar to Rayudu, FOUR, connects this time! Clear intent from Rayudu, walks down the track and makes room to loft it inside out over extra cover. Clean strike and it races to the fence on the bounce",Vijay Shankar to Rayudu,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,12.5,"Vijay Shankar to Watson, FOUR, easy pickings! Full toss and a lot of width outside off as well, Watson doesn't even need these gifts in the kind of form that he is in tonight. Absolutely feasts on it with a slice through backward point. Sweeper had no chance",Vijay Shankar to Watson,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,13.0,"Vijay Shankar to Watson, FOUR, more power from Watson! There was a deep cover in place but he was a mere spectator as this blazed to the fence. Fuller ball outside off, juicy enough for Watson to lift it over extra cover. Cracked it away",Vijay Shankar to Watson,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,13.1,"Mishra to Rayudu, FOUR, freebie from Mishra and it's vanished to the fence in no time. Sprayed full and well down leg, Rayudu just had to beat the man at short fine leg and he does so with a hard sweep. All too easy",Mishra to Rayudu,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,16.3,"Boult to Dhoni, FOUR, he is playing around with the field here. Dhoni is on a roll. He is expecting the short ball and swivels to pull this wide of the man at short fine leg. Dhoni is motoring along here. DD need to somehow stop him",Boult to Dhoni,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,16.5,"Boult to Rayudu, FOUR, Rayudu joins in the fun now and Boult is getting a severe beating here. Misses the yorker anmd gives a low full toss, Rayudu is already across the stumps and wrists it away powerfully wide of the long-on fielder. Nicely done",Boult to Rayudu,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,17.2,"Plunkett to Rayudu, FOUR, gets it away very fine. Smart batting from Rayudu but this is equally poor from Plunkett who is having a horror night. Too straight in line on this short ball, Rayudu swivels across to get inside the line and pulls it away. Fine leg was too square",Plunkett to Rayudu,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,18.0,"Plunkett to Rayudu, FOUR, bleeding runs. They have no clue how to bowl to these two at the moment. Plunkett pulls his length back but the width is there outside off, Rayudu just slashes hard at it and gets a slice that beats short third man comfortably to his left. Not exactly where he intended but he won't mind",Plunkett to Rayudu,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,19.4,"Boult to Dhoni, FOUR, blasted away! Doesn't matter where you bowl to him when he is in this mood. Banged in short by Boult and Dhoni was down the track in a flash, flat-batted it powerfully past the Kiwi who did well to get out of the way. Rockets past mid-off who was in the ring. Incredible, simply incredible",Boult to Dhoni,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,2.1,"Boult to du Plessis, FOUR, throws his hands at it and gets a thick edge. The ball flies away to third man and a lazy effort from Avesh Khan at deep third man allows the ball to slip under his hands",Boult to du Plessis,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,2.4,"Boult to Watson, FOUR, gentle from the giant! That was short from round the wicket and the little bit of room was used well by Watson. Just guided the ball between point and short third man for a four",Boult to Watson,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,3.5,"Rahul Tewatia to du Plessis, FOUR, drops it short and that helped the batsman as he was backing away. Drop kicks the ball over the off-side for a four. Much needed for Faf and CSK. Breaking the shackles moment?",Rahul Tewatia to du Plessis,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,6.0,"Avesh Khan to du Plessis, FOUR, short ball at the body. Again skidded through and the batsman under-edges the ball away fine on the on-side for a four. That looked disconcerting for the batsman but he somehow got bat to it and sent it away. Lucky bargain for du Plessis. 56 off the PP!!",Avesh Khan to du Plessis,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,1.1,"KM Asif to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, Shaw goes aerial and clears mid-off. Didn't time it as he would've liked but just enough to clear the fielder. On a back of a length on off, Shaw used his bottom hand to good effect to chip it over the ring. Couple of bounces and home",KM Asif to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,1.3,"KM Asif to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, bosh. In the swinging arc for Shaw and he butchers it straight down the ground. Arrests his high backlift, again employs his bottom hand and bashes it straight down the ground. Watch out ump! Nearly knocked him out there",KM Asif to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,10.3,"Jadeja to Pant, FOUR, Pant falls as he attempts that pull on the short of length ball but he gets enough bat and finds the gap through deep mid-wicket for a boundary",Jadeja to Pant,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,13.4,"Harbhajan to Vijay Shankar, FOUR, poor delivery down the leg-side, Vijay Shankar puts bat to it and guides it wide of the short fine leg fielder for a four. DD needs more of these shots from Vijay Shankar",Harbhajan to Vijay Shankar,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,15.3,"KM Asif to Pant, FOUR, sloppy effort from Rayudu at long-off. Pant doesn't get it anywhere near the middle of the bat but he puts power in the shot as he generally does and ball goes for a four. Pant brings up his fifty with that four",KM Asif to Pant,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,15.5,"KM Asif to Pant, FOUR, Pant goes slightly to the off-side and sweeps it fine of the stumps, ball goes fine of the short fine leg fielder for a four",KM Asif to Pant,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,16.3,"Dwayne Bravo to Pant, FOUR, the line is wrong and Pant is single-handedly threatening CSK here. Slower delivery down the leg-side, can't bowl there with fine leg inside the ring and Pant helps it away on his way over the man at 45",Dwayne Bravo to Pant,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,17.0,"Dwayne Bravo to Pant, FOUR, low full toss and he's mishit this, yet it runs away for four. Long-on was very square and he had no chance of cutting this off",Dwayne Bravo to Pant,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,17.2,"Lungi Ngidi to Pant, FOUR, you are kidding me! What sort of a shot is this? He was almost beaten by the change of pace by this shortish slower ball, slapped it pretty straight towards long-on despite having to fetch this from outside off stump. Dhoni has been having long-on very wide fro Pant and he had no chance. In fact, Dhoni and Bravo were not happy with Faf. Looks like he was standing very wide without instructions and maybe he was just wandering",Lungi Ngidi to Pant,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,2.5,"Lungi Ngidi to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, Ngidi sought to fox Iyer once again but Iyer outfoxes him. Slipped it wider of off on seeing the batsman back away. Iyer throws his bat, reaches out and slaps it with ferocity, beating the packed off-side field",Lungi Ngidi to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,4.0,"Watson to Munro, FOUR, expertly done by Munro. Watson was getting monotonously predictable with his lines. Full and outside off, Munro walked across his sticks and adjusted it beautifully to lift it over mid-on",Watson to Munro,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,4.3,"KM Asif to Munro, FOUR, sledge-hammered over point by the Kiwi marauder. Picked Asif's slower ball early, waited and stayed deep to slash it over point",KM Asif to Munro,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,4.4,"KM Asif to Munro, FOUR, now the overcorrection from Asif, feeds a tasty half-volley. Munro stayed leg-side of the ball, puts his bottom hand to good effect once again to blast it straight down the ground",KM Asif to Munro,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,5.2,"Watson to Pant, FOUR, Watson is not learning. Shifts his line outside off, Pant knew the third man was inside the ring. Scythed it to his right and it zoomed away into the fence. Smartly done",Watson to Pant,FOUR
5715249,DC 1st Inns,8.4,"Jadeja to Maxwell, FOUR, Jadeja errs in line and length, Maxwell makes him pay the penalty. Short, quick and outside off, Maxwell waited and flayed it through cover. Threads the gap and it races away to the fence",Jadeja to Maxwell,FOUR
3981825,MI 1st Inns,10.1,"Krunal Pandya to Kohli, FOUR, that's one of his trademark shots. Saw the full middle stump delivery and then went inside out over cover. No chance for Polly at long-off. Gets forward and then gives himself room to get the elevation",Krunal Pandya to Kohli,FOUR
3981825,MI 1st Inns,11.1,"Markande to Kohli, FOUR, phew! Markande despite getting a boot on that scorching drive, watches the ball run to the fence in a jiffy. Down the track and drilled so so hard",Markande to Kohli,FOUR
3981825,MI 1st Inns,11.5,"Markande to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, poor delivery, too much time for Brendon McCullum on the back foot. Was short and he pummelled the pull between deep square and deep mid. Perfect placement",Markande to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
3981825,MI 1st Inns,12.0,"Markande to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, and again. This time the slog-sweep. Brendon McCullum is playing a blinder now. Kneels down and nails this sweep, leaves deep square and deep mid as spectators",Markande to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
3981825,MI 1st Inns,15.5,"Hardik Pandya to Mandeep, FOUR, one ball per over he will bowl short. Or else he can't bowl. That's Hardik Pandya for you.

3981825,MI 1st Inns,3.1,"Duminy to Vohra, FOUR, that's a good shot. But he looks at his bat. Not entirely happy with the connection. Saw the tossed up delivery and charged Duminy, to the pitch and lofted wide and over mid-on",Duminy to Vohra,FOUR
3981825,MI 1st Inns,3.3,"Duminy to Vohra, FOUR, that's a slog. But he has managed to elude mid-wicket leaping. Dragged the flighted delivery from outside off and even though it came off the thickish inside half, it was enough to beat Rohit",Duminy to Vohra,FOUR
3981825,MI 1st Inns,4.4,"McClenaghan to de Kock, FOUR, this is a thick edge but it will do for de Kock. Backs away and slashes the short of length delivery, gets enough bat on that to clear backward point and short third",McClenaghan to de Kock,FOUR
3981825,MI 1st Inns,6.2,"Markande to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, no third man. Nor there is short third. Easy shot for Brendon McCullum. He reverse-swats the length ball turning away from him wide of backward point",Markande to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
3981825,MI 1st Inns,9.4,"Hardik Pandya to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, slower delivery outside off, Brendon McCullum flat-bat thrashes that, didn't hit it really sweetly, but enough to beat long-off running to his left.

2353730,DC 1st Inns,10.2,"Unadkat to Pant, FOUR, that's almost gone all the way! Pant lost his balance on this shot, which isn't unusual as we know but this is still outrageous to pull off. Swivels across on the pull and skies it in the air down the leg-side. Too fine though and the fine leg fielder could only watch it land in front of the ropes and brisk away",Unadkat to Pant,FOUR
2353730,DC 1st Inns,11.4,"Gowtham to Pant, FOUR, these two are targeting Gowtham and this is the big push DD needed. Too short in length and Pant won't miss out on these. Swivels back and nails the pull. Well to the right of deep mid-wicket",Gowtham to Pant,FOUR
2353730,DC 1st Inns,11.5,"Gowtham to Pant, FOUR, incredible stroke! As if his conventional strokes aren't working enough, Pant brings out the reverse sweep. Connects comfortably to clear short third man. Bleeding runs now",Gowtham to Pant,FOUR
2353730,DC 1st Inns,12.5,"D Kulkarni to Pant, FOUR, this was hit so hard that the ball vanished to the fence in no time. Pant is expecting the wide yorker now and sets himself up for it.

2353730,DC 1st Inns,13.0,"D Kulkarni to Pant, FOUR, nearly took short extra cover's hand along with it! How hard is Pant hitting the ball! Gee, insane stuff! Half volley with a lot of width and it's absolutely crashed through extra cover. The fielder there got a hand on it and yet, it flew away to the fence. Pant is continuing exactly from where he left off in Pune the other night",D Kulkarni to Pant,FOUR
2353730,DC 1st Inns,13.2,"Stokes to Pant, FOUR, the man at sweeper cover is of no use when Pant hits the ball like this. Can perhaps just help retrieve the ball from the fence. Full and quite wide outside off, Pant bludgeons this through the covers. Nobody moved at all",Stokes to Pant,FOUR
2353730,DC 1st Inns,15.4,"Jofra Archer to Vijay Shankar, FOUR, gets it away very fine. Not exactly where he intended but Shankar will take this. Short of a length outside off, he went hard on the cut and got a big slice that flew away to the third man fence",Jofra Archer to Vijay Shankar,FOUR
2353730,DC 1st Inns,16.1,"Unadkat to Vijay Shankar, FOUR, poor bowling and Shankar pounces on it. Too straight in line from round the wicket and all that the batsman has to do it get it over short fine leg. Does so with a lofted stroke after a walk across the sticks",Unadkat to Vijay Shankar,FOUR
2353730,DC 1st Inns,2.5,"D Kulkarni to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, slapped away!! Four between cover and mid-off. Stays leg-side of the ball, the room was there and the batsman lets his hands to whirlwind the ball away. Prithvi Shaw is handing out some pasting to Kulkarni",D Kulkarni to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2353730,DC 1st Inns,3.2,"Gowtham to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, little backing away movement supplemented with fine hands. The ball threads into the gap on the off-side and the ball races away into the cover fence",Gowtham to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR

2353730,DC 1st Inns,4.4,"Unadkat to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, length ball, Shaw stays back and punches uppishly off the back foot. Bit of a slice, which is why he isn't in control, and interestingly gets it over the man at mid-on who was running back.

2353730,DC 1st Inns,4.5,"Unadkat to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, check and four! The slower delivery and the batsman just checked his punch to ensure he lent enough power on the shot. The ball raced away to the fence teasing Gowtham, the man at mid-off, till the very end",Unadkat to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2353730,DC 1st Inns,9.0,"Stokes to Pant, FOUR, short ball again but slower at 120ks. This time punished. He waited on it and muscled the ball over mid-wicket for a four. He was not over committed into the stroke and that helped him",Stokes to Pant,FOUR
2353730,DC 1st Inns,9.3,"Jofra Archer to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, sliced away nicely! Iyer has been backing away to the shorter length ball and does it again. This time he gets a fair chunk of the outer half and flies well wide of the third man fielder to his right",Jofra Archer to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR

2353730,RR 1st Inns,11.5,"Boult to Gowtham, FOUR, It is a four, and it's been dropped in the deep by the captain, can you believe it! Crazy scenes here at the Kotla. This is going down to the last ball, it was on a fuller length and at the stumps, Gowtham flaunts his hitting prowess and hits the ball over long-on, timing wasn't great and Iyer at long-on spills it. Right through his hands there. Couldn't close the palms, the ball rips through it and bounces once before tagging the boundary ropes. Maxwell is around too, standing close-in and watching everything. Tries to slap the rebound off the ground into the playing area but fails to get a hand. Four! Six needed off the last ball!",Boult to Gowtham,FOUR
2353730,RR 1st Inns,2.5,"Avesh Khan to Buttler, FOUR, Avesh Khan is under pressure and he bowls a poor delivery, ball was outside off, Buttler makes full use of the room and scythes it through backward point for a boundary",Avesh Khan to Buttler,FOUR
2353730,RR 1st Inns,3.4,"Plunkett to Buttler, FOUR, Pant was flying in air like David De Gea, he gets a hand on it but fails to grab the catch.

2353730,RR 1st Inns,5.2,"Avesh Khan to Buttler, FOUR, young man is under pressure. It was another full toss and Buttler with this form is not going to miss out. He connects well and places it well through fine leg for a single",Avesh Khan to Buttler,FOUR
2353730,RR 1st Inns,8.4,"Boult to D Arcy Short, FOUR, intention was to hit it over deep mid-wicket into the stands, gets an inside edge and ends up hitting it wide of the short fine leg fielder for a four",Boult to D Arcy Short,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,0.3,"Johnson to Watson, FOUR, oh, gosh. How did Watson manage to get this wide of mid-off. Lost timing totally as he went chasing for a drive to an outswinger slanted outside off. Way too early into the shot and canned it off the inner half, evades mid-off who refuses it put in a dive. All the way and Watson is off the mark with a boundary",Johnson to Watson,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,0.5,"Johnson to du Plessis, FOUR, edged and past the lone slip. Goodish length, moving away outside off. du Plessis threw his bat hard at it, ends up feathering a thick outside edge which flew past Uthappa at widish first slip. The third man had no chance as it sped away to the fence in a hurry",Johnson to du Plessis,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,1.3,"Chawla to du Plessis, FOUR, poor poor effort from Uthappa. What an error from the vice captain of KKR. Flat and quick outside off, du Plessis punches it from the crease towards Uthappa at cover-point, who clumsily lets it through. Chawla is not happy with the effort",Chawla to du Plessis,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,1.5,"Chawla to du Plessis, FOUR, tossed up teasingly outside off and du Plessis says thank you very much. Leans across, picks it up and lifts it disdainfully over mid-off. Clean swing of the bat!",Chawla to du Plessis,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,10.5,"Narine to Rayudu, FOUR, brilliant placement from Rayudu. Safe bet against Narine. Tossed up on middle and leg, Rayudu sank low and gets under it to sweep it in the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket",Narine to Rayudu,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,12.2,"Johnson to Rayudu, FOUR, edged and profitable result for Rayudu. Johnson wears a wry smile on his face. Slanted across outside off, lured Rayudu into playing a false shot. Gets the outside edge and unfortunately for Johnson, it flew past a diving DK to his right",Johnson to Rayudu,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,13.2,"Chawla to Rayudu, FOUR, poor line by Chawla. Can't bowl such freebies to a batsman in such fine form. Down the leg side and Rayudu sweeps it away to the fine leg fence. Fielder is nowhere close to cut this down",Chawla to Rayudu,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,19.3,"Chawla to Jadeja, FOUR, 50-run stand up with that blow. Was the googly around off, Jadeja walked down the wicket and slammed it right past the bowler and the umpire who had to take evasive action",Chawla to Jadeja,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,19.4,"Chawla to Jadeja, byes, FOUR, CSK will take that! Doesn't matter how they come.

6347542,CSK 1st Inns,2.4,"Shivam Mavi to du Plessis, FOUR, ah, time for French cricket from du Plessis. Late swing for Mavi again, du Plessis squirts an inside edge that almost shaved the leg-stump. Fine leg was inside the circle and it escapes away to the fence",Shivam Mavi to du Plessis,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,20.0,"Chawla to Dhoni, FOUR, Dhoni finishes off in style, with a boundary. Picks the length early on the short one, rocks back and pulls it right into the gap at deep mid-wicket. No fielder there as CSK end on a competetive score",Chawla to Dhoni,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,3.5,"Narine to Watson, FOUR, no half measures from Watson on this occasion. Spots the half-tracker early, chooses his spot and muscles it to the right of deep mid-wicket fielder. One-bounce four",Narine to Watson,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,4.2,"Johnson to Watson, FOUR, oh goodness! What a strike from Watson. Johnson and the umpire had to take evasive action as it was struck so hard. Can you believe it? Still runs away to the fence. Full and on off, Watson stomps forward and hammers it back at Johnson, who puts up his left hand to take cover. The ball hits him and flies away past a ducking umpire Abhijit Deshmukh to the boundary. That must've hurt and it's his bowling arm",Johnson to Watson,FOUR

6347542,CSK 1st Inns,6.3,"A Russell to Raina, FOUR, woah. How cleverly did Raina place that? Deft hands. Played it so late, just used Russell's pace, waited deep and glided it to the third man fence. Wonderful from Raina!",A Russell to Raina,FOUR
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,7.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Watson, FOUR, very smart from Watson. Knew there was no fine leg; plants his front leg across and rolls his wrists on the sweep. Sends it very fine and earns himself a boundary",Kuldeep Yadav to Watson,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,12.0,"Harbhajan to Karthik, FOUR, good shot to get off the mark. Hint of width on this short of length and that's enough for Karthik. He is quick to trek back and employ the cut shot behind square. Finds the gap and fetches his first boundary",Harbhajan to Karthik,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,12.3,"Dwayne Bravo to Shubman Gill, FOUR, top shot! Bravo overpitches with mid-off inside the circle. Gill stays leg-side of the ball and thumps it over wide mid-off. One bounce and into the fence",Dwayne Bravo to Shubman Gill,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,13.4,"Karn Sharma to Karthik, FOUR, moves leg-side evn before the ball is delivered does Karthik and that would have distracted the bowler.

6347542,KKR 1st Inns,15.2,"Jadeja to Shubman Gill, FOUR, that's delicious. More air on this ball from Jadeja, Gill reaches out with a stride and gets to the pitch of the ball. Follows it up with a superb drive through extra cover",Jadeja to Shubman Gill,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,15.5,"Jadeja to Karthik, FOUR, now DK tries the reverse sweep and manages to get some bat on it. Off the inside part, misses the batsman's pad and beats the short third man fielder too. The asking rate is below 6",Jadeja to Karthik,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,16.1,"Lungi Ngidi to Karthik, FOUR, all too easy. Ngidi doles out a short ball down leg and Karthik just helps it on its way. Pulled away to fine leg for another boundary",Lungi Ngidi to Karthik,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,17.1,"Dwayne Bravo to Karthik, FOUR, bowls a low full toss on the pads from round the wicket. A hit-me delivery. Flicked away very fine. Watson doesn't bother to put a dive. Why would you do that, when you already know the result",Dwayne Bravo to Karthik,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,17.3,"Dwayne Bravo to Karthik, FOUR, Karthik is just toying with the bowler. Well, Bravo hasn't been on target as well. Full toss on the pads, Karthik walks forward and flicks it over the square leg umpire's head",Dwayne Bravo to Karthik,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,17.4,"Dwayne Bravo to Karthik, FOUR, Karthik hits the winning runs. Slower ball wide of off, Karthik throws his bat at it and slices it wide of backward point, who put in the dive. Runs away to the fence and that's it. KKR win by 6 wickets!",Dwayne Bravo to Karthik,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,2.2,"Lungi Ngidi to Narine, FOUR, edged away! Full length delivery around middle and leg, Narine takes on the bowler, swings hard and gets an outside edge that flies over the slip cordon to find the fence. Every boundary Narine hits from here on will hurt Jadeja",Lungi Ngidi to Narine,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Lungi Ngidi to Narine, FOUR, pulled away! He'll continue playing the same way, doesn't matter. Short length around around off, Narine clears his front leg again and pulls it over mid-wicket, beats the man in the deep with ease",Lungi Ngidi to Narine,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,3.0,"Lungi Ngidi to Uthappa, FOUR, how quick is this outfield! Or is the timing by Uthappa? Fullish on the pads and Uthappa nicely flicks it through mid-wicket. Beats short mid-wicket and deep mid-wicket with his perfect timing on this flick",Lungi Ngidi to Uthappa,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,4.0,"Watson to Narine, FOUR, another edge, another boundary! Was a full length delivery angled away from the batsman, Narine went hard at it, swung at it and got a thick outside edge that flew over gully this time. Hit out or get out, this is the only one way Narine knows",Watson to Narine,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,4.3,"KM Asif to Narine, FOUR, Harbhajan Singh misfields! This is contagious. First Jadeja, now Bhajji. MS Dhoni would be livid with this. Was a full length delivery outside off, Narine went for a drive and got an outside edge towards third man where a misfield helped him with a boundary. Narine will be thanking CSK fielders for their generosity tonight",KM Asif to Narine,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,5.2,"Watson to Shubman Gill, FOUR, how well has Gill played that? This was a short delivery and dipping into him. Gill adjusts well and pulls it nicely, beats deep square leg by some distance and gets off the mark",Watson to Shubman Gill,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"Watson to Shubman Gill, FOUR, that's called improvisation. Picks the length early again, goes back in his crease and guides this towards the third man fence. Opened the face of the bat real late and got a cheeky boundary",Watson to Shubman Gill,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,6.0,"Watson to Shubman Gill, FOUR, that was in the air, but in the gap too. Ends the powerplay with a boundary, does Gill. Was short and wide outside off and Gill placed his square cut right into the gap between point and cover-point. End of a fruitful powerplay for KKR",Watson to Shubman Gill,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,7.1,"Harbhajan to Rinku Singh, FOUR, what a way to greet a new bowler. Looped up delivery, but in the process overpitched, Rinku presses forward and chipped it inside-out over extra cover. Top shot",Harbhajan to Rinku Singh,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,9.1,"Harbhajan to Rinku Singh, FOUR, nicely done! Risky, but executed it so well. With a slip in place, Rinku employs the late-dab. Played very late and got it wide of the slip fielder. No third man to stop that",Harbhajan to Rinku Singh,FOUR
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,9.5,"Harbhajan to Shubman Gill, FOUR, that's an incredible shot. Was a full ball and Gill doesn't get down to sweep. Can't call it as sweep. A half-sweep, half-whip. Powerfully hit through square leg. Raced away",Harbhajan to Shubman Gill,FOUR
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,10.5,"Duminy to Gayle, FOUR, similar delivery but the field is slightly tinkered to Gayle. Sweeper cover was brought in and extra cover was moved back. Gayle knew it, so went deep and flashed it in the pocket between cover and backward point",Duminy to Gayle,FOUR
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,13.3,"Cutting to Nair, FOUR, some fortune for Nair. Walked across and tried to slog it across the line. Gets a thick top-edge and it flies away to the third man fence. The fielder was inside the ring and had no chance",Cutting to Nair,FOUR
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,19.2,"Hardik Pandya to Stoinis, FOUR, Stoinis is playing a blinder for Punjab. Sees a short ball, backs away and bludgeons it powerfully wide of long-on. Evades the fielder comfortably",Hardik Pandya to Stoinis,FOUR
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,20.0,"Hardik Pandya to Stoinis, FOUR, wow! This has been a morale-boosting over for Punjab. Banged short, at the stumps. Stoinis is too strong to miss out. Pulls it witheringly to the cow corner fence",Hardik Pandya to Stoinis,FOUR
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,3.4,"Hardik Pandya to Gayle, FOUR, Gayle breaks free and this is his first attacking shot of the night, fraction too full and just outside off, Gayle gets his left leg out of the way, brings his bat down and thumps it back past the non-striker, one bounce and over the ropes",Hardik Pandya to Gayle,FOUR
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,3.5,"Hardik Pandya to Gayle, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Gayle, fraction too short and wide of off, Gayle backs away, gets his left leg out of the way and clatters it to the left of point, no stopping that",Hardik Pandya to Gayle,FOUR
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,4.0,"Hardik Pandya to Gayle, FOUR, three boundaries off the over and 16 came from it, too short and too wide from Hardik, can't bowl those lengths with third man in the ring, Gayle backs away and clears the fielder with the cut, one bounce and over the ropes",Hardik Pandya to Gayle,FOUR
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,5.3,"McClenaghan to Gayle, FOUR, Gayle has got going now, predictable delivery from McClenaghan, full and just outside off, Gayle gets forward and thumps it over mid-off, one bounce and over the ropes",McClenaghan to Gayle,FOUR
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,6.2,"Markande to Rahul, FOUR, nicely played by Rahul, too full and on the stumps, Rahul gets forward, doesn't bend down completely and plays a half-arm sweep past mid-wicket, bisects the two men in the deep to a nicety",Markande to Rahul,FOUR
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,8.5,"Markande to Gayle, FOUR, this is excellent cricket, the wrong 'un from Markande, pitched well outside off and spun away, Gayle waited for the ball to do its bit, arched back and carved it over backward point, the fielder gave the chase, but the ball spun away past him and into the fence",Markande to Gayle,FOUR
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,9.4,"Hardik Pandya to Gayle, leg byes, FOUR, sloppy from Ishan Kishan once again, low full-toss on Gayle's pads, he was looking to flick and missed, went fine and to the right of the keeper. Kishan was late on the dive and lets the ball slip through for four leg-byes",Hardik Pandya to Gayle,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,11.1,"Stoinis to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, lovely stroke. Stoinis erred by gifting a low full toss on the pads, Suryakumar with that flourish of his wristed it away through square leg. Rajpoot was stationed well behind square and made a desperate attempt to get to the ball. In vain",Stoinis to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,12.3,"Mujeeb to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, clubbed wide of long-on. It was in the air but Hardik got his placement right. On a good length from a flat trajectory, he gets under it and flays it away",Mujeeb to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,13.3,"Andrew Tye to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, Stoinis lets it through! Poor fielding and his Aussie teammate who is bowling won't be amused at all. Slower and fuller outside off, Hardik absolutely belted the drive but it shopuld have been cut off at sweeper cover. Instead it sneaks through Stoinis and crashes into the fence",Andrew Tye to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,15.4,"Andrew Tye to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, good placement and timing to get Krunal off the mark. Finds the fence. Fuller ball on the pads, he shuffled across and flicked this well wide of the deep mid-wicket fielder who had lot of ground to cover",Andrew Tye to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,17.2,"Stoinis to Rohit, FOUR, sublime stroke! Most people would have tried slogging this but not Rohit. Uses his timing and placement to find the fence. Full and wide outside off, unfurls the drive with finesse past a diving extra cover fielder. There wasn't any protection in the deep",Stoinis to Rohit,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,17.4,"Stoinis to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, an exact replica from Krunal and the runs are coming now. Full and wide outside off, slower ball but the width allows the southpaw to free his arms. Crashes it through extra cover and the man at sweeper is very wide",Stoinis to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,17.5,"Stoinis to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, raining boundaries now! This is the over MI needed to turn this game around and Stoinis is bearing the brunt of it. Misses the yorker for the second time in as many deliveries and it's a full toss on the pads, easily chipped away aerially but well wide of short fine leg",Stoinis to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,18.2,"Andrew Tye to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, not where he wanted to hit this but who cares? MI are cantering now. Slower and shortish, foxed Krunal for a moment but the length allowed him to adjust. Lobbed wide of backward point and it races away. Just 11 off 10 needed now!",Andrew Tye to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,19.0,"Andrew Tye to Krunal Pandya, leg byes, FOUR, Mumbai are alive! They live on to fight another day this season. An anti-climax of a finish, slow yorker and Krunal missed the slog to be hit on the back leg. KXIP were busy appealing for LBW and the ball raced away to the fence. They didn't have any review to challenge the call anyway and so it meant that the game was settled",Andrew Tye to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,3.4,"Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, that's been smuggled past Ashwin at mid-on. Slower ball yeah, and Suryakumar Yadav clips it safely wide of Ashwin there. Knew the chase, as lethargic as it'll be, will be more for the cameras. And it was..",Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,4.1,"Andrew Tye to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, so starts with a slower delivery that decks away and ironically allows Suryakumar Yadav the room to slap it off the back foot. Through extra cover",Andrew Tye to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,7.1,"Axar to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, perfect length for Suryakumar Yadav. Not too full, not too short, so he could kneel and half-pull half-sweep that through fine leg",Axar to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,8.1,"Stoinis to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, overpitched slower one and that's been burnt down to long-on. Absolutely drilled away with little respect",Stoinis to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
3529537,MI 1st Inns,9.4,"Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, more runs! Just the momentum MI were needing after a lull phase. Rajpoot errs on the shorter side and there is width as well, Suryakumar holds his shape and slaps the cut behind point. Fifty for SKY",Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,0.1,"Southee to Watson, FOUR, cracking shot! That is not the place to bowl to any batsman. Short, wide and outside off, just the delivery Watson would have liked to get him going, slapped the cut square on the off-side and opened his account in style",Southee to Watson,FOUR
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,0.4,"Southee to Watson, FOUR, even with a sweeper Watson collects a boundary. Southee is still searching for swing, pitches it up and Watson leans forward to caress the drive through cover. de Grandhomme gave up the chase early",Southee to Watson,FOUR
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,10.3,"de Grandhomme to Rayudu, FOUR, poor ball from de Grandhomme, short and angling into Rayudu's pads, he swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side for a boundary",de Grandhomme to Rayudu,FOUR
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,15.5,"Murugan Ashwin to Dhoni, FOUR, poor ball from Ashwin, drops his length short and well outside off, Dhoni is all over it like a rash, slaps it past cover and collects his first boundary",Murugan Ashwin to Dhoni,FOUR
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,5.3,"Southee to Rayudu, FOUR, slower delivery and Rayudu spotted that early, a much needed boundary for CSK that. Waited for the off-cutter, stood his ground and heaved it over mid-wicket. No chance for AB to pull it back in",Southee to Rayudu,FOUR
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,6.0,"Southee to Rayudu, FOUR, big over for CSK, 16 off it. Overpitched delivery and right in the slot for Rayudu, with the form he is, there is no missing out on such freebies, drills the drive wide of mid-off. Did Kohli err in giving Southee a third?",Southee to Rayudu,FOUR
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,7.2,"Chahal to Raina, FOUR, poor delivery from Chahal. Rank long hop and Raina had all the time in world to pick his spot, transfers his weight on the back foot and slots the pull past square leg, no chance for the man in the deep",Chahal to Raina,FOUR
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,8.1,"U Yadav to Raina, FOUR, easy! That is well played by Raina. Short of length delivery, Raina shuffled across to get inside the line, picked it up from the middle stump line and tickled it fine. Runs starting to flow quite comfortably now",U Yadav to Raina,FOUR
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,1.0,"Willey to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, that's been so brilliantly placed. Short of length but it's just outside off, so escapes the ignominy of being a short-wide ball and adds to the genius of Brendon McCullum, who's nicely used his hands to glide it right between short third man and backward point",Willey to Brendon McCullum,FOUR
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,1.4,"Lungi Ngidi to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, that's over mid-on. And comfortably. Seam-up back of a length ball that allows Parthiv Patel a cross-batted swat. Not right out of the middle but the shot thrust meant that it cleared the fielder",Lungi Ngidi to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,1.5,"Lungi Ngidi to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, fuller and this has been deliciously chipped over mid-wicket. All timing. No show.",Lungi Ngidi to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,12.0,"Harbhajan to de Grandhomme, FOUR, finds the fence! Much-needed one for RCB to break the shackles. de Grandhomme gets into the act. Used his feet to get to the pitch and what he did well was to go straight down the ground. Cannot afford to play across the line on this pitch and he does the smart thing. Hit it dead straight and Shardul from long-on did try to get to the ball but eventually missed it",Harbhajan to de Grandhomme,FOUR
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,16.4,"Willey to Southee, FOUR, lucky runs but RCB will take them any way they come. Low full toss that Southee wanted to slug away on the leg-side. Gets an inside edge that just whizzes past leg stump. Too fine and short fine leg had no chance",Willey to Southee,FOUR
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,17.1,"Dwayne Bravo to Southee, FOUR, first ball for Bravo and he has been punished. Fuller ball outside off, Southee unfurls a cracking drive through extra cover. Finds the fence, 100 up for RCB finally",Dwayne Bravo to Southee,FOUR
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,18.3,"SN Thakur to Southee, FOUR, this is a very vital cameo from Southee, infusing respectability into the RCB innings. Funny shot though, walked across the sticks for the paddle scoop and instead skied it towards third man. Very fine and Ngidi tried to get to it, even got a hand on it but could only palm it to the ropes. Dropped!",SN Thakur to Southee,FOUR
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,4.2,"SN Thakur to Kohli, FOUR, gee that's disrespectful. Transfers the weight on the front foot and flat-bats it over Thakur's head",SN Thakur to Kohli,FOUR
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,6.0,"Lungi Ngidi to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, and he makes me eat crow with a dismantling cover drive. Actually not even that. Far from it. A bit of room on this fuller length delivery and he's slapped it through covers. Threw his hands at it and somehow made it look like the prettiest thing you'll see today",Lungi Ngidi to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,7.1,"Harbhajan to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, sliding on off-stump from round the wicket, and Parthiv Patel's greeted him with a reverse-sweep that he deftly places wide of the lone slipper",Harbhajan to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,9.1,"Harbhajan to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, top shot! Not much gap between backward point and short third man but Parthiv has found it. To begin with, there wasn't any width on offer as Harbhajan darted this around off, the southpaw still managed to get the cut away. Bhajji is not amused",Harbhajan to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4811184,DC 1st Inns,1.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, crunched away! Short and wide outside off, Shaw throws his hands at it and crunches it through the gap at cover-point, races away to the fence in a jiffy. How good has he looked in his maiden IPL season!",Sandeep Sharma to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4811184,DC 1st Inns,14.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, a rare blip from Shikhar Dhawan in the field, you won't see this often because he's usually a good fielder. A dipping low full toss on off, Iyer smashes it down to long-off, Dhawan was pretty squarer and had to run across to his right. Did so and in the process, sort of took his eyes off the ball. Or got an awkward bounce too, failed to get his body behind the line of the ball and lets it through to the fence",Sandeep Sharma to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
4811184,DC 1st Inns,16.0,"S Kaul to Pant, FOUR, a welcome boundary for Pant, this should get him going. Kaul wafts it full outside off, Pant plonks his front foot forward and blasts it straight back at Kaul, who sticks his hand out but can't cling onto it. Brushes his fingertips and trickles away to the straight boundary. Umpire Bruce Oxenford had to take cover as it was coming at him",S Kaul to Pant,FOUR
4811184,DC 1st Inns,19.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Vijay Shankar, FOUR, Shankar picks the leg-cutter on this occasion. Took a stride forward, opened his bat face and flayed it past point. Sweeper cover fielder couldn't get across and it runs away to the boundary",Bhuvneshwar to Vijay Shankar,FOUR
4811184,DC 1st Inns,4.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, boundary to end the over. Short one on the pads and all Shaw has to do is help it on its way. Does so and drags it past the fielder at short fine leg, finds the fence and moves on to 28* with that, was the knuckle ball and Shaw picked it up nicely",Sandeep Sharma to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4811184,DC 1st Inns,4.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, straight down the ground! Another slower delivery on a full length on middle, Iyer stays put and drives it straight back, almost takes down Shaw at the other end who takes evasive action and loses balance. Can't keep a fielder there as Iyer scores his first boundary",Bhuvneshwar to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
4811184,DC 1st Inns,5.4,"S Kaul to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, pulled away! He's looking to make the most of the powerplay. This was a short delivery around off, Shaw picked the length early and pulled it nicely over mid-wicket",S Kaul to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4811184,DC 1st Inns,5.5,"S Kaul to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, Kaul is feeling the pressure. Struggling with his lines and lengths. Has tried the knuckle ball, the short one but nothing's going his way. This was on the pads and Shaw dragged it down to fine leg with ease",S Kaul to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4811184,DC 1st Inns,6.0,"S Kaul to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, 20 runs off that Kaul over! Think this is Kaul's most expensive over of IPL 2018. Coming back to the ball it was a shortish one outside off, Shaw transfered his weight on to the back foot and crunched it through the gap at cover, two fielders went for the chase but none could stop that",S Kaul to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4811184,DC 1st Inns,7.3,"Rashid Khan to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, doesn't even spare Rashid Khan. Short one, probably the googly, Shaw camps back and pulls it well past the fielder at deep square leg",Rashid Khan to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4811184,DC 1st Inns,8.4,"Shakib to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, that's a perfect example of a square cut. Was another short delivery outside off and Iyer was on to it in a flash. Rocks back and chops it right into the gap between point and cover-point",Shakib to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,1.1,"Avesh Khan to Hales, FOUR, lousy beginning from Avesh. Whangs in a short ball on leg-stump line, forgets the fine leg is inside the circle. Easy picking for Hales, swivels across and helps it over the man at 45. Didn't get it off the middle but enough to clear the fielder",Avesh Khan to Hales,FOUR
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,1.3,"Avesh Khan to Hales, FOUR, Hales is aware of the field. Perhaps realised another short ball was coming. Moved away to the leg-side, opened himself up and ramps it over short third man",Avesh Khan to Hales,FOUR
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,14.5,"Christian to Manish Pandey, FOUR, two fielders run across, see each other and neither go for the ball. Comical. Two overseas fielders - Roy and Boult. Was a low full toss and Pandey got underneath it to bunt it over the bowler's head. Long-on should have cut that off. Ordinary stuff!",Christian to Manish Pandey,FOUR
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,15.0,"Christian to Manish Pandey, FOUR, now these two boundaries have made a mess of Christian's figures. The length was shortened by Christian, Pandey danced out of his crease and slapped it through covers. In the gap and 13 came off that over",Christian to Manish Pandey,FOUR
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,18.3,"Boult to Y Pathan, FOUR, gold! Boult misses his mark. Doles out a wide-ish full ball and Pathan reaches out with hard hands. Sliced through backward point and that's gone for a boundary",Boult to Y Pathan,FOUR
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,19.3,"Christian to Y Pathan, FOUR, just 2 needed now! Has to be SRH's game from here. Pacy bouncer and Pathan goes for the pull. Off the top-edge and goes over the man at short fine leg",Christian to Y Pathan,FOUR
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,4.2,"Plunkett to Hales, FOUR, overcorrects and lands a fuller length delivery on the pads. Hales shuffled a bit and that must've put Plunkett off-guard. Moves inside the line and glances it very fine. The fielder was inside the ring and didn't have any chance",Plunkett to Hales,FOUR
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,5.0,"Plunkett to Dhawan, FOUR, Plunkett is spraying it all over the place. Misses the line and ends up offering a buffet ball for Dhawan down leg. Just needed to get some bat on that. Does so after a half-swivel and runs it down to the fine leg fence",Plunkett to Dhawan,FOUR
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,8.4,"Mishra to Dhawan, FOUR, that's a gift and Dhawan takes full toll of it. What was that from Mishra? Darts a full toss on the pads and Dhawan won't miss out on those. Bends his back leg and clouts it behind square leg. There's none to stop that",Mishra to Dhawan,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,1.4,"Bumrah to Chris Lynn, FOUR, edged and four, a second slip would have swallowed it, back of a length and in that channel outside off, Lynn pushed at that tamely, got a thick edge that flew past the lone slip",Bumrah to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,1.5,"Bumrah to Chris Lynn, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Lynn and he's away, the slower ball from Bumrah, it was a back of a length delivery as well, Lynn spotted it early, got on top of the bounce and punched it through cover. Krunal Pandya gave the chase, but the ball sped away to the ropes",Bumrah to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,11.2,"Cutting to Uthappa, FOUR, that's good anticipation. Knew Cutting will be slow and around off, so shuffles across on his knees and swept this through fine leg. Nicely done",Cutting to Uthappa,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,11.3,"Cutting to Uthappa, FOUR, another slower delivery. Not much to guess out there for Uthappa at the moment. Stays put and flashes the late cut in front of the backward point fielder. 79 off 51 needed",Cutting to Uthappa,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,11.4,"Cutting to Uthappa, FOUR, first fifty of the season for Uthappa. He's making a day out of Markande's drop. Another short ball, Uthappa stays front-footed and heaves that over mid-wicket. Gloriously weird shot",Cutting to Uthappa,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,11.5,"Cutting to Uthappa, FOUR, short and into his right shoulder, and here's what Uthappa does: Swivels and pulls it through fine leg. Life's ridiculously easy at times",Cutting to Uthappa,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,15.5,"Markande to A Russell, FOUR, that wasn't too short but look at Russell pin all his weight on the back foot, and deep in the crease, and swat it disparagingly wide of long-on.

2957424,KKR 1st Inns,17.0,"Bumrah to Karthik, leg byes, FOUR, given as leg byes. Goes for the slower delivery but gets the radar wrong. Slipping down leg; beats the batsman and then the keeper too. 43 needed off 3 overs!",Bumrah to Karthik,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,17.4,"Hardik Pandya to Karthik, FOUR, good follow-up with the slower delivery but got the length wrong. And the line. Shortish outside off, allowing Karthik to stay back and flash it square on the off-side",Hardik Pandya to Karthik,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,18.5,"Bumrah to Karthik, FOUR, misses the yorker by inches and that's good enough for DK. Went back and got under it, drilling it uppishly through a very straight long-on",Bumrah to Karthik,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,19.0,"Bumrah to Karthik, FOUR, Duminy drops it at deep square and then also lets it go for a boundary. Low full toss, Karthik got into a position early and swiveled the hack round the corner. It was right upto Duminy, who went for the reverse cup but lets it through. What's worse: it bounces once before the boundary ropes. Bad. Very bad",Bumrah to Karthik,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,19.1,"Krunal Pandya to Narine, FOUR, gee this is going south. Krunal has done nothing to allay fears. Bowls a full toss and is hammered down the ground. 19 off 5 needed",Krunal Pandya to Narine,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,19.4,"Krunal Pandya to Karthik, FOUR, wide full toss and Karthik's carved it over the infield square on the off-side",Krunal Pandya to Karthik,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,2.0,"Bumrah to Chris Lynn, byes, FOUR, a hat-trick of boundaries ruins the over, lovely ball from Bumrah, cut back in sharply from a length outside off, Lynn was caught on the back-foot as he wafted, got beaten on the inside edge and the ball further swung away, leaving Ishan Kishan stranded",Bumrah to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,2.1,"McClenaghan to Shubman Gill, FOUR, KKR are dealing in boundaries at the moment, tad too full and wide of off, Gill gets forward, closed the face of the bat and drives it in between the non-striker and the umpire, no need to run for those",McClenaghan to Shubman Gill,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"McClenaghan to Chris Lynn, FOUR, this is turning out to be a fine start for KKR, too short and on the stumps, Lynn swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side, beat short fine and rolled away to the fence",McClenaghan to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,2.4,"McClenaghan to Chris Lynn, FOUR, cracking shot, this short-ball plan isn't working for MI, too short and just outside off, Lynn swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it in front of square on the on-side, the man in the deep is too square and has no chance",McClenaghan to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,3.4,"Hardik Pandya to Nitish Rana, FOUR, lovely, too full and too wide of off, allows Rana to free his arms as he scythes it past cover-point, off the mark with a boundary",Hardik Pandya to Nitish Rana,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,6.5,"Krunal Pandya to Nitish Rana, FOUR, cracking shot, the quicker ball from Krunal, but the length was short and wide of off, Rana backs away and beats the man at point with a fierce cut",Krunal Pandya to Nitish Rana,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,7.1,"Markande to Nitish Rana, FOUR, nicely played! Rana is looking a million dollars today, tossed up well outside off, Rana picked the length early, bent down low, rolled his wrists and swept it behind square on the on-side, beat the diving fielder in the deep",Markande to Nitish Rana,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,9.0,"Krunal Pandya to Uthappa, FOUR, a gift and Uthappa accepts it with glee, full-toss outside off, all Uthappa had to do was to find the gap, he gets forward and drills it to the right of extra-cover, no chance for the fielder getting across from long-off",Krunal Pandya to Uthappa,FOUR
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,9.5,"Cutting to Uthappa, FOUR, a gift and Uthappa will not miss out. Cutting lost his line as he attempted another slower ball, ends up drifting down the leg-side and all Uthappa had to do was to whip it into the gap - he does so, behind square on the on-side and MI continue to bleed boundaries",Cutting to Uthappa,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,1.2,"Prasidh to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, 134.3kph, short and wide outside off, Suryakumar Yadav spots the length quickly, gets on top of the bounce and cuts through point. Perfectly placed between backward point and cover-point. First boundary of the match",Prasidh to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,10.2,"Chawla to Rohit, FOUR, fabulous shot! Wee bit of space offered from Chawla on this flighted delivery and that is enough for Rohit to put it away, strides forward and creams the drive through cover. The timing ensures that sweeper is also beaten",Chawla to Rohit,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,12.1,"Chawla to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, dropped! Narine got fingertips to it. Floated up around off, Yadav stayed leg-side to play the inside out loft, didn't get the elevation he was looking for and Narine parried it over him. A more agile fielder might have taken it",Chawla to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,14.3,"A Russell to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, the elder Pandya has made his intentions clear. Anything there to be hit, he's going for it. Short and slanted across off, Pandya transfers his weight back and pulls it over mid-wicket. No protection in the deep there",A Russell to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,15.5,"Prasidh to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, slapped! In trying to shorten the length Krishna offers width outside off, Pandya stands tall and cracks the cut square on the off-side, raced away quickly beating sweeper cover",Prasidh to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,16.0,"Prasidh to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, the last two deliveries ruins the over for Krishna and KKR. Superb batting though from Pandya. Shuffled across and paddled the back of a length delivery over and wide of short fine leg. Just used the pace of the bowler",Prasidh to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,19.3,"Prasidh to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, streaky! This is a cruel game. Krishna deceived the batsman with a good slower delivery, Pandya was through the shot and the outside edge bisects Karthik and short third man perfectly",Prasidh to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,19.4,"Prasidh to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, if he is going to bowl the wide yorker, then third man needs to be back. Yes, it was a bottom edge but the bowler and captain need to be smart, Pandya reached out with a bent back knee and squirted it off the toe-end to the fence",Prasidh to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,2.3,"Johnson to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, over-corrects by overpitching outside off. Suryakumar Yadav won't miss those. Leans into the drive and caresses it through covers. Raced away",Johnson to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,2.5,"Johnson to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, there's the width and there's the slash to follow that. Bullets away. The length was perfect to be hit. Shortish and angling away, Suryakumar Yadav stands tall and cuts it fiercely through backward point",Johnson to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,3.5,"Narine to Lewis, FOUR, didn't time it well, but manages to fetch a boundary. This was bowled fuller and Lewis went hard on the drive. He probably wanted to go through mid-off and got it off the inside edge. Beats mid-on by a long way and once it beat him, the quick outfield did the rest",Narine to Lewis,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,4.0,"Narine to Lewis, FOUR, nothing wrong on this occasion from Lewis. Saw the length on the shorter side, quickly rocked back and cut it ferociously beating the cover fielder to his left",Narine to Lewis,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,5.2,"Chawla to Lewis, FOUR, four more! It was the googly from Chawla, not sure if Lewis picked it. He went through with his lofted drive and slices it off the outside half. Over the cover region and that dribbles away over the bouindary rope",Chawla to Lewis,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,5.3,"Chawla to Lewis, FOUR, got to feel for the bowler. Bamboozled Lewis with another googly and Lewis was caught in his crease looking to block. Takes the outside edge and races away to the third man fence",Chawla to Lewis,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,7.2,"Nitish Rana to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, that's a terrific shot! Wristy shot. Fired on leg and Suryakumar Yadav had his back leg off-air while he made contact. Whipped powerfully and finds the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket. Raced away",Nitish Rana to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,7.4,"Nitish Rana to Lewis, FOUR, how did that go for a boundary. Rana saw the batsman back away and fired a yorker, Lewis brings his bat down a touch late and manages to get a toe-end on it. Luckily for the batter, misses the stumps and runs away to third man for another boundary",Nitish Rana to Lewis,FOUR
2957424,MI 1st Inns,8.0,"Nitish Rana to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, 16 runs off the over! Another glorious shot. Bottom hand power.

2957424,MI 1st Inns,9.0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, wow! That was superbly played. Wasn't a bad ball from Kuldeep Yadav. A good length ball on off, Suryakumar Yadav went deep in his crease and that allowed him to free his arms. Plays the back-cut perfectly to beat a diving backward point fielder to his left. Third man was inside the circle as well",Kuldeep Yadav to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,1.5,"Jofra Archer to Gayle, FOUR, Gayle wants to show who is the boss here. He backs away, goes on the top of the bounce and punches it though cover for a four",Jofra Archer to Gayle,FOUR
7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,14.2,"Unadkat to Stoinis, FOUR, just past a flying Buttler to his right! Excellent bowling from Unadkat, totally bamboozled Stoinis with this off cutter and induced a thick edge on the drive. Buttler did all he could with a dive to his right but couldn't reach it. Raced away fine to the third man fence",Unadkat to Stoinis,FOUR
7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,16.2,"Jofra Archer to Stoinis, FOUR, slammed away! Archer just misses his yorker and ends up dishing out a low full toss. Width on offer too and this is crashed past a diving extra cover. Sweeper cover ain't stopping this",Jofra Archer to Stoinis,FOUR
7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,17.4,"Unadkat to Rahul, FOUR, more runs! Unadkat is being taken to the cleaners here. Came round the wicket and actually got his line right but Rahul is in such a mood that he will put even the good ones away. Makes room by backing away and steers it to find the gap. Bisects short third man and backward point with ease",Unadkat to Rahul,FOUR
7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,18.4,"Jofra Archer to Rahul, FOUR, fittingly a Rahul signature cover drive to finish the game. He's been fantastic tonight and has calmly ensured an easy win for KXIP. Overcooked from Archer and it's been creamed away off the front foot. Long-off had no chance of cutting it off. KXIP return to winning ways",Jofra Archer to Rahul,FOUR

7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,3.1,"Jofra Archer to Gayle, FOUR, brute power! Fuller in length from Jofra Archer this time, Gayle clears his front leg and absolutely smashes it wide of the mid-off fielder for a four",Jofra Archer to Gayle,FOUR
7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,5.0,"Stokes to Nair, FOUR, throws his bat at a wide one and sends a thick edge wide of Rahane at second slip. Good effort from Shreyas Gopal at third man to cover a lot of ground to his left, but he fumbled a touch while on the dive and it runs away for a boundary",Stokes to Nair,FOUR
7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,6.2,"Stokes to Nair, FOUR, terrific shot, Nair portrays his class. It was a fuller length ball at the stumps, Nair brings his bat down gun-barrel straight and drives it straight down the ground for a four",Stokes to Nair,FOUR
7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,7.2,"Shreyas Gopal to Rahul, FOUR, touch short and Rahul makes full use of it. He goes deep in the crease and pulls it to the deep mid-wicket fence for a four",Shreyas Gopal to Rahul,FOUR
7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,9.0,"Anureet Singh to Rahul, FOUR, that shot had class written all over it. He waited and waited for the ball to come and just opens the bat face at the last moment, timing was perfect and so was placement. Ball beats the short third man fielder for a four",Anureet Singh to Rahul,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,0.4,"Ashwin to Buttler, FOUR, that's easy for Buttler! Bowls short and outside off, Buttler lets his lovely hands take over. Crisply punched through covers. CYA LATER",Ashwin to Buttler,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,1.2,"Rajpoot to Buttler, FOUR, Buttler is such a dangerous player at the top and this is why? Gets a short ball outside off, he half-swivels and pulls nonchalantly over mid-wicket. No-one there",Rajpoot to Buttler,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,1.4,"Rajpoot to Buttler, byes, FOUR, unlucky for the bowler but Buttler and RR won't mind. Shuffled miles across his off-stump to try the funky paddle-scoop over the keeper, but Rajpoot sprayed it too far outside off to foil his plans, result? It flies past the helpless keeper",Rajpoot to Buttler,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,1.5,"Rajpoot to Buttler, FOUR, short and wide, Buttler lashes that behind point. Gee, he's hit that with some power. Third man ain't getting there",Rajpoot to Buttler,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,11.5,"Ashwin to Stokes, FOUR, sweet sound on that cracking shot by Stokes. This was pushed through outside off by Ashwin and Stokes was quick to camp back and slam it to the right of long-off. Beats the man chasing it with utter ease",Ashwin to Stokes,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,12.2,"Mujeeb to Stokes, FOUR, is it Stokes' night? Looking at the way he's played so far, definitely looks like. This was a flat delivery and full in length outside off, Stokes went for the reverse sweep and got it right past the fielder at short third man",Mujeeb to Stokes,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,13.0,"Mujeeb to Buttler, FOUR, successive fifties for Buttler. Moving up the order is certainly doing wonders for him. Short and wide outside off, Buttler camps back and cuts it through the gap at cover point",Mujeeb to Buttler,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,15.1,"Rajpoot to Gowtham, FOUR, misfield by Mujeeb results in a boundary. Rajpoot isn't pleased one bit with the effort and has his hands on his hips. This was a short and wide delivery that was cut to square third man by Gowtham. Mujeeb guarding that region lets it through and gifts four runs to the opposition",Rajpoot to Gowtham,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,16.0,"Rajpoot to R Tripathi, FOUR, won't be able to stop this though. Short again and outside off, Tripathi makes the most of the provided width and cuts it in the same direction once again. Mujeeb sprints to his right but the ball is too quick for him",Rajpoot to R Tripathi,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,18.0,"Andrew Tye to Shreyas Gopal, FOUR, that shot was all about timing. How quickly it ran away to the fence, quite surprising. A low full toss on leg and Gopal times his on-drive. Mayank at long-on tried hard to cut this down but couldn't stop the boundary",Andrew Tye to Shreyas Gopal,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,18.3,"Rajpoot to Shreyas Gopal, FOUR, these are useful runs for Royals. They'll take it and Gopal is playing a sweet little cameo here. A full length delivery outside off and the batsman slices it over point and gets a boundary",Rajpoot to Shreyas Gopal,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,18.4,"Rajpoot to Shreyas Gopal, FOUR, four more! Drags the length back and bowls a slower one outside off, Gopal goes after it with hard hands and gets an outside edge. Eludes the man at short third man and gets back-to-back boundaries",Rajpoot to Shreyas Gopal,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,2.0,"Rajpoot to Buttler, FOUR, not again! Another short delivery in Buttler's arc, he transfers his weight onto the back foot and smashes the hell out of that leather over mid-wicket",Rajpoot to Buttler,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,2.4,"Mujeeb to Buttler, FOUR, Buttler is pouncing on anything short. He opens up his stance slightly to give himself enough leverage on the off-side, jumps back and clatters it past extra cover",Mujeeb to Buttler,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,6.5,"Ashwin to Samson, FOUR, dished wide of off-stump, Samson frees his arms and clobbers it past backward point",Ashwin to Samson,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,7.1,"Axar to Samson, FOUR, half-volley outside off, Samson's back lift is so high that it allows him to cream those drives through extra cover. Advantage Samson when you bowl full. Timed and placed to perfection...",Axar to Samson,FOUR
7442279,RR 1st Inns,9.0,"Andrew Tye to Buttler, FOUR, more than 80 percent of Buttler's runs have come off short deliveries so far. KXIP aren't learning. To make matters worse, Tye sprays it down leg and all Buttler needed to do was help it on its way. Karun Nair dives, but all of that sliding effort goes in vain",Andrew Tye to Buttler,FOUR
9002051,RCB 1st Inns,1.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, beautiful shot! The inswinger from Bhuvneshwar but it's a touch too straight. Parthiv flicks it elegantly through in front of square on the leg-side and beats the fielder in the ring. Races away",Bhuvneshwar to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
9002051,RCB 1st Inns,1.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, finds the gap this time. Just past a diving mid-on to his right.

9002051,RCB 1st Inns,10.1,"Rashid Khan to Moeen Ali, FOUR, flashes at this googly turning away from him and the edge zooms over slip. Dhawan barely had any time to get his hands up",Rashid Khan to Moeen Ali,FOUR
9002051,RCB 1st Inns,11.1,"S Kaul to Moeen Ali, FOUR, two boundaries for Moeen so far, one off the outside edge and this one off the inside. Almost chopped it back onto off-stump. Back of length outside off, loosely wafts at it with cemented feet and gets lucky",S Kaul to Moeen Ali,FOUR
9002051,RCB 1st Inns,15.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Mandeep, FOUR, oh this is not good from Siddarth Kaul. A good over is spoiled as he lets the ball slip through his hands at the boundary. Back of length, Mandeep drags his pull through mid-wicket wide of the deep fielder. Should still have only been two at most. But Kaul couldn't get a hand on it while tumbling to his left",Sandeep Sharma to Mandeep,FOUR
9002051,RCB 1st Inns,17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to de Grandhomme, FOUR, good yorker from Bhuvneshwar, but he has to watch in agony as de Grandhomme's toe-edge runs away past short third man",Bhuvneshwar to de Grandhomme,FOUR
9002051,RCB 1st Inns,2.3,"Shakib to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, nails this one. Parthiv is keen to take Shakib on. Sees it floated up into the left-hander and launches the slog-sweep over mid-wicket. Clean strike",Shakib to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
9002051,RCB 1st Inns,2.4,"Shakib to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, hammered away. Parthiv is on a roll here. Baffling though to see KW hand the ball to a left-arm spinner in the Powerplay with the ball not really turning. Fuller ball around middle and leg, lofted cleanly over mid-on and it races away to the fence",Shakib to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
9002051,RCB 1st Inns,3.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Kohli, FOUR, the signature Virat Kohli cover drive! Short cover got a hand on it, mid-off tried to get to his left and put in a slide but it beat them both en route to the fence.

9002051,RCB 1st Inns,4.3,"Shakib to Kohli, FOUR, mowed away over mid-wicket. Kohli has had enough of plodding around. Sees this arm ball on a good length and clobbers it over mid-wicket. Easily over the infield",Shakib to Kohli,FOUR
9002051,RCB 1st Inns,4.5,"Shakib to Kohli, FOUR, got it finer than he intended to but he won't mind. Flatter and closer to off, executes the late cut and it dribbles away off the outer half. Beats short third man easily and speeds to the fence",Shakib to Kohli,FOUR
9002051,RCB 1st Inns,5.1,"S Kaul to Kohli, FOUR, new bowler but the strategy from Kohli continues to be the same - attack! Charges down the track early and plays his favorite pick-up stroke over mid-wicket. Rashid in the deep had a bit of ground to cover and tried hard but in vain. The RCB skipper is pumped up, that's for sure",S Kaul to Kohli,FOUR
9002051,RCB 1st Inns,8.2,"Rashid Khan to Kohli, FOUR, goes through KW's hands at first slip! Is this the game for SRH? Massive moment in the game. Kohli plays this leg break off the back foot and ends up edging it straight to his opposition counterpart. Williamson didn't expect it to come so quickly perhaps and it went through him to the fence",Rashid Khan to Kohli,FOUR
9002051,SRH 1st Inns,1.4,"U Yadav to Dhawan, FOUR, picks the slower delivery and pulls wide of mid-wicket. On the front foot too, with the weight going forward, hit the gap perfectly and it raced away",U Yadav to Dhawan,FOUR
9002051,SRH 1st Inns,10.2,"Chahal to Williamson, FOUR, poor delivery to follow. Very short, Williamson had all the time to rock back and pull. Chooses his area and gets it wide of CdG at deep square. Should've dived but didn't",Chahal to Williamson,FOUR
9002051,SRH 1st Inns,11.1,"de Grandhomme to Shakib, FOUR, CdG comes on and serves up a short and wide delivery outside off, again Shakib shows off his cutting skills.

9002051,SRH 1st Inns,16.2,"Siraj to Shakib, FOUR, backward square is in and Shakib splits him and short fine leg, with a heave. Length ball on off, thick inside edge is enough to go into the gap",Siraj to Shakib,FOUR
9002051,SRH 1st Inns,16.4,"Siraj to Shakib, FOUR, brilliant improvisation. Takes it from middle and scoops wide of short fine. Nothing wrong from Siraj who attempted the yorker, didn't nail it and it was the cleverness of Shakib that outwitted him there",Siraj to Shakib,FOUR
9002051,SRH 1st Inns,17.4,"Southee to Y Pathan, FOUR, Pathan knows what is coming. Gets inside the line to this short of length delivery, pulls over and wide of short fine, races away. Southee became to predictable there. Needs to bowl the yorker",Southee to Y Pathan,FOUR
9002051,SRH 1st Inns,17.5,"Southee to Y Pathan, FOUR, no he doesn't. A slower ball short bouncer, at the head of Pathan, who hooks and gets it fine of Parthiv Patel, no chance for him. Successive fours and poor from Southee",Southee to Y Pathan,FOUR
9002051,SRH 1st Inns,2.0,"U Yadav to Hales, FOUR, full on off, Hales goes through with the loft and even though he didn't get it off the middle of the bat had enough power to clear the fielder at mid-off.

9002051,SRH 1st Inns,2.4,"Southee to Williamson, FOUR, easy for Williamson. He is a class player. A gift from Southee, down leg, with fine leg inside the circle, a beautiful leg-glance and Williamson is off the mark with four",Southee to Williamson,FOUR
9002051,SRH 1st Inns,4.3,"Southee to Williamson, FOUR, Southee got that wrong. Tried something different with the slower delivery, floated it up full and wide outside off, Williamson crashed the drive wide of mid-off. Left everyone motionless.

9002051,SRH 1st Inns,9.2,"Moeen Ali to Shakib, FOUR, that's a good cut. Dangerous but Shakib plays late and takes it from off, delays the shot to get it wide of the diving Umesh at short third. Much needed boundary for SRH",Moeen Ali to Shakib,FOUR

9414123,KXIP 1st Inns,13.2,"Anureet Singh to Axar, FOUR, heaved away. That kinda slower delivery that gives away its cards early because it's been pitched on a length. Axar delays his cross-batted mow and picks a boundary through wide long-on. Uppish and safe",Anureet Singh to Axar,FOUR
9414123,KXIP 1st Inns,14.0,"Anureet Singh to Rahul, FOUR, leg cutter and Rahul's smashed him off the front foot. Shortish, decking away, and hammered through mid-wicket with utter disadain. Another day at work, another fifty for Rahul",Anureet Singh to Rahul,FOUR

Bowled the slower one that spins away, Rahul looked ungainly while chipping this, because he was aiming cow corner. Just manages to clear mid-off, and there's Unadkat in the deep, sliding with the ball into the ropes..",Jofra Archer to Rahul,FOUR
9414123,KXIP 1st Inns,18.5,"Jofra Archer to Rahul, FOUR, oh that's another stunner from Rahul. Shuffled across and timed his pick-up scoop just right. Not easy if that's almost a yorker from Jofra Archer. Perhaps an inch short but how good was Rahul, laying into it like it's a right he's earned",Jofra Archer to Rahul,FOUR
9414123,KXIP 1st Inns,19.0,"Jofra Archer to Rahul, FOUR, this boundary means that 32 is required off the last over. Rahul gets into the scoop position again, and ramps this up over short fine leg",Jofra Archer to Rahul,FOUR
9414123,KXIP 1st Inns,19.5,"Unadkat to Rahul, FOUR, now he's opened his stance completely here. Chest facing the bowler as he reverses this over short third man",Unadkat to Rahul,FOUR
9414123,KXIP 1st Inns,20.0,"Unadkat to Rahul, FOUR, another similar open-chested reverse-hack over short third man but unfortunately, it's not enough for KXIP. Rajasthan Royals win by 15 runs",Unadkat to Rahul,FOUR
9414123,KXIP 1st Inns,5.1,"Stokes to Rahul, FOUR, Rahul latches on anything loose, he absolutely does. It was a fuller length delivery outside off, Rahul reaches for it and slams the drive over point",Stokes to Rahul,FOUR
9414123,KXIP 1st Inns,5.5,"Stokes to Rahul, FOUR, treat to watch! Good length delivery outside off, Rahul gets into good position and drives it sumptuously through cover, raced away all along the carpet",Stokes to Rahul,FOUR
9414123,KXIP 1st Inns,7.4,"Lomror to Akshdeep Nath, FOUR, excellent shot from Akshdeep Nath. This will give him some confidence. He comes down the track and at the same time makes room for himself to loft it over deep cover for a handsome boundary",Lomror to Akshdeep Nath,FOUR
9414123,KXIP 1st Inns,9.1,"Lomror to Rahul, FOUR, touch short, Rahul picks up the length quickly, goes deep in the crease and pulls it through deep mid-wicket for a four",Lomror to Rahul,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,0.3,"Stoinis to Buttler, FOUR, 135.7kph. Strays. Feeds the pads, trying out the surprise inswinger after the set up with a couple of away ones, gets it wrong and Buttler is quick to whip, neatly behind square",Stoinis to Buttler,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,0.4,"Stoinis to Buttler, FOUR, oh the punch. Walks down, gets behind the line, on top of the good length, and straight bats, down the ground",Stoinis to Buttler,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,1.4,"Axar to Buttler, FOUR, gets the width, makes it look worse moving away and inside-outs it over extra cover. Ah, the delight of watching him open",Axar to Buttler,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,10.4,"Axar to Buttler, FOUR, very, very poor effort from Tye. Too lazy to bend down and Axar is not happy at all. Slashed wide of long-off, Tye moves across to his left, went with one-hand pretty late and ends up letting it roll away to the fence",Axar to Buttler,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,13.5,"Ashwin to Samson, FOUR, 50-stand comes up between the duo. Overdoes the carrom ball. Short, wide and width for the taking, Samson accepts it with glee and slaps it past cover-point. No sweeper cover and it'll be a boundary",Ashwin to Samson,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,15.1,"Ashwin to Stokes, FOUR, biceps and triceps. Wrists and fists from Stokes. Gets into business by backing away to leg and hammers it over the bowler's head. So powerful! Picked the safest spot in the ground as well",Ashwin to Stokes,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,19.4,"Andrew Tye to Lomror, FOUR, oh, this will do for the Royals. Finally, Lomror gets some bat. Goes low and scoops this full ball at the stumps over short fine leg",Andrew Tye to Lomror,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,2.1,"Mohit Sharma to Buttler, FOUR, 134.6kph. Warms up with a rather innocuous back of a length sitter. Buttler doesn't need any further warming up though. He stays up tall, rocking back and flat-bats. Hard. Crunched through mid-wicket",Mohit Sharma to Buttler,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,2.5,"Mohit Sharma to Rahane, FOUR, third man isn't there. Rahane has a measure of it, and holds his cut back. Waits, lets it get close and chops it to pierce slip and short third, to perfection",Mohit Sharma to Rahane,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,4.2,"Mohit Sharma to Buttler, FOUR, 134.1kph. So damn deft. A seam up outside off, and Buttler, lines himself up, opening his bat face very late, just to guide it through the cordon. The empty cordon",Mohit Sharma to Buttler,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,5.2,"Andrew Tye to Buttler, FOUR, overcooked on the legs. And Buttler owns him, all bottom-hand in this whippy on-drive. He knows there's no long-on, and he bisects the ones inside the ring to perfection",Andrew Tye to Buttler,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,5.3,"Andrew Tye to Buttler, FOUR, further dismissive. Tye overcorrects his line, goes outside off, but the length remains just as friendly. Matters taken over the covers now, leg-bent, hands flowing and creaming it one-bounced",Andrew Tye to Buttler,FOUR
9414123,RR 1st Inns,9.4,"Mujeeb to Buttler, FOUR, sprays it down leg. Buttler's quick to latch on, swivelling, swiping flat and hammering it fine",Mujeeb to Buttler,FOUR
5886474,KKR 1st Inns,0.1,"McClenaghan to Narine, FOUR, just over. For a second Narine would have had his heart in his mouth. The full length delivery from McClenaghan, Narine stays leg-side and toe-ends the loft over Rohit at mid-off. He was standing well inside the circle. Had he been on the edge, he would have gobbled that up",McClenaghan to Narine,FOUR
5886474,KKR 1st Inns,0.4,"McClenaghan to Chris Lynn, FOUR, streaky! But Lynn won't mind it. He's off the mark with a boundary. The idea from McClenaghan is to push it across the right-hander, Lynn throws everything at the drive and the outside edge runs away fine",McClenaghan to Chris Lynn,FOUR
5886474,KKR 1st Inns,0.5,"McClenaghan to Chris Lynn, FOUR, now on the other side of the ground. McClenaghan needs to stick to one plan. Short and on leg-stump, Lynn didn't go hard on the pull, just relied on placing it fine and pocketing a boundary",McClenaghan to Chris Lynn,FOUR
5886474,KKR 1st Inns,10.0,"Hardik Pandya to Tom Curran, FOUR, streaky! Once again Curran plays down the wrong line. He wanted to punch the back of a length delivery and got an inside edge, the ball flies over the stumps and goes away to the fine leg fence",Hardik Pandya to Tom Curran,FOUR

5886474,KKR 1st Inns,16.0,"Markande to Tom Curran, FOUR, he's done well to make the contact he's made. Floated up very wide, Curran reaches out and belts the flat-batted drive wide of long-off",Markande to Tom Curran,FOUR
5886474,KKR 1st Inns,2.4,"McClenaghan to Chris Lynn, FOUR, McClenaghan has lost the plot a bit against Lynn. Goes short and at the body, no pace this time and Lynn is able to pick his spot, swivels around and places the pull backward of square. All along the ground",McClenaghan to Chris Lynn,FOUR
5886474,KKR 1st Inns,5.1,"Hardik Pandya to Nitish Rana, FOUR, nice way to start the over. Rana gets a leg-stump half volley and he puts it away nonchalantly, leans forward and flicks it backward of square leg, fine leg was inside the ring and the man in the deep was square",Hardik Pandya to Nitish Rana,FOUR
5886474,KKR 1st Inns,5.3,"Hardik Pandya to Nitish Rana, FOUR, bisected Ishan Kishan and wide slip to perfection. The off-cutter from Pandya and Rana read it early, waited back in his crease, opened the bat face and glided it right between the two fielders",Hardik Pandya to Nitish Rana,FOUR
5886474,KKR 1st Inns,9.0,"Markande to Karthik, FOUR, smacked! Karthik needs to get on with the game. Tossed up on off and middle, Karthik bents his back knee and powers the sweep in front of square, splitting deep backward square and deep mid-wicket",Markande to Karthik,FOUR
5886474,MI 1st Inns,0.4,"A Russell to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, he's in sublime touch and couldn't have got off with a better shot.

Was timed well and raced away to the fence in no time.",A Russell to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5886474,MI 1st Inns,10.1,"Chawla to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, Ishan Kishan is going to play his shots. Premeditated and makes good contact. A powerful reverse-sweep and strikes cleanly. Got it over short third man and there is no one to stop that",Chawla to Ishan Kishan,FOUR

5886474,MI 1st Inns,11.0,"Chawla to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, in the air, in the gap and that's Ishan Kishan's third boundary in this over.

5886474,MI 1st Inns,12.0,"A Russell to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, glorious shot! Full and outside off, was probably overpitched and Ishan Kishan pounced on it. Crouches low, reaches out and powerfully cracks it through extra cover. Raced away",A Russell to Ishan Kishan,FOUR

5886474,MI 1st Inns,12.4,"Prasidh to Rohit, FOUR, miscued pull and the lightning quick outfield ensures that it is a boundary. Got to feel for the bowler. Bowled two good balls and both have gone for fours. Banged it short and got good lift, cramped Rohit for room. Rohit, despite not being in a good position, went for the pull. Got decent wood and more importantly it went in the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on",Prasidh to Rohit,FOUR
5886474,MI 1st Inns,13.0,"Prasidh to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, nothing wrong about this shot. Picked the short ball got early, gets into a strong position shuffling across and elevates it over backward square leg with his front foot off air. Pulled away!",Prasidh to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
5886474,MI 1st Inns,19.3,"Chawla to Cutting, FOUR, now a four. Another fast-paced delivery, Cutting swings hard and makes good contact. Goes into the cow corner fence",Chawla to Cutting,FOUR
5886474,MI 1st Inns,2.2,"Tom Curran to Lewis, FOUR, cracking shot! Sweet sound on that blow. Full length delivery outside off, Lewis doesn't miss out and crunches this one through the gap at cover. Was in the air for a while but no fielder was anywhere near",Tom Curran to Lewis,FOUR
5886474,MI 1st Inns,2.4,"Tom Curran to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, ahh, the form he is in! Lovely shot by Surya there.

Gets it past the man at wide slip to find the third man fence",Tom Curran to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5886474,MI 1st Inns,4.0,"Narine to Lewis, FOUR, beats Russell's sprint. Another example of how quick this outfield is. Even the fastest runner in KKR couldn't reach anywhere close to this. Was a short delivery outside off, Lewis was quick to rock back and crack it to the wide of long-off. That boundary will spoil Narine's over",Narine to Lewis,FOUR
5886474,MI 1st Inns,4.4,"Prasidh to Lewis, FOUR, wasn't middled. Pitched up on a full length outside off, Lewis shuffles a bit and gives it all. Throws his bat at it and gets the outside edge beat the man at third man. No chance of stopping that",Prasidh to Lewis,FOUR
5886474,MI 1st Inns,5.1,"Chawla to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, what a poor delivery to start off. Gifts a juicy full toss on middle and leg, Yadav gets down on his knee and sweeps it over square leg",Chawla to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5886474,MI 1st Inns,5.2,"Chawla to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, this was even better. A full and tossed up delivery around off, Yadav strides forward and lofts it to perfection over extra-cover. His confidence is high and that shot will make him feel even better",Chawla to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5886474,MI 1st Inns,7.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, the boundaries from Suryakumar continue to flow. On the pads and the batsman does well to get down and sweep it sweetly to the fine leg fence",Kuldeep Yadav to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR

4254114,DC 1st Inns,10.4,"S Kaul to Pant, FOUR, another poor delivery. He's struggling with his lines and lengths tonight.

4254114,DC 1st Inns,12.0,"Rashid Khan to Pant, FOUR, that's the third boundary of the over. Pant is showing no mercy against Rashid.

4254114,DC 1st Inns,17.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, FOUR, amazing shot that. Was a length ball outside off, Pant does well to ramp this over short third man. The ball is just flying all over the place, to all the corners. Awestruck by this display of batsmanship!",Bhuvneshwar to Pant,FOUR
4254114,DC 1st Inns,18.2,"S Kaul to Pant, FOUR, that's Pant's maiden century in the IPL. Has missed out on a few occasions previously but doesn't miss out tonight.

4254114,DC 1st Inns,2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Roy, FOUR, smart batting! Roy has sussed the pitch and decides to go straight with his aggressive shots. Pays off instantly. A touch fuller from Bhuvneshwar and it's been launched straight over the bowler's head",Bhuvneshwar to Roy,FOUR
4254114,DC 1st Inns,3.3,"Shakib to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, excellent footwork from Shaw! This wasn't all that full but he came down the track in a flash and lofted it over Shakib's head. Mid-on was a mere spectator. Top stroke! Not a bad ball at all, just a top shot",Shakib to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4254114,DC 1st Inns,5.1,"S Kaul to Pant, FOUR, that's a typical Pant stroke! Back of a length and a bit of width on offer. He throws his hands to slam it on the up and finds the gap at cover as well. Raced away in a flash",S Kaul to Pant,FOUR

4254114,SRH 1st Inns,10.5,"Mishra to Dhawan, FOUR, now Dhawan was almost hoodwinked in the air. Mishra saw him charging down and bowled it slow down leg. But Dhawan was upto it. Would have been stumped otherwise. Gets some bat and deflects it wide of the keeper",Mishra to Dhawan,FOUR
4254114,SRH 1st Inns,11.3,"Harshal Patel to Dhawan, FOUR, he's read this slower ball! gosh he has. Slow and short, Dhawan stays on the front foot as he mauls this over deep mid-wicket.

4254114,SRH 1st Inns,14.1,"Boult to Williamson, FOUR, is welcomed to the crease with a boundary. Kiwi to Kiwi and Williamson greets him with a flick of his wrists to the fence and brings up his fifty as well. Superbly constructed knock from the SRH skipper, waves his bat to the dug-out. His 6th half-century of the season. It was too leg-sidish from Boult, Williamson moved across and wristed it nonchalantly through square leg. In the gap!",Boult to Williamson,FOUR

4254114,SRH 1st Inns,5.0,"Plunkett to Williamson, FOUR, Harshal at square third man can't get to it.

8725921,CSK 1st Inns,11.2,"Jofra Archer to Watson, FOUR, edged but safe! So unlucky for the bowler. Bowls a pacy short delivery around off, Watson goes hard at it with a pull but a thick top edge eludes the keeper to find the fence",Jofra Archer to Watson,FOUR

8725921,CSK 1st Inns,2.3,"Jofra Archer to Raina, FOUR, Raina makes the most of the free-hit. Archer is not impressed. Very full and outside off, Raina bends down and uses the pace of the bowler to squeeze it behind point. No chance for third man to cut that off",Jofra Archer to Raina,FOUR

8725921,RR 1st Inns,16.3,"Willey to Buttler, FOUR, oh well well. Where is sweeper cover? The fielder was very square in his position, and Buttler made some room to slap the ball away from off-stump.

5002114,KKR 1st Inns,14.2,"Axar to Karthik, FOUR, swept from in front of off-stump and Tye's lazy at the deep square leg ropes. Doesn't bend down enough as he picks it one-handed",Axar to Karthik,FOUR

7242907,SRH 1st Inns,14.2,"Willey to Williamson, FOUR, 100-run stand comes up between the duo. Cross-seamer from Willey, but it's too full outside off. Can't bowl there with mid-off in the circle. Williamson leans forward and drills it over the fielder's head beautifully",Willey to Williamson,FOUR
7242907,SRH 1st Inns,14.4,"Willey to Dhawan, FOUR, swings south does Dhawan. But the ball goes in the direction of north. He won't mind though as long as boundaries are coming.

7242907,SRH 1st Inns,14.5,"Willey to Dhawan, FOUR, stand and dismiss stuff from Dhawan. Just admires the shot, knew the moment he connected it was a boundary.

7242907,SRH 1st Inns,2.4,"Willey to Dhawan, FOUR, that'll give him some confidence. Length delivery on middle, Dhawan stands tall and pummels this one over mid-wicket, that's a fine shot by the southpaw",Willey to Dhawan,FOUR
7242907,SRH 1st Inns,2.5,"Willey to Dhawan, FOUR, this one is even better. Full length ball outside off, Dhawan reaches for it and slaps it through the gap at extra-cover. The fielders on the off side had hardly any time to react",Willey to Dhawan,FOUR

9236293,MI 1st Inns,14.0,"D Kulkarni to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, cheeky! He plays this shot quite a lot, does Pandya. Banged in and the line being outside off allowed Pandya to periscope the ramp to the third man fence. Got it fine enough to beat the fielder",D Kulkarni to Hardik Pandya,FOUR

9236293,MI 1st Inns,4.1,"Stokes to Lewis, FOUR, short, nothing in terms of pace, everything in terms of width. And Lewis makes it worse with him backing away, throws his hands out, gets a fat edge. And a vacant cordon is enough",Stokes to Lewis,FOUR
9236293,MI 1st Inns,5.3,"D Kulkarni to Lewis, FOUR, 118.3kph. Those hands, those adjusting hands. It holds up for much longer, Lewis almost commits into his slap early, but all of sudden can hold it, let the ball get close and guide it to point's left. Now ..",D Kulkarni to Lewis,FOUR
9236293,MI 1st Inns,6.0,"D Kulkarni to Lewis, FOUR, full toss number five. And for a change Lewis can put it away. Swings a little too hard, mistimes his swinging slap, but the powerplay is enough to find him the gaps at sweeper",D Kulkarni to Lewis,FOUR

9236293,RR 1st Inns,15.1,"Markande to Samson, FOUR, drifting on leg-stump and it's been cutely paddled away. Runs very fine, through keeper's left and runs for a boundary. Not a great start that by Markande",Markande to Samson,FOUR
9236293,RR 1st Inns,15.4,"Markande to Samson, FOUR, he's joining the party. Very slow from Markande, trying to get Samson to miscue one, but doesn't on this occasion. Makes room, waits for the dip and lofts it over straight mid-on",Markande to Samson,FOUR

9236293,RR 1st Inns,4.3,"Krunal Pandya to Buttler, FOUR, wow! That is a fine shot. Moved away to leg and even a dragged back length didn't deter him, went up and over the infield off the back foot. A very difficult shot to play but Buttler made it look easy",Krunal Pandya to Buttler,FOUR
9236293,RR 1st Inns,5.4,"Hardik Pandya to Buttler, FOUR, that's more like it. Stand and deliver. Gets a length ball in his arc and he gives it his all. In fact it was the knuckle ball and Buttler dispatched it straight back over Hardik",Hardik Pandya to Buttler,FOUR
9236293,RR 1st Inns,7.0,"Bumrah to Buttler, FOUR, that was an attempted slower delivery but it turned out to be a full toss.

4623967,RCB 1st Inns,4.5,"Mohit Sharma to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, good adjustment from Parthiv. Seemed like he was early on this slower bouncer but then decided to just control it. Got it wide of short fine leg and that was enough. Brings up the 50 as well",Mohit Sharma to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4623967,RCB 1st Inns,5.0,"Mohit Sharma to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, this has been pummelled away.

Angled into the body from round the wicket, all Rahul has to do is to miss the lone fielder after swivelling across and that's what he does as he leaves Surya a mere statue",McClenaghan to Rahul,FOUR
3429315,KXIP 1st Inns,12.4,"McClenaghan to Finch, FOUR, mid-off is up so Finch clears his front leg in order to go over the infield. It's a short of length delivery from McClenaghan, not the ideal ball to hit straight down the ground, but Finch had his mind made up. He flat-bats it hard enough, and although it came off the toe-end, it's enough to go over the fielder. Cutting gives good chase and tries hauling it back in with a slide, but his foot was in contact with the ropes",McClenaghan to Finch,FOUR
3429315,KXIP 1st Inns,13.3,"Krunal Pandya to Finch, FOUR, he's hit that with a battering ram! Makes some room, Krunal darts it into the slot for Finch who tonks the leather off it by muscling it back over the bowler's head.

3429315,KXIP 1st Inns,17.4,"Cutting to Rahul, FOUR, oh my, this is extraordinary. The expression on Rohit's face, rather the blankness of it tells the story. Wide leg-cutter from Cutting, Rahul switches his stance and reverse-scoops it over short third man",Cutting to Rahul,FOUR
3429315,KXIP 1st Inns,17.5,"Cutting to Rahul, FOUR, he's done it again. He has done it again. Quite brilliant. Slower ball wide of off, and Rahul puts it over short third man's head. He's whisked into the 90s. Some player this lad",Cutting to Rahul,FOUR
3429315,KXIP 1st Inns,2.2,"Hardik Pandya to Gayle, FOUR, another short one, this time across the left-hander, Gayle tries to cut it away, gets a top-edge over the fly slip and towards fine third man for four",Hardik Pandya to Gayle,FOUR

3429315,KXIP 1st Inns,20.0,"McClenaghan to Manoj Tiwary, FOUR, short of length delivery at the body, swivelled away past short fine leg. But it doesn't matter. MI clinch this by three runs to stay alive in the tournament",McClenaghan to Manoj Tiwary,FOUR
3429315,KXIP 1st Inns,3.0,"Hardik Pandya to Rahul, FOUR, yet another slower one, errs in length this time, half-cook, and Rahul transfers his bodyweight into an elegant extra cover drive for four.

3429315,KXIP 1st Inns,3.1,"McClenaghan to Gayle, FOUR, geee, that was hit hard. Fuller ball just outside off, Gayle clears his front leg and slugs that over mid-on to the long-on fence for four. Lands just short of the rope. Odd how the top-edge carried and this didn't :O",McClenaghan to Gayle,FOUR
3429315,KXIP 1st Inns,5.1,"Krunal Pandya to Rahul, FOUR, a hint of flight, pretty good length, on off stump, Rahul gets down the wicket and lofts it nonchalantly towards long-on for four",Krunal Pandya to Rahul,FOUR

3429315,MI 1st Inns,13.3,"Rajpoot to Pollard, FOUR, sloppy work from Finch. A crisp drive to the left of mid-off, Finchy was late to react and hence the dive came in late, gets some hand on it, but ends up parrying it to the fence",Rajpoot to Pollard,FOUR
3429315,MI 1st Inns,13.4,"Rajpoot to Pollard, FOUR, full on the pads, CYA TOMORROW! KP was quick to pounce, just needed to help the ball and he did that with some ease, past square leg with courtesy a magical wristwork",Rajpoot to Pollard,FOUR

3429315,MI 1st Inns,4.2,"Mohit Sharma to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, edged and four, unlucky for the bowler, on a good length and a hint of seam away from the left-hander, drew Kishan into the drive and found a thick edge, past the lone slip and races away to the fence",Mohit Sharma to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
3429315,MI 1st Inns,9.5,"Stoinis to Pollard, FOUR, beautifully played, this should give Pollard some confidence, back of a length and wide of off, Pollard stands tall andc punches it in front of square on the off-side, beats cover and races away to the fence",Stoinis to Pollard,FOUR

2266358,RCB 1st Inns,1.1,"Shakib to de Villiers, FOUR, like Kohli de Villiers too gets off the mark with a boundary. Fraction short around off, de Villiers makes room and cuts wide of point. Expertly placed and it raced away",Shakib to de Villiers,FOUR
2266358,RCB 1st Inns,1.2,"Shakib to de Villiers, FOUR, this is how he started against Nadeem. Went bang bang. This is a top top shot. Shakib loops it up on the stumps, de Villiers gets forward and opens his body to go inside out over extra cover. That's trademark AB",Shakib to de Villiers,FOUR
2266358,RCB 1st Inns,11.2,"S Kaul to de Villiers, FOUR, how good is de Villiers. Unbelievably good.

2266358,RCB 1st Inns,11.3,"S Kaul to de Villiers, FOUR, now pulls regally and gets to fifty. Is this the knock that will win RCB the game tonight?

2266358,RCB 1st Inns,12.1,"Basil Thampi to Moeen Ali, FOUR, Moeen Ali gets to his maiden fifty. Gets a hug from de Villiers. Kohli punches the air in delight. They are happy for him and rightly so.

2266358,RCB 1st Inns,13.2,"Sandeep Sharma to de Villiers, FOUR, he doesn't want the wide, he wants more. Sits almost as he connects, back knee on the ground, reaches out to a slower delivery outside off, carves it over backward point. That's enough.

2266358,RCB 1st Inns,18.3,"Basil Thampi to Sarfaraz Khan, FOUR, my colleague Kumar who dines and drinks on stats tells me this - Basil Thampi now has the most expensive figures this IPL.

2266358,RCB 1st Inns,2.1,"Sandeep Sharma to de Villiers, FOUR, one-handed back foot square drive.

2266358,RCB 1st Inns,5.4,"S Kaul to de Villiers, FOUR, not sure whether it is four or six. de Villiers grits his teeth and it is not a six. Maybe AB thought it didn't go all the way. It has been sent upstairs. Has the ball landed bang on the cushion? After de Villiers lifted a length ball on the stumps towards wide long-on. Still looking. Umpire Chettithody Shamsuddin wants to get this absolutely correct in the third ump's box. They are zooming in and zooming out. Crowd keep waiting. S Ravi does too. To get the orders from above. They could have taken the strategic timeout and got done with it. More than 3 minutes as I type. Finally a decision has been made. It is four. And it is the right call too, one angle showed clearly that the ball bounced in front of the cushions. The game moves on - thankfully",S Kaul to de Villiers,FOUR
2266358,RCB 1st Inns,6.2,"Rashid Khan to de Villiers, FOUR, not sure what Rashid Khan is appealing for?

2266358,SRH 1st Inns,17.2,"Siraj to Manish Pandey, FOUR, slower ball, Manish Pandey waits till eternity and upper steers the ball over short third man for a four. 10 off the first two balls. Pressure back on RCB and Siraj as Kohli tries to egg his bowler on",Siraj to Manish Pandey,FOUR
2266358,SRH 1st Inns,18.1,"Southee to Manish Pandey, FOUR, slippery conditions or too casual was CDG? The batsman biffed the full and wide ball over the bowler.

2266358,SRH 1st Inns,2.1,"U Yadav to Hales, FOUR, Siraj is the man at mid-on.

Delightful from KW",Chahal to Williamson,FOUR
2266358,SRH 1st Inns,6.0,"Chahal to Hales, FOUR, the last ball goes for four. Dragged down and Hales lapped it over short fine's head. Needed to get enough bat to clear the fielder and did so. Poor end to the powerplay for RCB",Chahal to Hales,FOUR

9498235,RR 1st Inns,4.0,"U Yadav to R Tripathi, FOUR, shortish ball, Tripathi was expecting that. Remains back in his crease and heaves it over mid-wicket. Didn't get it off the middle, but had enough wood on it to go for a boundary. 13 off Umesh's second over",U Yadav to R Tripathi,FOUR
9498235,RR 1st Inns,4.1,"Southee to Rahane, FOUR, nicely done! Didn't over-hit and relied on timing. Scrambled seam short of length delivery, on the stumps, Rahane hops across and tucks it through square leg. No chance for the long leg fielder to cut it off",Southee to Rahane,FOUR
9498235,RR 1st Inns,5.1,"Chahal to R Tripathi, FOUR, lovely shot! Tossed up delivery, Tripathi dances down the track and in the process backs away to manufacture room. And then, follows it up with a sweetly timed lofted inside-out shot over extra cover",Chahal to R Tripathi,FOUR

9377212,KKR 1st Inns,17.3,"S Kaul to A Russell, FOUR, that top-edge to fine leg has arrived, beaten Sandeep Sharma and run away for a boundary.

9377212,SRH 1st Inns,1.4,"Prasidh to Dhawan, FOUR, was that a half-chance? Short and wide of off, Dhawan got on top of the bounce as he cut, didn't bother to keep it down, went to the right and well wide of Uthappa at backward point, the man in the deep has no chance",Prasidh to Dhawan,FOUR
9377212,SRH 1st Inns,14.3,"A Russell to Manish Pandey, FOUR, two dots and Pandey breaks free. Employs his dexterous wrists - ala Dhoni. Full and just outside off, Pandey jumped back and wristed it beautifully to bisect long-on and deep mid-wicket",A Russell to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9377212,SRH 1st Inns,15.0,"A Russell to Manish Pandey, FOUR, KKR have been very clumsy and poor in the field. Here's more evidence. Half-volley just outside off, Pandey slammed the drive wide of long-off and called ""Two"". Chawla was patrolling the fence and sprinted to his left, trips and loses his balance allowing the ball to roll away to the fence. Messy!",A Russell to Manish Pandey,FOUR

8897809,DC 1st Inns,15.0,"Mustafizur to Vijay Shankar, FOUR, edged and four, Vijay Shankar was clueless when he last batted against Mustafizur, but he gets away with a boundary first ball this time.

8897809,DC 1st Inns,15.3,"Hardik Pandya to Pant, leg byes, FOUR, poor line and length from Hardik, length ball on Pant's pads, he was looking to flick and missed, struck his pads and ran away fine, beat the keeper and rolled away to the fence",Hardik Pandya to Pant,FOUR
8897809,DC 1st Inns,19.1,"Cutting to Vijay Shankar, FOUR, another poor ball from Cutting, full-toss on Vijay Shankar's hips and all he had to do was to clip, he does so and beats the tumbling dive from Rahul Chahar - running across from fine leg",Cutting to Vijay Shankar,FOUR
8897809,DC 1st Inns,2.0,"Bumrah to Maxwell, FOUR, back of a length delivery angling towards off and middle, Maxwell shuffles across to get off-side of the ball and tickles it away to fine leg for four.

8897809,MI 1st Inns,0.1,"Lamichhane to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, poor start from the young leggie. Real loosener - a rank long hop, offering a freebie for Suryakumar first up. The batsman rocks back and murders it over mid-wicket",Lamichhane to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
8897809,MI 1st Inns,11.2,"Lamichhane to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, hammered! Pressure on the teenager.

8897809,MI 1st Inns,12.2,"Boult to Rohit, FOUR, there's the boundary for the over Mumbai need. Low full toss outside off, Rohit crouches a bit and uses the pace of Boult, opens the bat face and steers it between backward point and short third man",Boult to Rohit,FOUR
8897809,MI 1st Inns,13.0,"Boult to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, 17 off the over and that releases the pressure that Mishra and Lamichhane built up.

8897809,MI 1st Inns,17.1,"Plunkett to Cutting, FOUR, good way to start the over. Shade too straight from Plunkett, on off and middle, Cutting gets inside the line and whips it backward of square leg. He ensured that he got it past the man at short fine leg",Plunkett to Cutting,FOUR

9283980,CSK 1st Inns,18.4,"Andrew Tye to Raina, FOUR, sliced away in front of deep point, where the fielder dashes in only to find that he's badly misjudged it. Then he doesn't put his body behind it either, allowing it to slip past the side of him",Andrew Tye to Raina,FOUR

8593147,CSK 1st Inns,3.2,"S Kaul to Raina, FOUR, lovely, sublime timing from Raina, full toss outside off, he waits on it, uses the pace on the ball, plays with an open face and guides it behind square on the off-side, beats Manish and runs away to the fence",S Kaul to Raina,FOUR
8593147,CSK 1st Inns,5.4,"S Kaul to Dhoni, FOUR, lovely shot, too short from Kaul and he can't afford it at his pace, Dhoni swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it over square leg, no chance for the fielder at long leg",S Kaul to Dhoni,FOUR
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,0.4,"Chahar to Williamson, FOUR, that's what players like Williamson do. Let the bowler bowl to his strengths that is. It was full, but the line's wide of off-stump, KW leans forward and creams the drive wide of mid-off",Chahar to Williamson,FOUR
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,0.5,"Chahar to Williamson, FOUR, seam-up, searching for swing around middle and leg, too easy for Williamson as he shuffles to flick that wide of fine leg",Chahar to Williamson,FOUR
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,1.0,"Chahar to Williamson, FOUR, another hit-me on leg-stump, all Williamson needed to do was get some bat on that; he spots the line early and manages enough contact to clip that fine for a boundary. A wicket a three fours, an eventful over comes to an end",Chahar to Williamson,FOUR
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,13.0,"SN Thakur to Y Pathan, FOUR, boundary after ages. Much needed one for SRH. They need to get a move on here. Full and sliding on the pads, Pathan gets enough on the flick to clear Watto at mid-wicket. No chance for the fielder in the deep to cut it off",SN Thakur to Y Pathan,FOUR
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,14.0,"Jadeja to Y Pathan, FOUR, excellent placement from Pathan. Waited for the quicker delivery and then back cut it past a diving backward point. Once it beat Bhajji there was no stopping that. Superb spell from Jadeja, who has come into his own as the tournament has progressed, ends with 4-0-13-1",Jadeja to Y Pathan,FOUR
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,14.5,"Dwayne Bravo to Y Pathan, FOUR, Pathan has slowly started to up the ante. Slower short of length delivery and it sat up nicely for Pathan, who forehands the slap in front of square and gives sweeper cover no chance",Dwayne Bravo to Y Pathan,FOUR
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,19.4,"SN Thakur to Brathwaite, FOUR, wow! What power! This was close to yorker length, but Brathwaite used the depth of the crease nicely, went deep to get underneath it and hammered it over extra cover. There was a fielder in the deep but he had no chance",SN Thakur to Brathwaite,FOUR
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,2.0,"Lungi Ngidi to Goswami, FOUR, second slip would have gobbled that! Genuine outside edge. Just a push away from the body, the ball swerved away off a good length to click the edge and even a dive from first slip (to his left) wasn't good enough",Lungi Ngidi to Goswami,FOUR
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,2.3,"Chahar to Williamson, FOUR, smashed! Not an error from the bowler, but that shot was all about Williamson's class. Hawkeyed the ball and freed his arms to slaughter the cut through covers",Chahar to Williamson,FOUR
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,3.2,"Lungi Ngidi to Goswami, FOUR, too full and gets slammed! Right in the swinging arc for Goswami who times the pants of a flashy drive and gets it in the gap through covers",Lungi Ngidi to Goswami,FOUR
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,4.3,"SN Thakur to Shakib, FOUR, cross-seam delivery, width on offer, Shakib stands tall and stabs it through covers. The fielders on the off-side ring stay unmoved",SN Thakur to Shakib,FOUR

9461343,KKR 1st Inns,0.1,"Gowtham to Narine, FOUR, Narine wastes no time in getting away. Backs away to this flatter ball, to make room, and bashes it through the covers. KKR are away",Gowtham to Narine,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,1.0,"Gowtham to Uthappa, byes, FOUR, that's beaten everyone! Lots of turn on this off break and Uthappa brings out the reverse sweep to combat it. Cannot connect and Klaasen didn't anticipate the spin either. Races away",Gowtham to Uthappa,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,10.4,"Laughlin to Shubman Gill, FOUR, and now young Gill takes a leaf out of his skipper's book. The seam-up ball that held its line just outside off, Gill is pretty glued to the crease and smartly just uses the pace of the bowler to guide it to third man. Beats Sodhi on this occasion, who tried his best but couldn't stop it",Laughlin to Shubman Gill,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,13.3,"Shreyas Gopal to Shubman Gill, FOUR, there's that customary dragger from the leggie. Rare loose ball, short and width for the taking, Gill carves his bat staying deep and finds the gap, beats point",Shreyas Gopal to Shubman Gill,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,14.1,"Jofra Archer to Shubman Gill, FOUR, Eden Gardens is loving it. Fearsome striking by Gill. No margin for error at all, Archer errs by giving him the width, Gill stands tall and crashes it through extra cover. Fierce!",Jofra Archer to Shubman Gill,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,16.4,"Unadkat to A Russell, FOUR, Unadkat is not learning. Just shortens his length and keeps it outside off, Russell reaches out and slaps it through extra cover. Rocketed away to the fence",Unadkat to A Russell,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,19.1,"Laughlin to A Russell, FOUR, misses the length and Russell makes him pay. Clears his front leg, unleashes his bottom hand and whacks it across the line, the practice pitches help his cause. Trickles away wide of long-on",Laughlin to A Russell,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,19.5,"Laughlin to A Russell, FOUR, wow! Bludgeoned away. Russell gets deep in his crease, Laughlin fails to nail the yorker. And Russell caresses it through extra cover",Laughlin to A Russell,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,2.5,"Gowtham to Chris Lynn, FOUR, bludgeoned away! Typical brute force from Lynn. He had been trying to break free for a while now and finally, gets one away. Not much room, but he makes some by backing away and smacks it away through the gap at cover. Nobody moved",Gowtham to Chris Lynn,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,4.0,"Jofra Archer to Karthik, FOUR, beautifully timed! Karthik is away with a sublime stroke. Half volley on the pads, he latches onto it with a wristy flick that's placed quite wide of the fine leg fielder",Jofra Archer to Karthik,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,5.1,"Unadkat to Karthik, FOUR, up and over! Loosener from Unadkat to start with, wide half volley and Karthik just ensures that he clears the infield. That he does so with a front-footed lofted chip over cover. Easily done",Unadkat to Karthik,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,5.2,"Unadkat to Karthik, FOUR, cracking stroke! The previous one was a bad ball but this is just a stunning shot. There was width but on a length, Karthik just went through on the front foot and thumped the drive on the up. Bisected mid-off and extra cover easily",Unadkat to Karthik,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"Unadkat to Chris Lynn, FOUR, Lynn joins the party. Have to say that Unadkat is releasing all the pressure built with some poor bowling. Once again gifts width outside off and Lynn was waiting for this for a while now. Frees his arms to go over cover. Didn't middle that well but still had enough to go over the infield",Unadkat to Chris Lynn,FOUR
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,9.1,"Shreyas Gopal to Karthik, FOUR, deft by Karthik. This is sliding down leg and on the shorter side as well. He just gets across to get a tickle that beats Klaasen. Quick outfield and short fine leg's chase is in vain",Shreyas Gopal to Karthik,FOUR
9461343,RR 1st Inns,1.4,"Prasidh to Rahane, FOUR, feeds the pads. Rahane gets on his toes, shuffling inside the line and whippy hands in flicking it in front of square. The class .. sheer tons of it",Prasidh to Rahane,FOUR
9461343,RR 1st Inns,15.5,"Narine to Klaasen, FOUR, the reverse sweep! Played with disdain as he lofted it high over short third man for a four. He did it against the Indian spinners in South Africa. Rang a bell?",Narine to Klaasen,FOUR
9461343,RR 1st Inns,16.2,"Chawla to Samson, FOUR, low full toss, trying for a yorker but gets it wrong. That was 120kph! The batsman though stays calm, maintains his shape and open-faces the ball over cover for a four. The deep cover was too straight. Three men were around the point region",Chawla to Samson,FOUR
9461343,RR 1st Inns,2.1,"Chawla to R Tripathi, FOUR, rare float up. So unlike Chawla .. wide, asking for treatment. And obliged. Tripathi reaches out to the pitch, clearing his back leg and then full flowing hands as he drills it through the covers",Chawla to R Tripathi,FOUR
9461343,RR 1st Inns,20.0,"Prasidh to Gowtham, FOUR, mark the calendar! KKR vs SRH - 25th May! KKR win this by 25 runs as they did the choking act much better than RR in the death overs. RR's dream run has been stalled. The last ball was short, the pull was not controlled but went fine on the on-side for a four. Did not matter",Prasidh to Gowtham,FOUR
9461343,RR 1st Inns,3.1,"Prasidh to Rahane, FOUR, 134.1kph. Sitting up in the slot, nicely getting onto the hips at a good height for Rahane to latch. Does it with a swiping glance, getting airborne and pinching the mid-wicket gap",Prasidh to Rahane,FOUR
9461343,RR 1st Inns,3.2,"Prasidh to Rahane, FOUR, typical overcompensate. After a drifter into the pads, Krishna goes into a bouncer, wide outside off. Rahane has his timing tonight, and enough on it to jump-cut it square. The powerplay's enough to do its bit",Prasidh to Rahane,FOUR
9461343,RR 1st Inns,8.0,"Narine to Rahane, FOUR, no Rahane ain't cheeky enough for these late cuts. Just can't line himself up right, just about fetches it out of DK's gloves as he outside-edges it past the cordon. Ah, never mind",Narine to Rahane,FOUR
9461343,RR 1st Inns,8.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Samson, FOUR, juicy half tracker. Samson waits, waits some more. And some more. Loads up a pull, with all the muscle to swat it away through mid-wicket",Kuldeep Yadav to Samson,FOUR
9461343,RR 1st Inns,9.0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Samson, FOUR, rubs in some more elegance. Clears his back leg, reads the flight, reads the googly and inside-outs it over extra cover. Oh Kolkata need the breather .. time-out",Kuldeep Yadav to Samson,FOUR

1468999,KKR 1st Inns,10.3,"Rashid Khan to Chris Lynn, FOUR, Lynn has made his mind up. He isn't deviating from it. This is what he'll do, live or die.

1468999,KKR 1st Inns,10.5,"Rashid Khan to Karthik, FOUR, beautiful footwork from Karthik, so nimble. He's been in such sublime form. The length is short, which he picks in a flash, and pummels the pull through mid-wicket",Rashid Khan to Karthik,FOUR
1468999,KKR 1st Inns,15.4,"K Khaleel Ahmed to Shubman Gill, FOUR, stunning timing from Shubman Gill! Back of length outside off, Gill didn't even go through with this back foot punch.

1468999,KKR 1st Inns,18.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Shubman Gill, FOUR, Bhuvneshwar dared to put his hands up, but he wasn't stopping this.

1468999,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Narine, FOUR, wow, Bhuvi under pressure straight away! Is Narine the new Jayasuriya? A back of a length delivery drifting into the pads, a slog across the line, and a thick inside edge to backward square leg for four",Bhuvneshwar to Narine,FOUR
1468999,KKR 1st Inns,2.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Narine, FOUR, another back of a length ball, and just cross-batted disdainfully over the bowler's head for four. No respect!",Bhuvneshwar to Narine,FOUR

1468999,SRH 1st Inns,10.1,"Chawla to Shakib, FOUR, boundaries starting to flow for SRH. They need to move on here.

1468999,SRH 1st Inns,12.2,"Chawla to Shakib, FOUR, Shakib backed away to free his arms and unlike Narine, Chawla tosses it up on the stumps, right sort of room to play the drive and Shakib places it perfectly past extra cover, even beat long-off to his right",Chawla to Shakib,FOUR
1468999,SRH 1st Inns,14.2,"Narine to Shakib, FOUR, half tracker and Shakib makes him pay. There was ample width as well, Shakib reached out and flayed the cut behind square on the off-side, no chance for the sweeper cover to get across",Narine to Shakib,FOUR

1468999,SRH 1st Inns,18.0,"Prasidh to Rashid Khan, FOUR, streaky! But that is the way Rashid plays. Short and outside off, he just threw the kitchen sink at it and the top-edge flies over a leaping Karthik. Big over for SRH, but the loss of Brathwaite would hurt them",Prasidh to Rashid Khan,FOUR
1468999,SRH 1st Inns,19.1,"Prasidh to Bhuvneshwar, FOUR, good start to the over, some glove love as well between Bhuvi and Rashid. Short and outside off, Bhuvi arches back and carves the cut over backward point. No one out there to stop that from reaching the fence",Prasidh to Bhuvneshwar,FOUR
1468999,SRH 1st Inns,19.3,"Prasidh to Rashid Khan, FOUR, lovely batting from Rashid. It was the slower delivery and he didn't try to overhit it, saw mid-off inside the circle and delayed his loft for a second, struck it cleanly and got a one bounce four",Prasidh to Rashid Khan,FOUR
1468999,SRH 1st Inns,3.2,"A Russell to Dhawan, FOUR, smashed, Saha had to jump and get out of the way, it was coming at a rate of knots, back of a length delivery outside off, Dhawan got forward and absolutely drilled it back at the non-striker, no need to run for those",A Russell to Dhawan,FOUR
1468999,SRH 1st Inns,3.4,"A Russell to Dhawan, FOUR, lovely, four men in that off-side ring and still Dhawan manages to pierce the gap.

5179104,CSK 1st Inns,1.2,"Sandeep Sharma to du Plessis, FOUR, punched away off the back foot with a slightly horizontal bat. Stays forward and takes care of the shortish ball. Not too short and the batsman thumped the ball away. He is in good form",Sandeep Sharma to du Plessis,FOUR

5179104,CSK 1st Inns,17.0,"Rashid Khan to Watson, FOUR, the fielder at deep backward square leg has misjudged this. Watson slogged this in the air, the fielder dived but couldn't get there. On the biggest night, CSK have negated Rashid Khan without a wicket",Rashid Khan to Watson,FOUR
5179104,CSK 1st Inns,17.4,"S Kaul to Watson, FOUR, oh that's a bowler-killer. Luckily it didn't come very straight at Kaul. Very full from Kaul, Watson drills it hard and beats long-off",S Kaul to Watson,FOUR

5179104,SRH 1st Inns,7.5,"Dwayne Bravo to Williamson, FOUR, superb shot! It is not easy to hit Bravo's slower balls. But Williamson does it superbly. Just delayed his shot and lofted the full off-cutter over extra cover. The placement was also perfect as he got it wide of sweeper cover",Dwayne Bravo to Williamson,FOUR
5179104,SRH 1st Inns,8.4,"Jadeja to Shakib, FOUR, Shakib is off the mark with a boundary. Watto tries his best to stop it at short third man, but just couldn't get across. Fraction short and around off, Shakib manages to chop the cut behind square and Watson's dive is just an after thought. The sweeper also dives in vain near the boundary rope",Jadeja to Shakib,FOUR
7841262,CSK 1st Inns,0.5,"Chahar to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, MS won't be happy with this effort. It was touch fuller of good length and there was just enough room, Parthiv Patel throws his bat at it and creams the drive to mid-off. Shardul Thakur there misfields and it goes for a boundary to long-off",Chahar to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
7841262,CSK 1st Inns,14.1,"Jadeja to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, nicely done! It wasn't too wide, Parthiv Patel jumped back and slightly moved leg-side. And then, the lefty opened his bat-face to guide it fine of short third man",Jadeja to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
7841262,CSK 1st Inns,9.5,"Tahir to de Grandhomme, FOUR, leggie on the stumps, de Grandhomme clears his leg and flicks it nonchalantly, he finds the gap wide of long-on and it thuds into the fence. Welcome boundary for de Grandhomme and RCB",Tahir to de Grandhomme,FOUR

8883211,KKR 1st Inns,12.1,"Sandeep Sharma to Nitish Rana, FOUR, too easy. Full pitch up, Rana's down quickly as well, sweeping him with utter disdain into an behind square region. Zero respect",Sandeep Sharma to Nitish Rana,FOUR
8883211,KKR 1st Inns,13.2,"Rashid Khan to Nitish Rana, FOUR, just too short. Also the googly going away from him helps, which Rana's quick to pounce on with a fierce cut. And there's no one at point",Rashid Khan to Nitish Rana,FOUR

8883211,KKR 1st Inns,17.5,"S Kaul to A Russell, FOUR, more carnage. Russell's turning the tables, and turning them with muscle. Kaul dishes out another short sit-up outside off, for Russell to move away to, free up his arms and slap it away powerfully through extra cover",S Kaul to A Russell,FOUR
8883211,KKR 1st Inns,18.1,"Bhuvneshwar to A Russell, FOUR, well, well, well. Bhuvneshwar's got this one to reverse, tailing in sharply on the pads. But Russell's rocked behind in his crease, with all his bottom-hand coming in this whip through mid-wicket",Bhuvneshwar to A Russell,FOUR
8883211,KKR 1st Inns,18.3,"Bhuvneshwar to A Russell, FOUR, it's a joke. It really is. It's a yorker, no less, but Russell's adept at squeezing it away from leg-stump with a drill into long-off",Bhuvneshwar to A Russell,FOUR
8883211,KKR 1st Inns,2.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Nitish Rana, FOUR, clumsy from Rashid and he looks to be in some trouble - short of a length and well outside off, Rana gets on top of the bounce and cracked it straight to cover-point - Rashid jammed his fingers at the ball and let it slip through. 'It's paining', he says cheekily later",Bhuvneshwar to Nitish Rana,FOUR
8883211,KKR 1st Inns,2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa, FOUR, nicely done, short of a length and at the stumps, Uthappa gets inside the line and tucks it fine - backward square leg was inside the ring and has no chance",Bhuvneshwar to Uthappa,FOUR
8883211,KKR 1st Inns,3.2,"Sandeep Sharma to Nitish Rana, FOUR, lovely, fuller length delivery and at the stumps, Rana leans forward, head on top of the ball and then lets his wrists take over - drives it sumptuously wide of mid-wicket for a boundary",Sandeep Sharma to Nitish Rana,FOUR
8883211,KKR 1st Inns,4.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Nitish Rana, FOUR, edged and four, the slower off-cutter from Sandeep, did Rana in for pace - was early into the drive and the thick edge runs past the keeper for a boundary",Sandeep Sharma to Nitish Rana,FOUR
8883211,KKR 1st Inns,4.4,"S Kaul to Uthappa, FOUR, handy runs for Uthappa, backed away to a full ball and drove with a closed face - Kaul couldn't stop the ball on his followthrough and although it wasn't sweetly struck - managed to beat the diving mid-off fielder",S Kaul to Uthappa,FOUR
8883211,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"Shakib to Uthappa, FOUR, jumps down, a little too close for comfort eventually, but then has quick hard hands and good enough power in squeezing out this eventual yorker through sweeper. Yup, the powerplay does help ..",Shakib to Uthappa,FOUR
8883211,KKR 1st Inns,7.4,"Rashid Khan to Nitish Rana, FOUR, another ugly across-the-line swipe. And Uthappa's luck rubs into Rana, who goes hard, gets a thick top-edge, flying over slip",Rashid Khan to Nitish Rana,FOUR

8883211,SRH 1st Inns,1.4,"Chawla to Warner, FOUR, second boundary of the over! Not a great start by Chawla. Darts this one around off and Warner thumps it through the gap at covers once again. The outfield is lightning quick",Chawla to Warner,FOUR
8883211,SRH 1st Inns,10.1,"Nitish Rana to Bairstow, FOUR, cracking shot, dropped short and wide of off, Bairstow makes room and clatters it behind square on the off-side for a boundary",Nitish Rana to Bairstow,FOUR
8883211,SRH 1st Inns,11.5,"Ferguson to Bairstow, FOUR, streaky and four, short of a length and at the stumps, Bairstow was backing away on the pull, gets a thick inside edge that flies over the top of leg-stump",Ferguson to Bairstow,FOUR
8883211,SRH 1st Inns,12.2,"Chawla to Warner, FOUR, lovely, the wrong 'un from Piyush, but the length is well short, Warner makes room and clatters it over cover for a boundary",Chawla to Warner,FOUR

8883211,SRH 1st Inns,19.0,"Prasidh to Shankar, FOUR, handy runs for Shankar, on a length and tailing back into the right-hander, he waited on it and then clipped it backward of square on the on-side - right in the gap between the two fielders in the ring and it runs away to the ropes",Prasidh to Shankar,FOUR
8883211,SRH 1st Inns,19.4,"Ferguson to Shankar, FOUR, much-needed boundary for Shankar, spotted the slower ball and then delayed the pull, gets it wide of mid-wicket and runs away to the ropes",Ferguson to Shankar,FOUR
8883211,SRH 1st Inns,3.0,"Prasidh to Warner, FOUR, stand and deliver! No need to move, anyone. Stay put. Short in length around off, Warner rocks back and pulls it over mid-wicket. No fielders in the deep and that shall be four runs to end the over",Prasidh to Warner,FOUR
8883211,SRH 1st Inns,5.0,"Ferguson to Warner, FOUR, boundary to end the over! That'll spoil his first over. Bowls a low full toss outside off and Warner carves it through the gap at covers. The outfield does the rest",Ferguson to Warner,FOUR
8883211,SRH 1st Inns,5.4,"Narine to Warner, FOUR, fine start for SRH as the 50 comes up! A long hop down the leg side and Warner drags it past the fielder at short fine leg. Struggling with his lines is Narine",Narine to Warner,FOUR
8883211,SRH 1st Inns,5.5,"Narine to Warner, FOUR, another loosener down the leg side and it's been hacked through square leg by Warner. Clears the infield convincingly for four more",Narine to Warner,FOUR
8883211,SRH 1st Inns,6.2,"Kuldeep Yadav to Warner, FOUR, class! Returning to the IPL after a couple of years but it seems he never left. Premeditates and puts this one away to the third man fence with a fine reverse sweep",Kuldeep Yadav to Warner,FOUR
8883211,SRH 1st Inns,7.2,"Narine to Bairstow, FOUR, played! Finesse in that shot. Goes down on his knee and scoops the floater right past the keeper. No fine leg in place and that shall be four runs for YJB",Narine to Bairstow,FOUR
8883211,SRH 1st Inns,8.4,"A Russell to Warner, FOUR, impeccable power on that! Width on offer and Warner slams it past the fielder at covers. Just a boundary away from a lightning quick fifty, is Warner.

5789423,DC 1st Inns,1.2,"McClenaghan to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, hammered! Fractionally short and that's enough for Shaw to take it on, Goes on the front foot to launch the pull over mid-on. Gets it well wide and also comfortably over the fielder",McClenaghan to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,10.2,"Krunal Pandya to Ingram, FOUR, he was saving the power for this shot. It was full and was wide of off, Ingram smkoes it straight down the ground and it rockets to fence",Krunal Pandya to Ingram,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,10.4,"Krunal Pandya to Ingram, FOUR, this one was much slower from Krunal Pandya, he was guilty of providing width again. Ingram delays his bat swing and powers it wide of backward point for a boundary",Krunal Pandya to Ingram,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,10.5,"Krunal Pandya to Ingram, FOUR, bowling against left-handers for a left-arm spinner is never an easy prospect and Krunal Pandya is finding it really tough at the moment. It was on the shorter side and there was width, Ingram uses the width to good effect and punches it wide of cover for another four. He is looking in fabulous touch",Krunal Pandya to Ingram,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,11.3,"Bumrah to Dhawan, FOUR, Dhawan is finally getting a move on. He must have faced million balls of Bumrah in the nets and that experience comes to his advantage. He comes on the front foot and drives it wide of mid-off, it races along the carpet for a boundary",Bumrah to Dhawan,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,12.2,"Cutting to Ingram, FOUR, shot man! He is finding the gaps to perfection, moves across to the off-side and plays a cheeky little paddle over short fine for a boundary",Cutting to Ingram,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,12.4,"Cutting to Dhawan, FOUR, that is immaculate placement from Dhawan. He waits for the ball to arrive, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and guides it in between short third and backward point for a boundary",Cutting to Dhawan,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,14.2,"Cutting to Pant, FOUR, that is Pant-madness for you! It was a good length delivery on the stumps, Pant moves to the off-side and half-paddle-half-flicks it over short fine. He gets enough bat on it and it lands centimeters short of the boundary ropes",Cutting to Pant,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,14.5,"Cutting to Pant, FOUR, Pant gets lucky. It was a short of length delivery on the body, he was taken aback by how sharply it lifted off the deck and was too early on the pull shot. Gets it off the glove and just clears the keeper for a boundary",Cutting to Pant,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,15.5,"Hardik Pandya to Pant, FOUR, just to tell people that he can hit it over the off-side too. It was a slower one wide of off, Pant delays his bat swing just a little bit and powers it wide of long-off for a boundary",Hardik Pandya to Pant,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,16.3,"McClenaghan to Pant, FOUR, it takes some talent to hit that high full-toss for a boundary. And Pant indeed has that. Not the most elegantly but it surely was effective. It was a full-toss on the stumps, Pant stays in the crease and pumps it wide of long-off for a boundary",McClenaghan to Pant,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,17.0,"McClenaghan to Pant, FOUR, another boundary for Pant. In no time, he has moved to 41. It was short and was on the body, Pant somehow manages to pull it fine of fine-leg for a boundary. It looked extremely clumsy but got four runs for it",McClenaghan to Pant,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,17.1,"Bumrah to Axar, FOUR, Axar joins the party too. First off his firts ball. There was width on this delivery and Axar cuts it over backward point and wide of third man for a boundary",Bumrah to Axar,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,17.5,"Bumrah to Pant, FOUR, fifty for Pant. One of the better T20 knocks you would see. It was a back of a length delivery on the body, Pant gets behind it and half-pulls it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary",Bumrah to Pant,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,19.0,"Rasikh Salam to Pant, FOUR, no need to run for that. It was a full-toss wide of off and Pant in this form is not going to let it go. He reaches for it and tonks it wide of long-on, it rockets to the fence",Rasikh Salam to Pant,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,2.3,"Rasikh Salam to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, up and over! Overcooked from Salam and Iyer goes aerial. Front foot loft, comfortably over extra cover and it races away",Rasikh Salam to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,3.0,"Rasikh Salam to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, stylish shot! Not that bad a ball, almost the perfect yorker but Iyer was making room and with third man in the ring, it was only about beating that fielder. The DC captain does so by opening the bat face ever so late to find the gap. Timed sweetly as well",Rasikh Salam to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,4.0,"McClenaghan to Ingram, FOUR, superb shot! Full and wide, Ingram stays in his crease and drives this on the up square through the off-side. Timing was the standout factor as he threaded the stacked field set, through backward point and races away",McClenaghan to Ingram,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,5.1,"Hardik Pandya to Dhawan, FOUR, first real confident stroke that Dhawan has played tonight! Width on offer and he loves that. Stand and deliver on the slap-drive that pierces the gap at cover and blazes away to the fence",Hardik Pandya to Dhawan,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,7.1,"Hardik Pandya to Ingram, FOUR, just over a diving Pollard at backward point! Was shortish and a hint of room which Ingram pounced on with a flashing cut. Clears the infield, just, to get the boundary",Hardik Pandya to Ingram,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,8.1,"Krunal Pandya to Ingram, FOUR, great effort in the deep but can only palm it away to the deep mid-wicket fence. Was a loose half tracker on leg stump, Ingram swivelled and pulled it flat. On the bounce past the diving fielder near the rope",Krunal Pandya to Ingram,FOUR
5789423,DC 1st Inns,9.1,"McClenaghan to Dhawan, FOUR, not off the middle at all but Dhawan will take it. Has been struggling to force the pace tonight.

5789423,MI 1st Inns,10.3,"K Paul to Yuvraj, FOUR, this is a vintage Yuvraj shot! Rolled back the clock with this stroke. Overpitched from Paul and it's a nonchalant jab down the ground. Crisp, clean and sails over mid-off. Wow!",K Paul to Yuvraj,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,12.5,"K Paul to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, shot! Very full and outside off, Krunal drills the drive straight back past the bowler. Power and precision, tick!",K Paul to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,13.4,"Ishant to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, low full toss and width on offer, Krunal won't miss out as he blasts this through the covers. Belted it away with disdain",Ishant to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,13.5,"Ishant to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, this is rubbish bowling! With third man up, the only thing you shouldn't do is provide width. Ishant does just that and it's a full toss too to compound the miseries for DC. Krunal throws his bat at it and gets a slice that beats the fielder to the fence",Ishant to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,14.1,"Boult to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, Krunal is on the charge! Creating some momentum for MI but he has to bat deep. This is a yorker attempt gone wrong from Boult, a full toss and it's whipped away through the big gap at square leg",Boult to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,14.4,"Boult to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, Yuvraj must be wondering what's going on. He's getting yorkers at his end while Krunal gets full tosses. Here is another and it's blasted straight over the bowler's head. Like a rocket to the fence it goes. He's keeping MI alive",Boult to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,17.0,"Rabada to McClenaghan, FOUR, handy runs. McClenaghan it is this time. Premeditated the paddle scoop and got the length too, a full toss. Watched it onto the bat closely to guide it away fine down the leg-side to the fence",Rabada to McClenaghan,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,17.3,"Boult to Yuvraj, FOUR, streaky runs but it brings up Yuvraj's fifty! Not a bad MI debut for the veteran who has had his moments of luck too. Like this one. Slogged at it and got a thick edge that beat short third man to the fence",Boult to Yuvraj,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,18.0,"Boult to McClenaghan, FOUR, muscled over extra cover! Full and in the slot, McClenaghan backs away and lifts it powerfully. No protection in the deep",Boult to McClenaghan,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,2.3,"Boult to de Kock, FOUR, that's what he can do! Right into the slot around middle and leg, hint of tail into the batsman and it's been whiplashed past the man at mid-on by QdK",Boult to de Kock,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,2.5,"Boult to de Kock, FOUR, no stoppin him now! Boult presents a juicy freebie on the pads, a full toss and it's been helped past the man at short fine leg by the pocket sized dynamite. Has been a day of left handers. Warner earlier in the day, Pant in the previous innings and de Kock now",Boult to de Kock,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,3.2,"Ishant to Rohit, FOUR, why should QdK have all the fun? The Mumbai skipper joins in the party now. Waits for the slower delivery deep back in his crease and flicks it over short fine leg. Two fielders converge but none can stop it from reaching the fence",Ishant to Rohit,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,5.2,"Ishant to de Kock, FOUR, de Kock is keeping Mumbai alive in this chase. He's dealing in boundaries and absorbing all the pressure. A short delivery around middle and leg, de Kock swivels and puts it away to the fine leg fence, the fielder was too square to cut this down",Ishant to de Kock,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,5.3,"Ishant to de Kock, FOUR, fetch that! A length delivery around middle and leg, the left hander stays put and whacks it over mid-wicket. Making the most of the powerplay by playing these aerial shots",Ishant to de Kock,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,7.1,"Rahul Tewatia to Pollard, FOUR, smaaashed! Overpitched delivery around off, Pollard stands tall and thumps it over the bowler's head. That went quicker than a bullet to the fence",Rahul Tewatia to Pollard,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,8.5,"K Paul to Yuvraj, FOUR, Yuvraj finally connects one! Tad short outside off, pounces on the width on offer and chops it past the fielder at third man. His best timed shot of this innings so far",K Paul to Yuvraj,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,9.1,"Axar to Yuvraj, FOUR, Shikhar Dhawan makes a mess. There wasn't even a single there, but the batsman will get a boundary instead. Yuvi had swept the flatter delivery towards short fine leg where Shikhar misfields and lets it past him",Axar to Yuvraj,FOUR
5789423,MI 1st Inns,9.3,"Axar to Pollard, FOUR, that's nicely played! Was on the pads and Pollard clips it past the fielder at backward square leg. With the dew setting in, the lightning quick outfield beats the fielder's chase and takes it away to the fence",Axar to Pollard,FOUR
6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,0.2,"D Kulkarni to Rahul, FOUR, oh that's elegance personified! Nowhere near a half-volley length, a length delivery outside off, tempted into the drive, and thankfully it doesn't seam, driven on the up off the sticker to the sweeper cover boundary for four",D Kulkarni to Rahul,FOUR
6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,10.0,"D Kulkarni to Sarfaraz Khan, FOUR, yup, he can't resist his funk any longer.

6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,10.4,"Stokes to Gayle, FOUR, nearly the season's screamer .. Samson covers good ground, flies, but no, he's not as genetically blessed as a Holder. So it was short, with no pace as usual and Gayle's adjusted heave just can't be kept down. Luckily for him, it's a foot wide of deep mid-wicket",Stokes to Gayle,FOUR
6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,11.1,"Unadkat to Gayle, FOUR, pick. Heave. Dispatch. Very agricultural without a lot of feet, using the slow sitter to just swing across the line and smoke it into long-on",Unadkat to Gayle,FOUR
6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,11.2,"Unadkat to Gayle, FOUR, if being short was bad, this one's wide outside off as well. And for Gayle, it's a toy around. He walks back in the crease, waits for it to get close and times his cut perfectly backward of point",Unadkat to Gayle,FOUR
6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,11.3,"Unadkat to Gayle, FOUR, sheer exhibition on how you time your muscle. Unadkat tries cramping up the room and Gayle wrists a short arm pull, through mid-wicket",Unadkat to Gayle,FOUR

6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,15.0,"D Kulkarni to Sarfaraz Khan, FOUR, stays conventional, and reaps. Kulkarni, with the scars of the earlier ball still playing in his head, keeps it short, and Sarfaraz stays up tall to it and whacks it away square into mid-wicket",D Kulkarni to Sarfaraz Khan,FOUR
6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,15.2,"Stokes to Gayle, byes, FOUR, oh, Stokes will have to make his peace will only a moral victory. Nails the yorker, and it's quickly ripping through Gayle's legs. Too good for Buttler behind as well ..",Stokes to Gayle,FOUR
6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,15.3,"Stokes to Gayle, FOUR, and he's back to dishing out length. Gayle lets it get parallel, slices his cut violently, powerfully, one-bounced behind point",Stokes to Gayle,FOUR
6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,15.4,"Stokes to Gayle, FOUR, it's reached that stage where it just doesn't matter what you bowl. So this is on a back of a length, Gayle goes up tall to it and with a very straight bat-flow, tonks it over the bowler's head. Outrageous",Stokes to Gayle,FOUR
6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,18.2,"Unadkat to Pooran, FOUR, Pooran connects and finds the gap at deep extra cover. Another full and widish delivery from Unadkat outside off, Pooran throws his bat and crunches it in the gap to collect a boundary",Unadkat to Pooran,FOUR
6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,18.4,"Unadkat to Sarfaraz Khan, FOUR, carved over point! Very full and wide of off, the slower delivery from Unadkat. Sarfaraz gets low and flashes it with all his might. Third man fielder was straighter and had no chance",Unadkat to Sarfaraz Khan,FOUR
6728730,KXIP 1st Inns,19.2,"Stokes to Sarfaraz Khan, FOUR, unorthodoxy from Sarfaraz. Brings out his patented ramp, getting low in time and elevating it over the short third man fielder. Stokes has a cheeky smile on his face",Stokes to Sarfaraz Khan,FOUR

Rahane is a smart customer when it comes to manipulating the field in the PowerPlays.

9987700,MI 1st Inns,5.0,"Siraj to Rohit, FOUR, slapped past mid-off. Dismissive from Rohit. Sees a pitched up delivery outside off, loads up and absolutely smacks it off the meat with ferocity. All power from the MI skipper",Siraj to Rohit,FOUR
9987700,MI 1st Inns,5.3,"Navdeep Saini to de Kock, FOUR, dropped. CDG is the culprit and it should've been taken. A straightforward chance but the Kiwi all-rounder fails to cling onto it. Whacked hard and towards mid-wicket, I reckon CDG mistimed his jump and it bursted through his fingers. You cannot drop a form batsman like de Kock and this will hurt RCB",Navdeep Saini to de Kock,FOUR
9987700,MI 1st Inns,6.0,"Navdeep Saini to Rohit, FOUR, 50 comes up for MI with this boundary. They are off to a great start here. Saini misses his mark and hurls a delivery just outside off, Rohit went hard at that and skewed it over extra cover. Didn't come off the middle as the bat face turned in his hands",Navdeep Saini to Rohit,FOUR
9987700,MI 1st Inns,8.1,"Chahal to Suryakumar Yadav, byes, FOUR, the non-turner outside off, Suryakumar Yadav goes for a premeditated sweep shot and the ball scoots under his blade. Kept low too and hence the keeper couldn't stop that",Chahal to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
9987700,MI 1st Inns,8.5,"Chahal to Rohit, FOUR, 85.6kph, Chahal gives air on this occasion, but he's drifted it down leg. Easily put away by Rohit, who gets down on a knee and powerfully sweeps it backward of square leg",Chahal to Rohit,FOUR
9987700,MI 1st Inns,9.4,"de Grandhomme to Rohit, FOUR, another off-pace delivery - 111.5kph. The skipper picks it, gets down on a knee and swipes it over square leg. There's no one in the deep there",de Grandhomme to Rohit,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,0.4,"McClenaghan to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, Chota Gayle hits the first boundary for RCB. Easy length ball drifting down the leg-side, just the roll of the wrists on this shot and he placed it wide of mid-wicket",McClenaghan to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,10.1,"Markande to Kohli, FOUR, enough of dots, Kohli wants to get on with the game! Gets a full legbreak on off, with a high back lift and thumping wrists he powers it down the ground for a blazing boundary",Markande to Kohli,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,14.2,"Hardik Pandya to de Villiers, FOUR, Hardik Pandya is not happy with the effort from Suryakumar Yadav. Was a tough one, but chance nonetheless! No feet from AB, just swats the pull from the crease and it went flat to the right of wide long-on, SKY did well to anticipate it but in the end he went for the dive and lost track of the ball",Hardik Pandya to de Villiers,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,14.3,"Hardik Pandya to de Villiers, FOUR, that was pitched halfway down the track, AB hammers it with brute power over mid-wicket. Hadn't got the timing right, but he did well to place it in the gap",Hardik Pandya to de Villiers,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,15.4,"Malinga to de Villiers, FOUR, huge appeal for lbw, but no signs of review and rightly so. Off the willow. A loopy full toss from Malinga, AB had walked a long way and had to adjust to the line at the last moment, plants his front knee onto the ground and manages to find a flicker of an inside edge on the slog to send it fine past the keeper",Malinga to de Villiers,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,17.1,"Hardik Pandya to de Villiers, FOUR, AB shuffles and meets this ball on the full, sits on one knee and swats it in the gap between deep mid-wicket and deep square",Hardik Pandya to de Villiers,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,2.3,"McClenaghan to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, that's a nice pull shot, he's short in stature, but he packs a punch with his shots. A gentle step forward and then a pull over mid-wicket",McClenaghan to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,2.5,"McClenaghan to Moeen Ali, FOUR, top edge, but it flies high over QdK. Short fuller length on the stumps, Moeen was beaten for pace on the pull shot, gets away with it",McClenaghan to Moeen Ali,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,3.4,"Bumrah to Kohli, FOUR, oh this could so easily have been in mid-on's hands. Shortish delivery, Kohli pulls off the front foot, not in control, Yuvi was very wide there and had no chance. This is the battle of the best bowler v best batsman",Bumrah to Kohli,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,3.5,"Bumrah to Kohli, FOUR, outside edgeeee but safe! Kohli really throws his hands at this length delivery wide outside off stump, wanted a drive through cover, got a thick edge that went wide of slip and beat third man",Bumrah to Kohli,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,4.0,"Bumrah to Kohli, FOUR, this is a brilliant shot. Not a bad ball at all for the field set. Fullish and outside off stump, Kohli leans forward and punches it with an angled bat, splits backward point and cover-point",Bumrah to Kohli,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,4.5,"Hardik Pandya to Kohli, FOUR, Hardik Pandya missed his length by a couple of yards and that's all waht Kohli needed to get going. Back of a length and well outside off stump, Kohli cuts, beats backward point and look at him, he's fired up. Cheers himself up with a soft of fist pump, he didn't like being dominated/threatened by Hardik Pandya for those three deliveries",Hardik Pandya to Kohli,FOUR
9987700,RCB 1st Inns,5.0,"Hardik Pandya to Kohli, FOUR, and look at this cover drive, he's moved onto 20 and all have been boundaries. Fullish delivery outside off stump, Kohli leans forward and creams the ball along the ground, raced away to the boundary",Hardik Pandya to Kohli,FOUR

9059842,RR 1st Inns,10.5,"S Kaul to Rahane, FOUR, runs starting to flow from both ends now.. Rahane has also up the ante. Picked the short ball and pulled it backward of square, giving the fielder at deep square no chance of getting across",S Kaul to Rahane,FOUR
9059842,RR 1st Inns,11.5,"Shankar to Samson, FOUR, it is not working for Shankar. Hyderabad's fifth bowler is becoming a problem. Nadeem leaked runs and Shankar too is going for a few.

9059842,RR 1st Inns,13.2,"Sandeep Sharma to Rahane, FOUR, shot! He's bisected the two fielders with precision. 107ks knuckle ball around off, Rahane makes room and drives on the up past extra cover, where KW can't go full throttle on the dive as it is to his left and Rashid also can't get across from sweeper cover",Sandeep Sharma to Rahane,FOUR
9059842,RR 1st Inns,14.2,"Rashid Khan to Rahane, FOUR, Rahane getting innovative. Rashid is taken by surprise. The fast wrong 'un and Rahane decides to play the reverse sweep, more of a top-edge and the ball clears backward point before running away to the fence",Rashid Khan to Rahane,FOUR
9059842,RR 1st Inns,15.3,"Nadeem to Samson, FOUR, cheeky! Smart batting by Samson. He knows that Nadeem is firing 'em in and he uses that to his advantage, walks across his stumps and laps it over the keeper, the pace takes care of the rest",Nadeem to Samson,FOUR
9059842,RR 1st Inns,17.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR, wow! He's playing a gem here. Bhuvi misses the yorker by a couple of inches and that is enough for Samson, he opens the bat face and square drives it to the fence. Sweeper had no chance",Bhuvneshwar to Samson,FOUR
9059842,RR 1st Inns,17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR, and again.. Bhuvi does not look at his best in the death.

9059842,RR 1st Inns,17.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR, this is class batting. He is toying with the field.

9059842,RR 1st Inns,18.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR, 24 runs off the over. This is batting of the highest quality. No slogging or blind smashing but pure textbook cricket shots.

9059842,RR 1st Inns,19.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Stokes, FOUR, geez! Stokes showing he has the innovative game. He set up for the heave, then wanted to scoop but since the line was outside off, he reverse scooped it over short third man and the connection almost took it the distance",Bhuvneshwar to Stokes,FOUR
9059842,RR 1st Inns,19.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Samson, FOUR, hundred for Samson. Second in the IPL for him. Both have come in the last two seasons. He is making sure that Warne was right about his prediction. A innings of top quality. He raises bat and fist pumps both his hands. The Royals family love it and all are on their feet to applaud the innings. Short of length and Samson slaps the pull to long-on, the fielder gets across and dives but does not get enough to stop the ball",Bhuvneshwar to Samson,FOUR
9059842,RR 1st Inns,19.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Stokes, FOUR, Stokes being cheeky. He telegraphed his ploy very early, Stokes shuffled across to get inside the line and scoop it over short fine. He generated enough power to clear the fielder",Bhuvneshwar to Stokes,FOUR
9059842,RR 1st Inns,2.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Buttler, FOUR, 125.3kph. Top hands, and Buttler lets them overcompensate for the lack of feet. Leans back, lets it get close and steers his drive square",Bhuvneshwar to Buttler,FOUR

9059842,RR 1st Inns,4.4,"Sandeep Sharma to Rahane, FOUR, this is simple. Sandeep strays into the legs, and Rahane isn't foxed on this side of the wicket. Whips, with a lot of bottom-hand, splitting mid-wicket and mid-on",Sandeep Sharma to Rahane,FOUR
9059842,RR 1st Inns,8.3,"Rashid Khan to Samson, FOUR, deft. Samson clears his back leg, perhaps forcing Rashid to go straighter - which he does - and then uses all his pace on offer to merely stick his bat out in a paddled sweep, very fine",Rashid Khan to Samson,FOUR

9059842,SRH 1st Inns,11.4,"Stokes to Shankar, FOUR, lovely pull shot. Short delivery, but Shankar rocked back to power it through square leg, Unadkat runs to his left in the deep but can't stop it. But why is he running around near the rope and not bowling?",Stokes to Shankar,FOUR

9059842,SRH 1st Inns,5.5,"Jofra Archer to Bairstow, FOUR, 149.8km/h, but it's a half-volley on the pads - wasted pace. Just an effortless whip to the backward square leg fence for four",Jofra Archer to Bairstow,FOUR

9418332,DC 1st Inns,1.4,"Ferguson to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, whippage! Ferguson tries the slower delivery but offers a half volley on middle and leg, Shaw leans forward and whips it with a lot of bottom hand to deep mid-wicket",Ferguson to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,11.0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, quickly on a knee, and to his credit doesn't try getting under the already-full length. Instead settles to sweep, and does it straight down the ground",Kuldeep Yadav to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,11.2,"A Russell to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, juicy overcook - oh no it's a full toss - and Shaw has half a helicopter and half a flamingo. So he Dhoni-Pietersen's it through cow corner. Go, figure ..",A Russell to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,11.4,"A Russell to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, there's insult. And then there's this. Firstly Russell's bowling because he has to, and then he's been carted around, and to top it all, the one chance he creates it put down so damn casually. Iyer whips uppishly, doesn't get the distance, straight to Gill, who just lets it spill through",A Russell to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,11.5,"A Russell to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, full, outside off, Iyer slices hard, drilling it in fact through extra cover. More insult .. an injured soul to top an injured shoulder",A Russell to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,12.1,"Nitish Rana to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, quick, short, outside off. Never mind it spinning back in, Shaw's already deep enough in the crease and very cheekily dabbing it off the keeper's gloves",Nitish Rana to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,13.5,"Prasidh to Pant, FOUR, it's getting predictable. 97.8kph here, which Pant first presses forward to and then piles on the line already on the pads to help - with a lot of power in his whack of course - behind square",Prasidh to Pant,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,14.5,"Chawla to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, sitter googly. Shaw sits over it, no sorry stands over it, and slaps it away hard, and doesn't even bother keeping it down as he goes over cover",Chawla to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,15.2,"Ferguson to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, threatens with the bouncer, but Shaw's not not taking it on. He's waiting deep in the crease just for it and swivels in his hook to put it away very fine",Ferguson to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,15.4,"Ferguson to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, short again. Shaw goes 180-degrees the other way now .. makes room and upper-cuts, over short third man",Ferguson to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,16.1,"Prasidh to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, oh he wants a century. And Krishna surely is helping him to it. An overtly friendly drifter down leg, Shaw stays his ground, picks and dispatches it off his legs past the diving keeper",Prasidh to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,16.4,"Prasidh to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, and he has the time to rub in some grace as well into this carnage. The full-faced punch down the pitch, which should ideally have been just a couple, but Russell just doesn't dive. Poor guy, he just can't",Prasidh to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,18.4,"Ferguson to Ingram, FOUR, short, angling across. But Ingram goes almost as deep as his stumps and waits for the slant to get big as he pulls it away, splitting the massive leg-sided gap perfectly",Ferguson to Ingram,FOUR

9418332,DC 1st Inns,2.2,"Chawla to Dhawan, FOUR, up and over. This is good intent from Dhawan. Shimmies down the wicket and gets a bit too close to the delivery, but still goes through with the loft and clears a leaping Russell near the mid-off ring",Chawla to Dhawan,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,5.2,"A Russell to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, overpitched and Shaw does not miss out, he stays leg-side of the ball and lifts it over mid-off. Just managed to clear Ferguson on the edge of the 30-yard circle",A Russell to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
9418332,DC 1st Inns,7.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, he connects and that should be a relief. Floated up outside off and that was in the slot for Iyer, who free his arms and smashes it straight back over his partner",Kuldeep Yadav to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR

Lucky start!",Rabada to Nikhil Naik,FOUR
9418332,KKR 1st Inns,0.5,"Rabada to Chris Lynn, FOUR, excellent timing! Another delivery pitched on a full length by KG, Chris Lynn leans forward and just play a gentle push.

9418332,KKR 1st Inns,14.4,"Chris Morris to A Russell, FOUR, uhhh! That was streaky but KKR won't mind it. Low full toss close to the yorker range, Russell bends down to try and squeeze it out, the under edge bounces past the stumps and races to the fine leg fence",Chris Morris to A Russell,FOUR
9418332,KKR 1st Inns,14.5,"Chris Morris to A Russell, leg byes, FOUR, loses his radar does Morris. Tries to follow Russell and cramp him for room, but sprays it too far down leg, the ball takes a deflection off the pad and beats Pant to his left",Chris Morris to A Russell,FOUR
9418332,KKR 1st Inns,15.1,"Harshal Patel to Karthik, FOUR, power from one end and finesse from the other - perfect combination.

9418332,KKR 1st Inns,16.3,"Rabada to A Russell, FOUR, fifty for Russell. This might be a very typical Russell innings but the circumstances were different as compared to the previous two outings.

9418332,KKR 1st Inns,17.2,"Chris Morris to A Russell, FOUR, even fours matter for Russell. It is not only about sixes. A few inches short of yorker length and that is enough for Russell to go through with his heave, one bounce and over the ropes near deep mid-wicket",Chris Morris to A Russell,FOUR
9418332,KKR 1st Inns,17.4,"Chris Morris to A Russell, FOUR, this is top top batting. Fires the yorker from round the wicket but Russell is up for it, he makes room and bends down to squeeze it past backward point, the pace of Morris took care of the rest",Chris Morris to A Russell,FOUR

9418332,KKR 1st Inns,3.5,"Lamichhane to Uthappa, FOUR, off the mark with a boundary! Scored a fifty in the last match too. Plants his front foot forward and creams the legbreak through the gap at covers. The outfield is quick enough to get him off the mark with four runs",Lamichhane to Uthappa,FOUR

9418332,KKR 1st Inns,5.5,"Harshal Patel to Uthappa, FOUR, that shot proves how good a form Uthappa is in. Was a shortish delivery outside off, Robbie makes the width on offer and chops it past the fielder at point",Harshal Patel to Uthappa,FOUR
9418332,KKR 1st Inns,7.0,"Rabada to Karthik, FOUR, intent from the skipper! Wastes no time. Gets a half-volley on the pads and DK flicks it with nonchalance. The timing was such that the fielder had deep mid-wicket could nothing else than admire the shot",Rabada to Karthik,FOUR
9418332,KKR 1st Inns,9.0,"Mishra to Karthik, FOUR, that's a lucky boundary for KKR! Was the slider outside off, DK goes for a cut and gets an underedge.

1894737,RCB 1st Inns,0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, lovely, on a good length and well outside off, Parthiv leans into the drive, plays it on the up and finds the gap to the left of cover - no need to run for those",Bhuvneshwar to Parthiv Patel,FOUR

1894737,RCB 1st Inns,12.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Prayas Barman, FOUR, well-directed short ball from Kumar but Barman manages to help it over the keeper.

1894737,RCB 1st Inns,13.0,"Bhuvneshwar to de Grandhomme, FOUR, Kumar continues to struggle with his lines. Attempted pitched up delivery, ends up in the slot for Grandhomme who makes merry. Hoicking it over wide long-on",Bhuvneshwar to de Grandhomme,FOUR

1894737,RCB 1st Inns,14.3,"S Kaul to Prayas Barman, FOUR, 50-partnership comes up with this boundary. Short ball that lacks pace, Barman gets into a wonderful position and connects the pull sublimely over square leg",S Kaul to Prayas Barman,FOUR

1894737,SRH 1st Inns,1.0,"Moeen Ali to Bairstow, FOUR, third boundary of the over. And SRH are off to a flyer. There was room on this delivery, Bairstow stays put in the crease and cuts it past backward point for a boundary. Excellent placement!",Moeen Ali to Bairstow,FOUR
1894737,SRH 1st Inns,11.1,"U Yadav to Bairstow, FOUR, this is sheer carnage from Jonny and Warner. It was a back of a length delivery on the body, Bairstow pulls it brilliantly wide of deep square leg for a boundary",U Yadav to Bairstow,FOUR
1894737,SRH 1st Inns,12.0,"U Yadav to Bairstow, FOUR, gee! Look at the bat speed on that speed. It came at around 140 kph and was dispatched by Jonny even quicker. On a fuller length and on the stumps, Bairstow smashes it wide of mid-off for another boundary",U Yadav to Bairstow,FOUR

Backward point dived, but to no avail",Siraj to Warner,FOUR

1894737,SRH 1st Inns,3.4,"Siraj to Bairstow, FOUR, that's an old-fashioned heave from Bairstow. He gets behind that back of a length delivery and tonks it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary.",Siraj to Bairstow,FOUR
1894737,SRH 1st Inns,3.5,"Siraj to Bairstow, FOUR, that's edged and four. They are dealing in boundaries here. It was short and there was width, Bairstow throws his hands at it. It comes off the outside half of the bat and it runs wide of third man for a boundary",Siraj to Bairstow,FOUR
1894737,SRH 1st Inns,4.5,"U Yadav to Bairstow, FOUR, 50-run-partnership comes up between this pair. They have been the best opening pair in this season's IPL so far.

He is a magician in that area of the ground",U Yadav to Bairstow,FOUR
1894737,SRH 1st Inns,5.2,"Siraj to Bairstow, FOUR, oh Jonny, you are clearing the fields with mishits too. It was a slower one, Bairstow wanted to loft it down the ground, his timing was in a mess.

1894737,SRH 1st Inns,5.3,"Siraj to Bairstow, FOUR, don't bowl short to Bairstow. You just't can't, Siraj. It was short and was wide of off, Bairstow cuts it formidably well, beats point and cover and it races to the fence in a canter",Siraj to Bairstow,FOUR
1894737,SRH 1st Inns,8.3,"Prayas Barman to Bairstow, FOUR, this is an ordinary effort from Siraj at long-on. And he gifts a boundary to Bairstow. It was on the pads and Bairstow flicks it wide of long-on. Siraj at long-on was clumsy in the deep and he lets it through",Prayas Barman to Bairstow,FOUR
1894737,SRH 1st Inns,8.4,"Prayas Barman to Bairstow, FOUR, maiden fifty for Bairstow in the IPL. Brilliant innings from the Englishman. He is giving a taste of IPL cricket to the young man now.

3406149,CSK 1st Inns,12.0,"Unadkat to Raina, FOUR, 130kph. Just too straight, and this in no way is helping Rajasthan's cause here. Raina won't complain though, surely not with fine leg in the circle, tickling it fine",Unadkat to Raina,FOUR
3406149,CSK 1st Inns,13.1,"Unadkat to Dhoni, FOUR, that's how you deal with the slower balls. A short of length delivery from round the wicket, Dhoni dances down the track and smashes it over Raina's head. One bounce and into the long-on fence. All power!",Unadkat to Dhoni,FOUR
3406149,CSK 1st Inns,14.2,"Stokes to Dwayne Bravo, FOUR, Stokes shortens his length, Bravo waits for it from the crease and uses his wrists to elevate it over extra cover. Didn't quite middle it, but had enough to get it over Gowtham",Stokes to Dwayne Bravo,FOUR

3406149,CSK 1st Inns,17.5,"D Kulkarni to Dwayne Bravo, FOUR, 99.9kph, too slow. Bravo picked that but still was early into his shot. Gave himself some room to go over point, gets a top-edge that evades short third man to his right",D Kulkarni to Dwayne Bravo,FOUR

3406149,CSK 1st Inns,4.3,"D Kulkarni to Raina, FOUR, 131.3kph. Kulkarni will have to do with a moral victory. It's the bouncer, which makes Raina wait on his committed pull position, only to then take the top-edge and fly over the keeper",D Kulkarni to Raina,FOUR

7416638,MI 1st Inns,3.4,"SN Thakur to Rohit, FOUR, in the airrrr and just wide of cover-point. It went just a yard or two away from Raina's outstretched left arm. Short and wide delivery, poor delivery, Rohit cuts uppishly and gets away with it",SN Thakur to Rohit,FOUR
7416638,MI 1st Inns,4.2,"Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, now then, this is too much from CSK!

A simple on-drive it looks like, but it's tough to play an on-drive with a straight bat to the right of mid-on, let the short of length delivery come and timed it sweetly, Rayudu gives chase and loses the race",Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7416638,MI 1st Inns,4.4,"Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, freebie down the leg-side and Suryakumar won't miss out after this kind of a start, a gentle flick shot in the gap at mid-wicket and that's all you need at the Wankhede with a fast outfield",Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7416638,MI 1st Inns,9.5,"Jadeja to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, out comes the reverse paddle from Krunal, third man was inside the ring, so he did well to get bat on ball and it escaped to the boundary to ease some pressure",Jadeja to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
2313937,DC 1st Inns,0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, oh my word! What a shot, definitely not a bad ball at all. The end result of this back foot punch was great, but that's not how you should actually be playing. Worked on that occasion, could have been a drag on another day. Inswinger from Bhuvi, Shaw has this strange ability to play off the back foot to ones that aren't actually short, the ball escapes through the gap at cover",Bhuvneshwar to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2313937,DC 1st Inns,0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, it's such a poor idea to remove the slip without seeing through at least one over, Bhuvi does this time and again, now one escapes through the vacant cordon, a wide slip would have had him. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Shaw looks to punch off the back foot, gets a thick edge that runs away to the third man fence",Bhuvneshwar to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2313937,DC 1st Inns,10.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Rahul Tewatia, FOUR, lovely shot! Tewatia can bat. And he can to do it at a brisk rate. Delhi would want him to get them the momentum. On a length around off, Tewatia stays leg-side and uses the space he created to drive on the rise past mid-off",Sandeep Sharma to Rahul Tewatia,FOUR
2313937,DC 1st Inns,12.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, much needed for Delhi. The crowd find their voice with this boundary. Sandeep bangs it in short and at his pace on this surface it sat up, Iyer thumps the pull over mid-wicket and the ball raced away to the fence",Sandeep Sharma to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2313937,DC 1st Inns,13.5,"S Kaul to Chris Morris, FOUR, almost similar to the Ingram delivery. Slow but on the shorter side outside off, Morris keeps the cut down and hits it behind point, got enough power to beat third man in the deep",S Kaul to Chris Morris,FOUR
2313937,DC 1st Inns,14.5,"Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, that is a top shot. Iyer has been so good today. He has waited for the bad delivery and once he has got one, he's ensured to put it away. This was an overpitch and Iyer smacks it straight back over Rashid",Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2313937,DC 1st Inns,19.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Axar, FOUR, fine shot from Axar! Width on offer and although the length isn't very full, his hands do the rest as he powers this through extra cover. Finds the gap perfectly",Bhuvneshwar to Axar,FOUR
2313937,DC 1st Inns,5.2,"Nabi to Dhawan, FOUR, this time backward square leg is back for Nabi, but Dhawan sweeps this very fine from him and also takes out the man at 45, nicely placed",Nabi to Dhawan,FOUR
2313937,DC 1st Inns,7.1,"Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, full toss to begin with, Iyer creamed that nicely along the ground to cover, freebie to begin with from Rashid Khan",Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,0.5,"Lamichhane to Bairstow, FOUR, fine shot to start for Bairstow! Picked the googly and got across on one knee to sweep it hard. Connected well, got it wide of short fine leg and it raced away",Lamichhane to Bairstow,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,13.3,"Rahul Tewatia to Hooda, FOUR, and here's the overcompensated rubbish to follow up the ripper. Drifting well down leg, very full too .. and swept away firmly behind square",Rahul Tewatia to Hooda,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,15.3,"Lamichhane to Y Pathan, FOUR, when you're six-foot-something, you'd rather use it. Well Pathan does, stretching forward big time, getting to the pitch of the ball outside off and nailing his sweep behind square. Rabada tries sweeping and diving, but no, can't",Lamichhane to Y Pathan,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,17.4,"Chris Morris to Nabi, FOUR, oh easy. Short, but not short enough. Leg-lined and leg-lined enough. Quick and real quick enough. All Nabi needs is a bat, swivelling, pulling and getting enough of a tickle fine past the keeper",Chris Morris to Nabi,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,18.2,"Rabada to Nabi, FOUR, drags it off the inside half, ahh, no wonder it's a batsman's game. Rabada tries a slower cutter on the stumps, which Nabi makes room to and tries slicing over the covers -- but ends up with the edge on the inside pulling through an empty cow corner. Just a shot stands in between Hyderabad and a victory",Rabada to Nabi,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,2.2,"Lamichhane to Bairstow, FOUR, more runs! A wild slog this time from Bairstow who picked the googly but got it off the inside half of the blade. Still had enough on it to find the deep mid-wicket fence",Lamichhane to Bairstow,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,3.1,"Chris Morris to Bairstow, FOUR, he's carrying on from where he right off in Hyderabad. DC are helping him by offering pace too. Morris bangs this short and that's right down Bairstow's ally. Forehand pull pumped away to the deep mid-wicket fence",Chris Morris to Bairstow,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,3.2,"Chris Morris to Bairstow, FOUR, clears the infield! Bairstow's intentions very clear, he wants to kill the game in the Powerplay. Not really in the slot but he goes through with the chip shot down the ground. Easily over mid-on and it speeds to the fence",Chris Morris to Bairstow,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,3.4,"Chris Morris to Bairstow, FOUR, he's toying around with the bowling, Bairstow. Another loose half tracker and he picks it up with a shovel pull over short fine leg. Wrong line and duly punished",Chris Morris to Bairstow,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,4.0,"Chris Morris to Bairstow, leg byes, FOUR, bonus runs! They all count though. Pacy delivery on leg stump, was a freebie in every sense and though Bairstow couldn't get bat on the flick, it brushes the pad and splits the keeper and short fine leg",Chris Morris to Bairstow,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,4.1,"Axar to Warner, byes, FOUR, It goes through everyone. It was a short of length delivery, keeps low, Warner was taken aback by the low bounce. He fails to get any bat to it. It misses the leg-stump by a whisker and the low bounce beats Pant too",Axar to Warner,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,4.4,"Axar to Bairstow, FOUR, Jonny is on fire! He dashes down the ground, wasn't to the pitch of the ball still goes through with the shot and times it well enough to smash it down the ground for a boundary",Axar to Bairstow,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,5.2,"Rabada to Bairstow, FOUR, kind of a shot Jonny would salivate upon for days! It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps, Bairstow takes a good stride forward and creams it through cover for a boundary. Another 50-run wasy partnership for Jonny and Warner. It's an easy game for them at the moment",Rabada to Bairstow,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,5.4,"Rabada to Bairstow, FOUR, wow! Jonny, you champion! He can't do nothing wrong at the moment. Waits for the slower one, delays his bat swing and tonks it straight down the ground",Rabada to Bairstow,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,5.5,"Rabada to Bairstow, FOUR, that's edged and four! All of a sudden, this has become a different match. We are playing on the same wicket, mind you! It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, Bairstow waits for it to arrive and opens the face of the bat at the very last moment to guide it past third man. No stopping that!",Rabada to Bairstow,FOUR
2313937,SRH 1st Inns,9.4,"Chris Morris to Shankar, FOUR, gee! He is in some form these days, few months back, he would have hit it straight to cover. But, not now! He clobbers it over cover, bat turns in his hands but that didn't make any difference. It canters to the fence",Chris Morris to Shankar,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,0.5,"Southee to Chris Lynn, FOUR, adding insult to injury. Poor follow up delivery from Southee, drifting on the pads and Lynn duly puts it away with a fine clip off his pads over short fine leg",Southee to Chris Lynn,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,1.0,"Southee to Chris Lynn, FOUR, not a good finish by Southee. Another loosener outside off, too short and wide of off. Lynn throws his bat and drills it hard along the ground through extra cover. Strong bottom-hand power and beats a desperate dive from Klaasen at sweeper cover",Southee to Chris Lynn,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,1.3,"Navdeep Saini to Narine, FOUR, the plan was right from Saini, almost had Narine in trouble but somehow the batsman manages to help it away towards the fine leg fence. Bouncer following Narine, who was moving to leg and he gets cramped for all room because of the spicy bounce but Narine manages get it away to the boundary",Navdeep Saini to Narine,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,1.4,"Navdeep Saini to Narine, FOUR, miss the yorker, get set to face the penalty. Saini misses it by an inch, ends up as a low full toss and Narine after clearing his front leg, whips it to the left of mid-on. Raced away in a jiffy",Navdeep Saini to Narine,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,14.3,"Negi to Nitish Rana, FOUR, blasted away! Much-needed for KKR. Gets width on offer and he was hanging back for the slap-cut. Smashed hard and it's wide of sweeper as well",Negi to Nitish Rana,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,16.4,"Navdeep Saini to Karthik, FOUR, almost a blinder at mid-off by Kohli! Dived swiftly to his left and had it in his left hand mid-air but couldn't hold on. RCB have spilled quite a few already tonight and though this isn't an easy one, you'd hope that some stick at least. Was a bludgeoning drive from DK and he couldn't quite keep it down. Nearly paid the price but eventually gets a boundary",Navdeep Saini to Karthik,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,18.5,"Southee to A Russell, FOUR, more runs! He can do no wrong! Short ball this time, Russell waits for it and ramps merrily over Parthiv. Races away to the fence in no time",Southee to A Russell,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,3.5,"Navdeep Saini to Uthappa, FOUR, top-edge and over the keeper. Sometimes extra pace can let you down but Saini shouldn't mind this. Bouncer, rearing off the deck and Uthappa for the nth time tries the pull and gets a top-edge to his favour",Navdeep Saini to Uthappa,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,4.3,"Southee to Chris Lynn, FOUR, larruped over mid-on. Easy-peasy for Lynn. Southee missed the yorker, Lynn gets deep and clears his front leg to whip it firmly over the in-field",Southee to Chris Lynn,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,4.4,"Southee to Chris Lynn, FOUR, back-to-back fours for Lynn. He's getting a move on. Southee overcorrects and slips in the slower short ball, Lynn waits and pulls it after twirling his wrists behind square. Big gap and he will earn a boundary",Southee to Chris Lynn,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,5.0,"Southee to Uthappa, FOUR, textbook-esque inside-out loft from Uthappa. All class from Robbie. Expensive over for RCB. Nothing delivery from Southee, pitches it right in the slot and Uthappa gets forward and just stylishly lifts it over extra cover",Southee to Uthappa,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,6.2,"Siraj to Uthappa, FOUR, woah! All timing from Uthappa. Very cheeky, saw the width provided, so just waited deep and steered it behind point. This outfield is pretty quick and third man can't cut it off",Siraj to Uthappa,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,6.4,"Siraj to Uthappa, FOUR, Siraj is epitome of waywardness. Slips this one down leg, just help-your-self-with-a-boundary ball. Uthappa accepts it with glee and walks across to tickle it very fine",Siraj to Uthappa,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,8.3,"Siraj to Uthappa, FOUR, stand and deliver from Uthappa. Half-volley from Siraj, begging to be hit and Uthappa takes his front foot across and slams the drive with brute power past mid-off. Nobody moved and it sped off the bat in a hurry",Siraj to Uthappa,FOUR
1415953,KKR 1st Inns,9.0,"Siraj to Uthappa, FOUR, this is ridiculous from Siraj. The slower bouncer, well wide of off and third man was inside the ring. Too easy for Uthappa, just waited and dinked it effortlessly over the fielder at 45. Big over for KKR, 19 coming off it",Siraj to Uthappa,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,0.2,"Prasidh to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, early signs that this deck is a beauty. It was banged in short, came at a comfortable hip-height for Parthiv and he whips it over short fine for a boundary",Prasidh to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,0.5,"Prasidh to Kohli, FOUR, Kohli-special! Treat for the crowd. It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps, Kohli takes a good stride forward and leans into it, he times the drive superbly well. It beats the cover and races to the fence",Prasidh to Kohli,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,1.0,"Prasidh to Kohli, FOUR, back-to-back fours for Kohli. And this crowd is buzzing with excitement. Prasidh is looking for some swing on offer, he bowls another fuller length delivery, Kohli takes a good stride forward and drives it like a boss through cover. No stopping that!",Prasidh to Kohli,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,10.2,"Chawla to de Villiers, FOUR, gets loop, gets room, gets turn too. And AB decides to help it along .. stepping forward a touch and lofting it inside-out over extra cover",Chawla to de Villiers,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,10.4,"Chawla to Kohli, FOUR, 50*35. Chawla drags the length back, which means Kohli decides to wait. And wait. And wait some more, before fetching a real late cut out of DK's gloves to guide it real fine",Chawla to Kohli,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,12.2,"Narine to de Villiers, FOUR, dropped short. AB makes it look much, much worse, rocking behind in the crease and then throwing his weight behind a tonked loft, splitting long-off and extra cover in the deep perfectly",Narine to de Villiers,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,12.5,"Narine to de Villiers, FOUR, another backing in, another flat-batted throw, and another hammer over extra cover. Oh he's making it a habit, a very, very lovely-looking habit",Narine to de Villiers,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,14.1,"Nitish Rana to Kohli, FOUR, 105.6kph. Yorker. Leg-lined. Kohli's wrists are quicker, with a lot of bottom-hand flicking it away behind square. Kuldeep sweeps from fine leg, dives, and his palm can only parry it over",Nitish Rana to Kohli,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,15.5,"Prasidh to de Villiers, FOUR, 110.9kph, ah, Djoker! The change up finally goes wrong. AB reads the long hop, stands up full height and forehands it inside-out over extra cover. It's his fifty too -- 30th",Prasidh to de Villiers,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,16.0,"Prasidh to de Villiers, FOUR, the horrors of a wide full toss. High. Lots of width. AB doesn't overhit, piling on and just slicing it behind point",Prasidh to de Villiers,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,16.2,"Ferguson to Kohli, FOUR, 130.7kph, just too full. Kohli's already deep in his crease, incubating half vollies and then carving them inside-out over long-off",Ferguson to Kohli,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,17.3,"Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis, FOUR, big edge. Stoinis misreads the googly, wafts down the wrong line, but what are outside-edges for? The ball gropes at it, running through the slip cordon",Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,19.3,"Prasidh to Stoinis, FOUR, 150.3kph in a low full toss. Stoinis' measured this field, he knows Krishna can't bowl short with the first ball wide and then sits way, way inside his crease to slash it away through an empty point",Prasidh to Stoinis,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,2.1,"Narine to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, gee! Parthiv Patel is in some form. He goes down on his knees and slog sweeps it over deep mid-wicket with utmost ease for a boundary",Narine to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,20.0,"Prasidh to Stoinis, FOUR, and gets funky. Shuffles, doesn't mind showing away his stumps as he scoops this one really fine .. 18 off this one, 205 in all, and Bangalore nail the perfect finish!",Prasidh to Stoinis,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,3.1,"Ferguson to Kohli, FOUR, ball has flown off the bat. Wow! What timing! Ferguson did the mistake of bowling on the pads and Kohli generally punishes when someone makes such mistake. He gets in a good position and whips it wide of mid-wicket for another four",Ferguson to Kohli,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,3.3,"Ferguson to Kohli, FOUR, it's raining boundaries here! It was on a fuller length and wide of off, Kohli plunges forward and times the drive incredibly well. The placement was excellent too, it beats backward point and third man. And canters to the fence",Ferguson to Kohli,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,3.5,"Ferguson to Kohli, FOUR, an on-drive with a straight bat is one of the hardest shots to play in our sport. But how insanely easy Kohli made it look. Class, sheer class! He comes on the front foot and drives it past mid-on for another four",Ferguson to Kohli,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,4.2,"Chawla to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, he wants to match Kohli, It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps. Parthiv brings his bat down early and sweeps it wide of deep backward square leg for a four. Incredible bat-speed!",Chawla to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
1415953,RCB 1st Inns,9.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Kohli, FOUR, bonus runs for RCB, exacly what they want. Very rarely, a bowler of Kuldeep's caliber delivers a morsel like this. It was down the leg-side and Kohli just helps it to the the fine-leg fence with a flick",Kuldeep Yadav to Kohli,FOUR
8616942,CSK 1st Inns,1.3,"Ashwin to Watson, FOUR, rank length, quite leg-lined too .. and Watson's quickly under it, sitting on a knee and sweeping it firmly through square leg",Ashwin to Watson,FOUR
8616942,CSK 1st Inns,14.5,"Shami to Rayudu, FOUR, pace is one thing you can't bowl on this surface. 143.2kph and Rayudu even advanced to make his own speed, makes just enough room to thump it over extra cover, Miller tried his best but the timing was good enough to beat him",Shami to Rayudu,FOUR
8616942,CSK 1st Inns,17.5,"Tye to Dhoni, FOUR, and thumped! That was a mini helicopter as he smashed a full ball down the ground past long-off for a four. The ball was full, Dhoni just gave himself a little room and smashed it",Tye to Dhoni,FOUR
8616942,CSK 1st Inns,18.4,"Sam Curran to Dhoni, FOUR, and that wasn't timed! Off the inner half of the bat and the ball escapes into the gap between deep square and deep mid for a four. Poor delivery and was put away",Sam Curran to Dhoni,FOUR
8616942,CSK 1st Inns,18.5,"Sam Curran to Dhoni, FOUR, fuller and channelling away, Dhoni lifts the ball away over cover and that is a four. One bounce into the fence. These death overs are his territory and Sam Curran is messing up his lengths as well",Sam Curran to Dhoni,FOUR
8616942,CSK 1st Inns,19.3,"Shami to Dhoni, FOUR, not the smartest of bowling from Shami. The deep fine was in and Shami bowls it short. Dhoni hangs back and pulls it over short fine leg for a four. The Chennai crowd loving every bit of it",Shami to Dhoni,FOUR
8616942,CSK 1st Inns,2.3,"Shami to du Plessis, FOUR, ah, neat. When there's no pace off the pitch, Faf decides to generate some himself. Lovely step away, step down and goes inside-out over mid-off",Shami to du Plessis,FOUR
8616942,CSK 1st Inns,2.4,"Shami to du Plessis, FOUR, another Shami outfoxing. Faf continues coming down the pitch, Shami tries pulling his length back, but then Faf is happy to wait on it, present a nice full bat face in slapping it away over point",Shami to du Plessis,FOUR
8616942,CSK 1st Inns,4.1,"Tye to Watson, FOUR, juicy. Full, easily down leg, and all Watson has to do is tickle - but he swings, middles his sweep behind square powerfully",Tye to Watson,FOUR
8616942,CSK 1st Inns,6.0,"Sam Curran to Watson, FOUR, ruins what should've been a really good over. Slips into the pads and Watson plays some sort of a half-flick, half-sweep to nail it in the gap behind square",Sam Curran to Watson,FOUR
8616942,CSK 1st Inns,9.5,"Tye to Raina, FOUR, that line was not going to work for long, especially with third man in. Angled outside off and Raina uses that smartly to steer a boundary behind point - splitting backward point and short third",Tye to Raina,FOUR
8616942,KXIP 1st Inns,0.3,"Chahar to Gayle, FOUR, prodigious movement for Chahar. Pitched up and late shape away for Chahar just outside off. Gayle goes after it, hard hands and gets a thick outside edge which eludes Bhajji at short third man",Chahar to Gayle,FOUR
8616942,KXIP 1st Inns,11.2,"Kuggeleijn to Sarfaraz Khan, FOUR, and the dilscoop! Done really well as he scooped it over the keeper's head for a one bounce four. And Sarfaraz Khan has a go at someone after playing the shot",Kuggeleijn to Sarfaraz Khan,FOUR
8616942,KXIP 1st Inns,17.5,"Kuggeleijn to Miller, FOUR, it was in the arc for Miller and he dispatched it for a boundary. Kuggeleijn after bowling brilliant slower ones decides to bowl a yorker.

8616942,KXIP 1st Inns,4.1,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR, glorious from Rahul. Indipper on a fuller length at the stumps, Rahul doesn't try to hit it too hard. Just presents a straight bat face and drives it elegantly past mid-on. His drives are a thing of beauty..",Chahar to Rahul,FOUR
8616942,KXIP 1st Inns,5.0,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR, follows it up with another loosener down leg, Rahul makes him pay again.

8616942,KXIP 1st Inns,8.0,"Tahir to Sarfaraz Khan, FOUR, poor finish to the over. Too short and too wide of off, Sarfaraz goes back and opens his bat face to lace it past point. Sweeper cover tries his best but in vain",Tahir to Sarfaraz Khan,FOUR
8616942,KXIP 1st Inns,8.2,"Jadeja to Sarfaraz Khan, FOUR, wonderfully done! Waits on it, and then dabs it away with an open face of the bat. Dhoni did spread his legs in anticipation but it nutmegged him",Jadeja to Sarfaraz Khan,FOUR
8616942,KXIP 1st Inns,8.4,"Jadeja to Rahul, FOUR, was that a punch or a cut! But was beautifully done as he used the pace of the bowler to send it away. The man at deep cover put in a clumsy dive but couldn't cut it off",Jadeja to Rahul,FOUR
4077127,MI 1st Inns,11.0,"Rashid Khan to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, and the extra delivery costs them a boundary..

4077127,MI 1st Inns,16.4,"Rashid Khan to Rahul Chahar, FOUR, oh, this is nicely done by Rahul. He's no mug with the bat. Picks the googly, waits and waits before dabbing it past slip. Has enough legs to reach the fence",Rashid Khan to Rahul Chahar,FOUR
4077127,MI 1st Inns,17.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul Chahar, FOUR, well, this is clever batting frm Rahul. He's too good with the dinks. Again picks the length delivery, gets deep in his crease and opens his bat face at the last minute to glide it past Bairtsow",Bhuvneshwar to Rahul Chahar,FOUR
4077127,MI 1st Inns,19.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Pollard, FOUR, chipped over extra cover! Fuller and wide of off, Pollard with his long levers spanks it over the in-field. It came off the cue-end but comfortably cleared the fielder",Bhuvneshwar to Pollard,FOUR
4077127,MI 1st Inns,20.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Pollard, FOUR, another blemish and it's a boundary. MI and Pollard will not mind this. Very full from Kumar, Pollard clubs it down the ground.

4077127,SRH 1st Inns,0.5,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, FOUR, crunched through cover. Shows the kind of form he's been in this tournament. Short and fraction width provided, enough for Bairstow to cash in. Getting on top of the bounce and slapping it in the gap",Behrendorff to Bairstow,FOUR

Swinging into the pads of Warner, who shuffles across and flicks it with supreme timing behind square on the leg-side. There was a fielder in the deep but had no chance of stopping that",Behrendorff to Warner,FOUR
4077127,SRH 1st Inns,2.5,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, FOUR, seems like Bairstow read the bowler's mind here. Expected the short delivery, went deep in his crease and cleared his front leg to mow it over mid-wicket. Vijay Shankar in the dug-out enjoyed that",Behrendorff to Bairstow,FOUR
4077127,SRH 1st Inns,3.0,"Behrendorff to Bairstow, FOUR, strokes it on the rise but it beats Rohit's dive at mid-off. Fullish just outside off, Bairstow hammers it hard and luckily the ball teasingly evades the MI skipper",Behrendorff to Bairstow,FOUR
4077127,SRH 1st Inns,3.2,"Rahul Chahar to Warner, FOUR, Warner latches onto it, on this occasion. Pushed through quicker on middle, Warner took some time in getting his bat down on the heave, gets it off the inner half in the pocket between short fine leg and square leg",Rahul Chahar to Warner,FOUR
4077127,SRH 1st Inns,5.4,"Rahul Chahar to Shankar, FOUR, width available that time, Shankar waits for it to spin and steers it wide of backward point for a boundary",Rahul Chahar to Shankar,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,0.4,"Southee to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, should have been stopped by Chahal there. Iyer leans ahead and times his square drive to beat the leggie's dive at point. First one of the innings for Delhi and their skipper",Southee to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,11.0,"Negi to Ingram, FOUR, too short. Ingram rocks behind, lining up well to allow the ball to do its bit and then cut it away really late past the keeper",Negi to Ingram,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,12.1,"Chahal to Ingram, FOUR, nails the sweep. Ingram gets out a big stride, and then does well to roll his wrists on the ball as he powers it away despite the slight kick up off the pitch - keeping it down and into square leg",Chahal to Ingram,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,13.0,"Chahal to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, chops the cut away off the back foot and gets it past the man at point for a four. DC are racing away towards the target. 42 needed now. Dropped it slightly short and Shreyas Iyer was quick to pounce on it",Chahal to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,14.3,"Navdeep Saini to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, fundamental error! The ball lands on the practice wickets and skids. Siraj at third man took it easy and the skid off the ground had enough pace to burst through the hands of the fielder. Shreyas Iyer picked up the short ball and slashed it for the ball to race away off the outer-half of the bat",Navdeep Saini to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,15.1,"Moeen Ali to Pant, FOUR, fetches the length ball from outside off and drags the sweep away into the on-side. The ball raced away square of the wicket on the on-side for a four. Didn't time it but had enough on it for a single",Moeen Ali to Pant,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,16.2,"Chahal to Pant, FOUR, terrible delivery and has been put away. Pant rocked back and allowed the bat flow to take over and cut it past point. The man at deep cover had no chance",Chahal to Pant,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,18.5,"Siraj to Axar, FOUR, and those are the winning runs! Stand and deliver. Length delivery decking away, Axar lifts the ball over the in-field and gets it away to the fence for a four to complete the formalities",Siraj to Axar,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,2.1,"Southee to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, that's a good shot by Shaw. Has timed the ball nicely so far. Gets one overpitched dolly on the pads and he makes sure to put it away to the deep mid-wicket fence with a flick",Southee to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,2.2,"Southee to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for the youngster. Gets one short ball down the leg side and Shaw drags it past the fielder at short fine leg. Kohli's expressions say it all, not a great line to bowl",Southee to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,2.3,"Southee to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, shawt! Width on offer and no great pace either, Prithvi Shaw reaches out for it and slaps it through cover-point. Hat-trick of boundaries for the opener",Southee to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,2.4,"Southee to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, make it four in a row. Exhibition of stroke play by Shaw. Short ball well outside off and the batsman plays an exquisite square cut. No chance of stopping that, neither for the fielder at point, nor for the fielder at third man",Southee to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,2.5,"Southee to Prithvi Shaw, leg byes, FOUR, from bad to worse. 20 runs of the over already. Short ball around leg, Prithvi Shaw tries to flick it away but the ball clips his pads instead and races away to the fine leg fence",Southee to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,4.1,"Navdeep Saini to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, doesn't matter where the field is when you're bowling full tosses. Shaw stands deep in his crease, swinging with a lot of bottom-hand to whack it straight down the ground",Navdeep Saini to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,4.4,"Navdeep Saini to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, hard slog across the line. Doesn't pick it cleanly, dragging it in the end only off the inside half of his bat .. the powerplay and Southee's chasing dive can't stop it from trickling into cow corner",Navdeep Saini to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,6.2,"Negi to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, just too easy. Strays down leg, and then refuses to turn back in. But Iyer turns on his heel, swivelling big to heave it away fine",Negi to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,7.3,"Siraj to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, 144.7kph. Damn, violence. Iyer anticipates the back of a length sitter with a lot of width outside off and backs away further to free up his hands as he slices a flashy cut into an empty backward point zone",Siraj to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,8.5,"Negi to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, continues backing away in the crease, giving his arms the free-up space and slaps, hard, through point",Negi to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
6942289,DC 1st Inns,9.5,"Moeen Ali to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, cheekily experimental. An early premeditated lapped-scoop on realizing that there's no short fine leg, and Iyer doesn't mind walking all the way across his stumps if he has to. Doesn't find the middle, but the ballooning miscue is just as good",Moeen Ali to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
6942289,RCB 1st Inns,0.5,"Ishant to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, lovely, Parthiv is the man in form for RCB, length ball on the pads, he gets inside the line and clips it over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and over the ropes",Ishant to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
6942289,RCB 1st Inns,1.1,"Chris Morris to Kohli, FOUR, edged and four, Dhawan was the fielder at wide slip - dived to his right, but the ball was just wide of him. An awkward jab from Kohli as he pushed away from his body, didn't count for the extra bounce",Chris Morris to Kohli,FOUR
6942289,RCB 1st Inns,13.4,"Ishant to Moeen Ali, FOUR, wow! Mo has just squeezed a yorker for a boundary. The only thing wrong on Ishant's part is - it was outside off, Mo bends down, opens the bat face and squeezes it past backward point",Ishant to Moeen Ali,FOUR
6942289,RCB 1st Inns,14.4,"Lamichhane to Akshdeep Nath, FOUR, cheeky! First ball and Akshdeep is down on his knee to play the paddle, uses the pace on the ball and places it fine, the lightning fast outfield took care of the rest",Lamichhane to Akshdeep Nath,FOUR
6942289,RCB 1st Inns,15.4,"Chris Morris to Akshdeep Nath, FOUR, it was boom or bust for Akshdeep with three dots, he decides it is the latter. Charges down and converts it into a full length delivery, cracks the drive past extra cover and there was no stopping that",Chris Morris to Akshdeep Nath,FOUR
6942289,RCB 1st Inns,16.2,"Lamichhane to Akshdeep Nath, FOUR, good effort by Morris, but in vain. Akshdeep Nath was down the wicket to chip this widish delivery to long-off. Morris sprints across, gets his hands to it but his knee gets stuck in the turf, hence he fails to stop it cleanly",Lamichhane to Akshdeep Nath,FOUR
6942289,RCB 1st Inns,17.2,"Rabada to Akshdeep Nath, FOUR, cheeky shot by Akshdeep! Waits for the ball to arrive, opens the bat face very late and guides it to the third man fence. With that pace, it was always going to race away to the fence",Rabada to Akshdeep Nath,FOUR
6942289,RCB 1st Inns,5.0,"Ishant to de Villiers, FOUR, lovely, more of the AB we know and love of the past - back of a length and just outside off, not a bad ball by any means, AB comes down the track, makes room and cracks it square past cover-point - Two men dived, but the ball split them expertly",Ishant to de Villiers,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,0.2,"D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn, FOUR, french-cut! Drags back the length, does Dhawal and Lynn goes ahead with a pull shot. Gets an inside edge that rockets past the stumps and races away to the fine leg fence",D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,0.5,"D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn, FOUR, second boundary of the over! Short and wide outside off, Chris Lynn reaches out for it and slaps it past the diving fielder at cover. Once it's past the ring it's always going to be a boundary with such a quick outfield",D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,1.1,"Gowtham to Narine, FOUR, easy pickings for Narine! This was a flatter delivery on the pads and the southpaw flicks it past the fielder at short fine leg, nicely placed shot that",Gowtham to Narine,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,1.4,"Gowtham to Narine, FOUR, expensive over so far... Floated around middle and leg, Narine picks it over square leg and adds four more to his tally. That's the only way he plays",Gowtham to Narine,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,1.5,"Gowtham to Narine, FOUR, another mediocre delivery by Gowtham. Drifts this one on the pads and Narine gets it over square leg with a nonchalant flick, the home crowd is loving this even though the Royals are getting belted here",Gowtham to Narine,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,13.1,"Stokes to Shubman Gill, leg byes, FOUR, the pad-tickles will do just as well. Stokes slips in radar and Gill would feel he's missed out on some free runs here, missing the glance, but his pads take it fine enough",Stokes to Shubman Gill,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,2.0,"Gowtham to Narine, FOUR, 22 runs of Gowtham's opening over! The required run rate is down to 6 within a span of 6 deliveries. Narine treks back and chips the short ball over the infield at wide mid-off",Gowtham to Narine,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Jofra Archer to Chris Lynn, FOUR, has been the Lynn and Narine show so far! Short in length and width on offer, the batsman reaches out and carves it past the fielder at square third man, four more for the right hander",Jofra Archer to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,3.2,"D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn, FOUR, can you believe this? Dhawal could have had two wickets in two deliveries, but the wicket column reads zero. Lynn had got an inside edge that richocheted on to the stumps and raced to the fine leg fence thereafter. Happened with Dhoni a couple of days back as the bails didn't move. Lynn had even started walking but according to the law he survives. His night, probably",D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,3.3,"D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn, FOUR, short and punished! Was a slower delivery and Lynn hacks it over mid-wicket. Four more to the opener who was somewhat deceived due to the lack of pace and was early in his shot",D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,5.2,"D Kulkarni to Narine, FOUR, in the air but it's in the gap too. Narine had slogged the length delivery towards cow corner but the fielders were stationed at long-on and deep mid-wicket. Neither of them could reach as the ball found the fence",D Kulkarni to Narine,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"D Kulkarni to Narine, FOUR, nothing's going right for Dhawal Kulkarni. Attempts another slower delivery and Narine bludgeons it over mid-on. Had enough elevation to clear the fielder stationed inside the ring",D Kulkarni to Narine,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,9.1,"S Midhun to Uthappa, FOUR, was a flighted ball and Uthappa got to the pitch of the ball to slam the drive past cover. Was hit well enough for the ball to race through to the fence",S Midhun to Uthappa,FOUR
2112150,KKR 1st Inns,9.3,"S Midhun to Chris Lynn, FOUR, drops the ball short and has been cut away. More of an outer-edge on the cut and that was well away from the man at slip for a four. Tripathi had no chance this time",S Midhun to Chris Lynn,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,0.4,"Chawla to Rahane, FOUR, lovely, tossed up just outside off, Rahane went down on his knee, played with the spin and swiped it over mid-wicket, one bounce and over the ropes",Chawla to Rahane,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,10.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, FOUR, edged and four. The googly with some extra bite, Smith was taken aback by the bounce and tried to withdraw his bat, but the outside edge had already been found and it raced away fine",Kuldeep Yadav to Smith,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,10.3,"Kuldeep Yadav to Buttler, FOUR, read the batsman changing his grip and fired in a quicker delivery at 107ks, Buttler still adjusted and reverse swept it past a diving Lynn at backward point. It was a tentative dive from the Australian",Kuldeep Yadav to Buttler,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,14.4,"Prasidh to Smith, FOUR, expertly played! The off-cutter on a shortish length and moreover Smith had the width, he back cuts it behind point and Narine never looked like getting to the ball",Prasidh to Smith,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,15.0,"Prasidh to Smith, FOUR, fifty for Smith. He is the key for RR if they have to get a good total. Has played himself in and now has the hang of the surface. Waits for the slower delivery, shuffles across and pulls it backward of square leg",Prasidh to Smith,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,18.3,"Prasidh to Smith, FOUR, edged and runs! Four of them. Yorkerish delivery outside off, Smith squeezes it out and the ball flies away past the dive of the keeper for a four",Prasidh to Smith,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,19.5,"Gurney to Smith, FOUR, and finally a four! Smart play from the Aussie. Was a full ball, Smith opened the bat face and placed it in the gap between short third and point",Gurney to Smith,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,2.2,"Chawla to Buttler, FOUR, lovely, the wrong 'un from Chawla, but the length is way too short, allows Buttler to go back and whip it behind square on the on-side - no one in the deep and the ball runs away to the ropes",Chawla to Buttler,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,3.2,"Prasidh to Buttler, FOUR, nicely played, Buttler was so quick in reading Prasidh's slower ball, prods across and clips it in front of square on the on-side - beats mid-wicket and runs away to the ropes",Prasidh to Buttler,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,3.3,"Prasidh to Buttler, FOUR, lovely, this is Buttler at his best, length ball outside off, he's quick to move across and then paddles it towards the vacant fine leg region, one bounce and over the ropes",Prasidh to Buttler,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,7.4,"Narine to Smith, FOUR, cracking shot, much needed for the Royals, dropped short and spinning back into the right-hander, Smith waited on it and then cut it late - beat backward point and raced away to the fence",Narine to Smith,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,8.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Buttler, FOUR, much needed boundary for Buttler. He was feeling the pressure. Waits for the flighted delivery to land and reverse sweeps it over backward point, came right off the meat as it raced away",Kuldeep Yadav to Buttler,FOUR
2112150,RR 1st Inns,8.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Smith, FOUR, shot! He picked the wrong 'un and though he was hitting against the spin, he was in complete control. Went down on his knee, rolled his wrists and broomed it to deep square leg",Kuldeep Yadav to Smith,FOUR
4297600,KXIP 1st Inns,1.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Gayle, FOUR, there he goes - the enforecer - clearing out his front leg, not quite getting hold of his rather agricultural hoick, but his biceps will do it, get it over the mid-wicket infield",Sandeep Sharma to Gayle,FOUR
4297600,KXIP 1st Inns,10.1,"S Kaul to Agarwal, FOUR, driven on the up and the length ball disappears into the deep cover fence. Climbed into the delivery and hit it on top of the bounce to get it between cover and mid-off",S Kaul to Agarwal,FOUR
4297600,KXIP 1st Inns,10.4,"S Kaul to Rahul, FOUR, picked his spot and pulled it away! Short ball, was chest high and Rahul pulled it with a lot of disdain. One bounce and into the fence. Man at deep mid had no chance",S Kaul to Rahul,FOUR
4297600,KXIP 1st Inns,12.3,"Nabi to Rahul, FOUR, deft touch from Rahul! Spotted the length of this flat delivery early and opened the bat face at the last minute to guide it past Bairstow's gloves fine of third man",Nabi to Rahul,FOUR
4297600,KXIP 1st Inns,13.0,"Nabi to Rahul, FOUR, fifty for KL Rahul! His third in his last four games. Jumps out of his crease and hacks the flat delivery wide of long-on, Manish Pandey runs across and dives but couldn't only manage a fingertip on that",Nabi to Rahul,FOUR
4297600,KXIP 1st Inns,16.4,"S Kaul to Agarwal, FOUR, thwacked from the crease. No feet. Just stand and deliver: pumps the length ball to the right of long-off and Manish Pandey does well to flick the ball back while on the move. He, however, took a brief while to regather his momentum and by that time the ball had rolled back to kiss the boundary hoardings. Unlucky!",S Kaul to Agarwal,FOUR
4297600,KXIP 1st Inns,19.4,"Nabi to Rahul, FOUR, flat and full on off, Rahul hammers it straight and got enough power to beat the diving fielder at long-off. Crowd going bonkers now",Nabi to Rahul,FOUR
4297600,KXIP 1st Inns,3.3,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, FOUR, quicker slider in the slot, and Agarwal's already taken his front leg out of the way to drill it uppishly down the ground",Rashid Khan to Agarwal,FOUR
4297600,KXIP 1st Inns,4.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, FOUR, 138.4kph. Too full, Rahul does well going inside-out with his slice over backward point .. but Kaul runs across from third man, gets the slide in as well, but probably ends up slipping with the dew, slipping all over it",Bhuvneshwar to Rahul,FOUR
4297600,KXIP 1st Inns,7.1,"Nabi to Rahul, FOUR, just doesn't give out any pace to work around with, but Rahul has enough of his own. Making some room, and going back in the crease to pile on the drag down as he slaps it damn violently through extra cover",Nabi to Rahul,FOUR
4297600,KXIP 1st Inns,8.3,"S Kaul to Rahul, FOUR, wow! That was a superb shot. High elbow in combination with a still head helps the ball to speed past the dive of the man at mid-off. Pitched up delivery and Rahul hit it on top of the bounce to thread it through",S Kaul to Rahul,FOUR
4297600,SRH 1st Inns,10.1,"Ashwin to Shankar, FOUR, finally a boundary for Hyderabad! All about timing, this shot was. A floated and full delivery and the batsman chips it straight to long-on. The fielder in the deep was a touch square, hence he couldn't cut this down",Ashwin to Shankar,FOUR
4297600,SRH 1st Inns,11.0,"Ashwin to Warner, FOUR, that's a rare loose delivery by Punjab tonight. Ashwin darts this one outside off on a shorter length and Warner makes the use of the width on offer. Reaches out for it and slices it past the fielder at point. No fielders in the deep and that shall be the second boundary of the over",Ashwin to Warner,FOUR
4297600,SRH 1st Inns,12.3,"Mujeeb to Warner, FOUR, nicely done by Davey! Premeditates and puts this straighter delivery away to the deep point fence with a well timed reverse sweep",Mujeeb to Warner,FOUR

4297600,SRH 1st Inns,16.1,"Shami to Manish Pandey, FOUR, backs away and blasts it past mid-off for a four. That was on a length, Manish Pandey backed away, created room and allowed his hands to do the needful",Shami to Manish Pandey,FOUR
4297600,SRH 1st Inns,16.3,"Shami to Warner, FOUR, backs across, gives away and swords the ball past point for a four. Much needed boundaries these for SRH. The run rate getting a facelift here. Poor length again from Shami",Shami to Warner,FOUR
4297600,SRH 1st Inns,18.1,"Sam Curran to Manish Pandey, FOUR, slower length delivery and jhas been upper steered away past the short third fielder for a four. Was preempted and despite that being a slower ball, Manish Pandey managed to usher enough pace on to the shot to get it past the fielder. Cheeky Pandey",Sam Curran to Manish Pandey,FOUR
4297600,SRH 1st Inns,19.0,"Sam Curran to Warner, FOUR, and a good ball but a bad result. Squeezed through the third man region for a four. Got bat to ball and almost an educated edge to put it fine past short third for a four. 11 off the over. 31 runs off the 3 last overs",Sam Curran to Warner,FOUR
4297600,SRH 1st Inns,19.4,"Shami to Hooda, FOUR, walks across his sticks and tickles the ball away fine. Perfect ball but Hooda managed to get enough bat on it to peel the ball away fine. Shami almost went up in an appeal before realizing that it was off the bat",Shami to Hooda,FOUR
4297600,SRH 1st Inns,19.5,"Shami to Hooda, FOUR, brilliant shot! Straight drive down the ground. Back past the bowler and it was a four. Was full and Hooda nailed it",Shami to Hooda,FOUR
4297600,SRH 1st Inns,2.0,"Mujeeb to Shankar, FOUR, overpitched and Shankar puts it away. Mujeeb overcooks the flighted delivery and offers width as well, Shankar bends his back knee and creams the drive through extra cover. He did well to pierce the crowded field",Mujeeb to Shankar,FOUR
4297600,SRH 1st Inns,5.0,"Rajpoot to Warner, FOUR, that might just ease Warner. Full and on the stumps, Warner stays back but leans forward and clips it wide of mid-on, Ashwin's dive is not good enough to stop the ball and it races away",Rajpoot to Warner,FOUR
7815415,CSK 1st Inns,0.1,"Chawla to Watson, FOUR, proper half volley. That's no hard work for Watson, just cruising through the line and drilling it through deep extra cover",Chawla to Watson,FOUR
7815415,CSK 1st Inns,10.5,"Kuldeep Yadav to du Plessis, FOUR, this was probably the first quicker one from Kuldeep Yadav, it was on a fuller length. And du Plessis goes down on his knees and slog-sweeps it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary",Kuldeep Yadav to du Plessis,FOUR
7815415,CSK 1st Inns,14.5,"Chawla to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, whatta start! Gets a flighted ball outside off and has been lifted over cover for a four. That was unexpected. First ball and he went for it",Chawla to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR

7815415,CSK 1st Inns,16.4,"Gurney to du Plessis, FOUR, waits on it and pulls it down past short fine leg for a four. Drops it short and slow, du Plessis stayed still and waited on it before pulling it past the fielder. Only 6 runs needed now",Gurney to du Plessis,FOUR
7815415,CSK 1st Inns,2.1,"Narine to Watson, FOUR, quick legs. And quicker hands. Narine starts short with an off-break spinning into leg-stump, giving Watson ample time to go deep in his crease and punch it away as he splits the two men on the off-side",Narine to Watson,FOUR
7815415,CSK 1st Inns,3.4,"Prasidh to Raina, FOUR, vintage. Typical. Backs away, makes a lot of room and slices it inside-out over cover. Timing, placement don't really get better",Prasidh to Raina,FOUR
7815415,CSK 1st Inns,5.4,"Prasidh to Rayudu, FOUR, Rayudu makes full use of the free-hit, he picks up the slower one early, gets himself in a good position and tonks it wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary. This should get him going",Prasidh to Rayudu,FOUR
7815415,CSK 1st Inns,9.5,"Gurney to Rayudu, FOUR, Gurney is guilty of providing width on this one, Rayudu delays his bat swing and cuts it wide of backward point for a boundary",Gurney to Rayudu,FOUR
7815415,KKR 1st Inns,13.5,"Kuggeleijn to A Russell, FOUR, short again and Russell pulls it in the gap this time. Backed himself, stayed deep in his crease and puts it in the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket",Kuggeleijn to A Russell,FOUR
7815415,KKR 1st Inns,14.3,"Tahir to A Russell, FOUR, that's crunched past long-off. Loopy low full toss, Russell makes a bit of room and frees his arms to slap it firmly down the ground. Long-off had no chance",Tahir to A Russell,FOUR
7815415,KKR 1st Inns,17.1,"Kuggeleijn to A Russell, FOUR, 110.2kph. Slow, short, spinning in. Russell clears out his front leg, very agriculturally in a murdering heave through mid-wicket",Kuggeleijn to A Russell,FOUR
7815415,KKR 1st Inns,19.4,"Kuggeleijn to A Russell, FOUR, another muscled heave. It couldn't have gone quicker through square leg, where Rayudu tries his best to leap up on the bounce and pull it back into play, but no, such is the momentum on this that even his palm-ricochet has the legs to roll over",Kuggeleijn to A Russell,FOUR
7815415,KKR 1st Inns,20.0,"Kuggeleijn to A Russell, FOUR, and it'll end with another. Russell - like he has been all season - continues to be the lone hand, getting under another pretty full delivery and still manages to generate a lot of bottom-handed power to drill it straight back, beating long-off as well .. 108 it will be",Kuggeleijn to A Russell,FOUR
7815415,KKR 1st Inns,3.3,"Jadeja to Karthik, FOUR, edged but doesn't carry and beats first slip! Jadeja is getting some bite off the pitch, got this to spin away sharply but Karthik did well to play with soft hands. Hence, the edge fell short of Watto and beat him as well to the fence.

2047324,KXIP 1st Inns,14.5,"Hardik Pandya to Miller, FOUR, not where he intended but it's a welcome boundary for Kings XI. Just been a bit of a lull after Gayle's dismissal.

2047324,KXIP 1st Inns,5.4,"Bumrah to Rahul, FOUR, these two compliment eachother so well. If, Gayle bludgeons the ball, Rahul just caresses it.

2047324,KXIP 1st Inns,6.3,"Alzarri Joseph to Rahul, FOUR, another terrific shot, his back leg was flying when he attempted that shot. And white cherry was flying too. Picks up the slower one quickly, delays his bat swing and lifts it over mid-off for another four",Alzarri Joseph to Rahul,FOUR

And worse, it trickled past him to the fence too. Did take a fine catch earlier and nearly had another really good catch to his name. Joseph was clearly rushed on the bumper and he managed only a top edge on the pull. Gets himself a useful boundary in the end",Shami to Alzarri Joseph,FOUR
2047324,MI 1st Inns,17.4,"Shami to Alzarri Joseph, FOUR, hammered wide of mid-off! Joseph showing that he can fetch boundaries too.

2047324,MI 1st Inns,4.4,"Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, in the slot and disappears over the bowler's head. The cameras pan on Miller, who has a clueless expression on his face. Poor delivery it was and Suryakumar Yadav muscled it down the ground",Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
2047324,MI 1st Inns,5.0,"Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, he does this so often! Uses the pace of the bowler and just dabs it fine to send the ball racing away to deep third man for a four.

7172727,MI 1st Inns,9.3,"Gowtham to Rohit, FOUR, Gowtham bowls it slightly wide of off, but Rohit is well equipped to put that away. Bends his back leg, gets underneath the ball and tonks it over the bowler's head",Gowtham to Rohit,FOUR
7172727,MI 1st Inns,9.4,"Gowtham to Rohit, FOUR, a dart at 99.8kph wide of off, Rohit throws his bat at it and slashes it through backward point. 15 off the over with two balls to go",Gowtham to Rohit,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,0.4,"Behrendorff to Rahane, FOUR, dropped by Rohit! Sharp chance but he didn't time the leap well, ended up getting a hand and it dribbled away down to the long-off fence. Was in the slot as Rahane went for the loft down the ground. Didn't get it off the middle and if not for Rohit's lapse in fielding, the RR skipper might have been on his way",Behrendorff to Rahane,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,1.3,"Alzarri Joseph to Buttler, FOUR, lifted over the infield! One of Buttler's go-to shots in the powerplay. Stands tall this time to the good length ball and carves it over cover. More off the cue-end really but he's got enuugh power to clear the field and it trickles away",Alzarri Joseph to Buttler,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,12.2,"Alzarri Joseph to Buttler, FOUR, they're taking the game away in a rush. Pitched up outside off, Buttler stands where he is, no movement of the feet and crashes it through extra cover",Alzarri Joseph to Buttler,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,12.3,"Alzarri Joseph to Buttler, FOUR, no stopping him here. Joseph's given a full toss, he's pitched one full and wide, and now he's gone for a back of a length slower ball outside off. Buttler picks it up, waits on it and cuts it through backward point",Alzarri Joseph to Buttler,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,12.4,"Alzarri Joseph to Buttler, FOUR, and even a yorker isn't spared. Reaches out for this outside off and squeezes it past the keeper. Third man was in the ring anyway",Alzarri Joseph to Buttler,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,12.5,"Alzarri Joseph to Buttler, FOUR, steers another yorker to the third man boundary. Mumbai looking absolutely clueless. Rohit claps for his bowler who's hardly faltered with his execution, but that's hardly much consolation for Alzarri Joseph",Alzarri Joseph to Buttler,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,15.1,"Krunal Pandya to Smith, FOUR, premeditates a paddle-sweep, then has to reach for it as Krunal bowls this well wide outside off, but somehow gets a top-edge over the keeper's head",Krunal Pandya to Smith,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,15.5,"Krunal Pandya to Samson, FOUR, drifting in on off and middle, Samson bends across and deflects it fine with a paddle-sweep",Krunal Pandya to Samson,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,18.5,"Bumrah to Shreyas Gopal, FOUR, flies away off the outside edge through to the third man boundary. Short of length outside off, maybe not the best option from Bumrah as it gives a slashing Gopal more than a fifty-fifty chance. He just needed to get something on it, which he did",Bumrah to Shreyas Gopal,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,19.3,"Hardik Pandya to Shreyas Gopal, FOUR, full on off, Gopal doesn't time it perfectly but manages to drive it through the gap at extra cover. Rajasthan Royals, who almost messed up the chase at the end, have been bailed out by Shreyas Gopal",Hardik Pandya to Shreyas Gopal,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,2.0,"Alzarri Joseph to Buttler, FOUR, paddlescooped just past short fine leg! Once again, Buttler hasn't got it off the middle but still has enough wood to get it past the fielder in the ring. Walked across very early, signaling his intentions to this fuller ball, had to fetch it from outside off but his brisk initial movement allowed him to do that, just",Alzarri Joseph to Buttler,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,2.1,"Behrendorff to Rahane, FOUR, not a kind of shot that you would associate with Rahane. Gets a length ball and just clears his legs to club this over mid-wicket. An agricultural hoick of sorts and it's come off",Behrendorff to Rahane,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,2.5,"Behrendorff to Rahane, FOUR, silky stroke from Jinks. Was a bad ball though, full and down leg, he just got across to glance it wide of short fine leg. The outfield here is the batsman's ally once he gets past the infield",Behrendorff to Rahane,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,4.1,"Alzarri Joseph to Rahane, FOUR, full and outside off, Rahane bends down and spoons it over the infield, there was a man at deep point but he couldn't get there in time to stop the boundary",Alzarri Joseph to Rahane,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,4.5,"Alzarri Joseph to Rahane, FOUR, now the finesse. Banged in and the ball was climing around off-stump, Rahane arches back and ramps it over de Kock, one bounce and over the ropes. Rohit looks worried!",Alzarri Joseph to Rahane,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,5.1,"Bumrah to Rahane, FOUR, welcome, Mr. Bumrah. This is Rahane at his best. Full delivery outside off, he has a good front foot stride, the high elbow and the straight bat - creams the drive textbook style through extra cover. None of the fielders moved",Bumrah to Rahane,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,5.5,"Bumrah to Buttler, FOUR, boundaries continue to flow.. Even Bumrah has conceded two in the over. A venomless short delivery that sits up for the Englishman, Buttler swivels and pulls it over the square leg umpire. No protection in the deep",Bumrah to Buttler,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,9.1,"Behrendorff to Samson, FOUR, worrying signs for Mumbai. They can't afford to leak runs from both ends. Samson holds a good shape and lofts the length delivery inside out over extra cover. A calculated shot as mid-off was inside the ring",Behrendorff to Samson,FOUR
7172727,RR 1st Inns,9.5,"Behrendorff to Buttler, FOUR, the angle works against Behrendorff. He slips on the pads and that is easy pickings, Buttler got some wood on that, the ball then deflected off the pad to the fine leg fence",Behrendorff to Buttler,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,1.4,"Navdeep Saini to Gayle, FOUR, Gayle has had enough of pushing and prodding, makes room to a good length delivery and hoicks - off the thick inside edge and past square leg, runs away to the ropes in a jiffy",Navdeep Saini to Gayle,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,10.4,"Chahal to Sarfaraz Khan, FOUR, poor delivery and Chahal knows it immediately. Drifts it way down leg and Sarfaraz helps it along the way with a bit of glove, the fast outfield takes care of the rest",Chahal to Sarfaraz Khan,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,14.4,"Chahal to Gayle, FOUR, in an attempt to keep it away from Gayle's range, Chahal sprays it down leg, the left hander gets enough bat on the glance to take the ball fine and into the fence",Chahal to Gayle,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,17.4,"Navdeep Saini to Mandeep, FOUR, timely boundary for Mandeep who has been looking to make a move on for some time now. Shortish and angling into him, was pulled away hard in front of square through the leg-side. ABD in the deep got across but probably timed the slide wrong. Ends up palming it past the ropes",Navdeep Saini to Mandeep,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,18.1,"U Yadav to Gayle, FOUR, full toss and you can't be bowling those at this stage to a well-set Gayle. He shovels it over mid-wicket, into the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on. Was more of a chip stroke and gets the boundary",U Yadav to Gayle,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,19.4,"Siraj to Gayle, FOUR, Gayle inches closer to another IPL ton. Wide full toss and there aren't many worse deliveries to bowl to a set batsman. Especially with third man in the ring. Gayle slices it away, well wide of the fielder in the ring and away she goes to the fence",Siraj to Gayle,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,2.1,"U Yadav to Gayle, FOUR, cracking shot, fraction too short from Umesh, Gayle stands tall, rolls his wrists and pulls it in front of square on the on-side, no need to run for those",U Yadav to Gayle,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,20.0,"Siraj to Gayle, FOUR, he almost did! Ends unbeaten on 99! Gayle would have wanted that one run but then, don't think he will be too worried about not getting to the milestone. Siraj missed the wide yorker marginally this time and it was sliced away, well wide of short third man and to the fence for a boundary. Gayle is only the second batsman to end on 99 not out in the IPL after Raina",Siraj to Gayle,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,4.0,"Navdeep Saini to Gayle, FOUR, that has been muscled away, think he didn't get it off the middle of the bat, but almost sent the ball over the ropes - backed away to a length ball and went over the bowler's head",Navdeep Saini to Gayle,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,4.1,"U Yadav to Rahul, FOUR, that's easy pickings for an in-form batsman, leg-stump half-volley and Rahul whips it away behind square on the on-side for a boundary",U Yadav to Rahul,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,4.2,"U Yadav to Rahul, FOUR, that's some timing from KL, length ball at the stumps, Rahul leant forward and played a one-handed on-drive - was in the air for a while but rushed past the diving fielder at mid-on",U Yadav to Rahul,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,5.1,"Siraj to Gayle, FOUR, that's some way to welcome Siraj to the crease, length ball outside off, Gayle backs away and drills it through the line, one bounce and over the ropes at long-off",Siraj to Gayle,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,5.3,"Siraj to Gayle, FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries, short of a length and well outside off, Gayle leans across and cuts it in front of square on the off-side, past AB at cover and runs away to the ropes",Siraj to Gayle,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,6.0,"Siraj to Gayle, FOUR, make that 24 off the over, length ball on the pads and it's flicked away disdainfully past short fine. RCB need time to breathe and they call for a strategic break",Siraj to Gayle,FOUR
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,7.5,"Moeen Ali to Agarwal, FOUR, cheeky and four, tossed up well outside off, Mayank bent down low, used the pace on the ball and lapped it fine, fine leg is very square and has no chance",Moeen Ali to Agarwal,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,0.1,"Sam Curran to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, classy shot from Parthiv! Curran provides a floaty half volley and it's creamed through the gap at cover. Lovely timing and it raced away. RCB are away in style",Sam Curran to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,1.1,"Shami to Kohli, FOUR, the signature Kohli straight drive! Like Curran, Shami also starts with a half volley. The RCB skipper leans forward and strokes it past the bowler and beats the diving mid-off fielder",Shami to Kohli,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,1.2,"Shami to Kohli, FOUR, Kohli is off the blocks in a jiffy. Not that bad a ball, just a superb shot. Was on a length around off, he shuffled across and clipped it away sweetly through mid-wicket. Once again, outstanding timing on the shot. Nothing much you can do as a bowler except applaud the batsman",Shami to Kohli,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,1.4,"Shami to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, heaved away! The length is wrong from Shami this time, gives one in the slot for Parthiv who is ready to throw his bat at anything that's within his reach. Clubs it through mid-wicket",Shami to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,10.1,"Ashwin to Kohli, FOUR, the partnership between Kohli and de Villiers is now 50. Slow through the air - 81.6kph, Kohli cuts off the back foot and Shami at backward point is too slow to bend down to his right. Doesn't get a hand on it and the ball reaches the fence in a jiffy. Ashwin isn't happy with that effort",Ashwin to Kohli,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,11.3,"Tye to Kohli, FOUR, wayward ball. Slips it down leg and Kohli clips it square of the man at short fine leg. Easily put away",Tye to Kohli,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,12.5,"Sam Curran to de Villiers, FOUR, plants his back knee across off stump and swipes this slower ball over short fine leg. Almost went for six, just the one bounce",Sam Curran to de Villiers,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,17.1,"Tye to Stoinis, FOUR, nicely whipped away by Stoinis. He's timed it beautifully, although Tye did much of the work for him by giving a gentle full ball on the pads. And then Stoinis gratefully picked it up backward of square, past fine leg",Tye to Stoinis,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,17.2,"Tye to Stoinis, FOUR, short of length delivery wide of off, it's a slower ball but on this pitch, it has come on so brilliantly onto the bat. Stoinis has just opened the face, that's it, but it's sped away through backward point",Tye to Stoinis,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,18.4,"Shami to Stoinis, FOUR, this won't please Ashwin one bit. Having called mid-off inside the ring, Shami bowls a low full toss and is tonked straight back over that fielder. Another chat",Shami to Stoinis,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,19.1,"Sarfaraz Khan to Stoinis, FOUR, drops it down short and is smoked back down the ground. Slapped to the fence for four",Sarfaraz Khan to Stoinis,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,2.1,"Sam Curran to Kohli, FOUR, ominous signs for KXIP because Kohli is timing them sweet and crisp. Not that full in length but he is well forward and punches it on the up. Beats the diving mid-off fielder and it's sped away to the fence",Sam Curran to Kohli,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,2.5,"Sam Curran to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, raining boundaries in the Powerplay. Just the kind of start RCB were looking for. Too full from Curran and it's hammered straight back past him and down the ground. Mid-off had no chance",Sam Curran to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,3.0,"Sam Curran to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, Curran is spraying them all around. Shortish this time but at a gentle pace and leg stumpish, Parthiv just had to beat short fine leg to get a boundary. He ends up clearing that fielder comfortably with a half-pull",Sam Curran to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,3.3,"Ashwin to Kohli, FOUR, smacked straight back past the bowler! Those famous wrists of Kohli and although it was aerial, Ashwin had no chance. Was a float up that got drilled mercilessly down the ground. Rocketed to the fence",Ashwin to Kohli,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,4.2,"Shami to de Villiers, FOUR, AB de Villiers is underway! Seam-up ball, the length is on the shorter side and de Villiers is quick to pounce on it. Jumps on the back foot and punches it wide of mid-off beating the fielder to his left. Excellent placement",Shami to de Villiers,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,4.4,"Shami to de Villiers, FOUR, nicely done! Good length, seam-up delivery, marginally outside off, de Villiers opens his bat-face at the last moment and runs it very fine to the third man fence. Used the bowler's pace to good effect",Shami to de Villiers,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,5.4,"Murugan Ashwin to Kohli, FOUR, too wide from Murugan Ashwin and Kohli punishes. Camps back and cuts it in the direction of the turn. Beats point and races away to the fence",Murugan Ashwin to Kohli,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,5.5,"Murugan Ashwin to Kohli, FOUR, four more! A desperate dive to his left in the deep from Mayank, but in vain. A length ball and Kohli walked across towards off to clip it away through mid-wicket using those mighty wrists. Agarwal got a hand to it, but couldn't stop the ball from going past the ropes",Murugan Ashwin to Kohli,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,7.0,"Tye to de Villiers, FOUR, de Villiers has no trouble this time. Slow, short and wide outside off. AB jumps and slaps it up and over extra cover. Easily done",Tye to de Villiers,FOUR
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,9.1,"Murugan Ashwin to de Villiers, FOUR, sloppy, slippy! KL Rahul, the culprit. de Villiers drove this flighted delivery all along the ground to the left of long-off. There was no need to slide, but KL does that and over-does - courtesy dew? In the end, he could only watch the ball go past the ropes",Murugan Ashwin to de Villiers,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,0.1,"Prasidh to Watson, FOUR, and that's a fine start for CSK! Fuller delivery and has been on-driven down the ground. The full face of the bat showcased and the ball sped away",Prasidh to Watson,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,0.3,"Prasidh to du Plessis, FOUR, fuller ball on the pads and clipped away past the square leg umpire for a four. Poor from Prasidh. Too full and put away off the pads",Prasidh to du Plessis,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,10.5,"Kuldeep Yadav to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, rank long hop and Jadhav takes full toll. Kuldeep Yadav knows it was a bad delivery and he's disappointed with himself.

3993413,CSK 1st Inns,13.2,"Chawla to Raina, FOUR, this time he knows exactly what Chawla has bowled. Picks the googly, steps away from the line and opens the face on his cut past backward point",Chawla to Raina,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,14.4,"Gurney to Raina, FOUR, that's a shocking delivery. A full toss on the pads from round the wicket, that too with fine leg in. Raina can't believe his luck as he glances it to the fence",Gurney to Raina,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,16.5,"Prasidh to Jadeja, FOUR, now that's been struck extremely sweetly. Full ball around off, Jadeja gets the front leg out of the way and nails the drive straight of mid-off",Prasidh to Jadeja,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,17.2,"Narine to Raina, FOUR, what a bonus for CSK. Don't think they're looking to attack Narine, but he himself has presented a half-tracker. Raina happily belts the pull wide of long-on",Narine to Raina,FOUR

3993413,CSK 1st Inns,18.3,"Gurney to Jadeja, FOUR, pitched up on middle, Jadeja swipes right across the line of it, and it somehow balloons off his leading edge over backward point. Third man was inside the ring, so it runs away for four. Back-to-back boundaries for Jadeja",Gurney to Jadeja,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,18.4,"Gurney to Jadeja, FOUR, really poor from Gurney, who switched to round the wicket and delivered a low full toss on the pads with fine leg inside the ring. The second time he's done that tonight. Easy put away for Jadeja",Gurney to Jadeja,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,19.1,"Chawla to Jadeja, FOUR, 120kph, seam up delivery that's short and wide outside off. Definitely surprised Jadeja who was late on it, but he managed to get it off the toe-edge. The pace on the ball did the rest as it raced past a helpless short third man",Chawla to Jadeja,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,2.2,"A Russell to du Plessis, FOUR, short ball, bad ball and has been put away. Swivelled on the back leg and pulled it in front of square for a four",A Russell to du Plessis,FOUR

3993413,CSK 1st Inns,2.4,"A Russell to du Plessis, FOUR, the short ball ain't working here. Walks across his sticks and scoops it fine on the on-side for a four. Third four in succession",A Russell to du Plessis,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,2.5,"A Russell to du Plessis, FOUR, Russell getting a taste of his own medicine. That was a slower delivery and du Plessis walked across his sticks again and scooped it fine. The short fine fielder had no chance",A Russell to du Plessis,FOUR

3993413,CSK 1st Inns,4.3,"Prasidh to Raina, FOUR, that's a buffet ball from Krishna. Sends a length delivery down leg, easy pickings for Raina as he gently shuffles across and helps it very fine. Fine leg was inside the ring and just watched the ball elude to his left",Prasidh to Raina,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,5.0,"Prasidh to Raina, FOUR, oh, this is wayward stuff from Krishna. Another loosener down leg and Raina tucks in the gift. Moves across, allows for the ball to arrive and glances it past short fine leg",Prasidh to Raina,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,7.5,"Narine to Raina, FOUR, that's a horror delivery from Narine. Slips it down leg, too easy for Raina as he bends low and sweeps it very fine, earns himself a boundary",Narine to Raina,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,9.4,"Chawla to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, Jadhav picks the googly and lifts it over extra cover. High percentage shot against spin. Waited for the ball to arrive, lunges forward and cashes in with a nonchalant loft. All grace from Jadhav",Chawla to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,9.5,"Chawla to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, now the cheekiness. How smart is Jadhav here? Nothing wrong with the delivery from Chawla, it was flighted delivery just outside off but KJ cleverly went deep in his crease and opened his bat face at the last moment to guide it past short third man. The fielder gave a long chase but the ball wins the race",Chawla to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
3993413,KKR 1st Inns,0.4,"Chahar to Chris Lynn, FOUR, 1000 runs for Lynn in IPL! Wide-ish delivery in the channel outside off, very close to tramline, Lynn gets down on his knee and smacks it over covers, one bounce and into the fence she goes",Chahar to Chris Lynn,FOUR
3993413,KKR 1st Inns,0.5,"Chahar to Chris Lynn, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for the opener! This was slightly short in the channel outside off, Chris Lynn treks back and slaps it wide of the fielder at sweeper cover, great timing and power on that",Chahar to Chris Lynn,FOUR

3993413,KKR 1st Inns,14.2,"Tahir to A Russell, FOUR, .. and he's off and running with a boundary - tossed up on the leg-stump line, Russell gets forward and thumps it wide of mid-wicket - no one in the deep to stop that",Tahir to A Russell,FOUR

3993413,KKR 1st Inns,2.1,"Chahar to Chris Lynn, FOUR, that's in the air but it's wide of the fielder at deep mid-wicket. Lynn latches on to the short ball and hacks it over mid-wicket.

3993413,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Chahar to Chris Lynn, FOUR, drilled through extra cover! Pitched on a full length and Lynn creams it past the fielder at wide mid-off. Pressure on the bowler, 14 runs of the over already. Still 3 balls to go!",Chahar to Chris Lynn,FOUR

3993413,KKR 1st Inns,4.0,"SN Thakur to Chris Lynn, FOUR, looks a belter of a wicket this one. Just look at the timing on that. Minimum effort, maximum result.

3993413,KKR 1st Inns,5.3,"Jadeja to Nitish Rana, FOUR, good move by DK to send Rana at number 3. With two left arm spinners in CSK, he can get a few handy runs. This was wide outside off and Rana slaps it wide of the fielder at cover, placement was the key on this occasion",Jadeja to Nitish Rana,FOUR
3993413,KKR 1st Inns,5.5,"Jadeja to Chris Lynn, FOUR, Lynn is looking in good touch today! Intent in his gameplay. This was short and wide outside off, the opener makes use of the width on offer and thrashes it past the man at cover",Jadeja to Chris Lynn,FOUR
3993413,KKR 1st Inns,7.4,"Jadeja to Nitish Rana, FOUR, excellent square cut by Rana! This was another short ball and well outside off, Rana sees the opportunity there and cuts it very late, past the fielder at backward point and that's four more",Jadeja to Nitish Rana,FOUR

5013362,DC 1st Inns,0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan, FOUR, oh outside edge and it's flew past the man at slip. Outswinger from a good length, Dhawan tries to defend, gets a thick edge and gets away with it",Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan,FOUR
5013362,DC 1st Inns,11.0,"Shankar to Pant, FOUR, another edge and Pant escapes this time. Hands on the head for SRH's fielders. It was pitched up outside off, Pant's eyes light up as he goes hard on the drive. No feet, just hands following the ball.

5013362,DC 1st Inns,12.0,"Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, smacked over mid-wicket. Rare loose ball from Rashid, a rank long hop and Iyer was so quick to read it. Hangs back and places it supremely in the gap",Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
5013362,DC 1st Inns,12.4,"Sandeep Sharma to Pant, FOUR, oh, poor Rashid. The ball's following him and this time he fails to stop it. Should have done better definitely because the standards he sets in the field is amazing. Shortish from Sharma, well outside off. Pant gets deep and cuts it past point. Rashid did cover good ground but ended up letting it away to the fence at sweeper cover",Sandeep Sharma to Pant,FOUR
5013362,DC 1st Inns,18.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Axar, FOUR, finally a boundary for Delhi! It has come after ages. A wide full toss by Sandeep and Axar makes sure it's sent to the boundary. Reaches out for it and slaps it past the man at cover, also manages to beat the sprinter in the deep",Sandeep Sharma to Axar,FOUR
5013362,DC 1st Inns,2.2,"Sandeep Sharma to Munro, FOUR, a man at slip would have swallowed that. Outswinger outside off stump, Munro slashes hard, gets a thick edge and escapes",Sandeep Sharma to Munro,FOUR
5013362,DC 1st Inns,2.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Munro, FOUR, driven hard into the square and it bounces to the right of the man at cover, Rashid tries to hunt it down, but can't cut it off in time, he flicked the ball but it touched the rope",Sandeep Sharma to Munro,FOUR
5013362,DC 1st Inns,3.4,"Khaleel Ahmed to Munro, FOUR, fullish and swinging away outside off stump, Munro stays in the crease and cuts hard, through cover-point and it races away for four",Khaleel Ahmed to Munro,FOUR
5013362,DC 1st Inns,5.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, outside edge and it's escaped past the diving man at slip, fullish delivery outside off stump, Iyer plays inside the line and tries to push at the ball, gets away with it",Bhuvneshwar to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
5013362,DC 1st Inns,5.5,"Khaleel Ahmed to Munro, FOUR, oh good bouncer but Munro has managed to top edge this fine to the fine leg boundary, smiles at the bowler acknowledging that it was a good ball",Khaleel Ahmed to Munro,FOUR
5013362,DC 1st Inns,6.4,"Hooda to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, how did he cut a ball that wasn't short! Iyer gave himself room and sliced the ball square past backward point, Ricky Bhui couldn't cut it off",Hooda to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
5013362,DC 1st Inns,8.3,"Shankar to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, wow! Surgical precision from Iyer. Two fielders dived but in vain. Juicy half-volley from Shankar, Iyer gets his front foot across and nails the drive fabulously through extra cover",Shankar to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
5013362,DC 1st Inns,9.1,"Rashid Khan to Pant, FOUR, Pant greets Rashid to the attack with a boundary. Not the ideal start as he drops it short, Pant rocks back quickly and swats it in front of square on the leg-side. Threads the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket to perfection",Rashid Khan to Pant,FOUR
5013362,DC 1st Inns,9.4,"Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, edged and flies past slip. Steaky but Iyer won't mind. Loopy delivery, almost a yorker length outside off. Iyer squeezes it and gets a healthy outside edge which eludes slip and beats short third man as well",Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
5013362,SRH 1st Inns,1.1,"Rabada to Warner, FOUR, welcome into the attack Mr. Rabada! Back of a length delivery at 150kph, Warner swings hard and gets it off the inside edge through square leg. No fielders stationed in that region and that shall be the first boundary of the innings",Rabada to Warner,FOUR
5013362,SRH 1st Inns,1.5,"Rabada to Bairstow, FOUR, not a great line by Rabada! Short ball at the hips and Bairstow glances it past the fielder at short fine leg with nonchalance. All he had to is get some bat on it, which he does. The pace at which Rabada is bowling makes it easy to take it away to the fence",Rabada to Bairstow,FOUR
5013362,SRH 1st Inns,13.1,"Chris Morris to Warner, FOUR, takes strike after sometime but that doesn't deter him from getting a four. Jumped on to the short ball and pulled it away towards deep mid for a four. Played it in front of square and got it in the gap",Chris Morris to Warner,FOUR
5013362,SRH 1st Inns,13.5,"Chris Morris to Warner, FOUR, gift of a delivery. A full toss. And Warner laces that by backing away. Crunched it past cover for a four. Important four",Chris Morris to Warner,FOUR
5013362,SRH 1st Inns,2.3,"Ishant to Bairstow, FOUR, Bairstow knows only way! The aggressive way. Sees the width on offer and slices the shortish delivery over point. Enough wood on it as the ball races away to the boundary",Ishant to Bairstow,FOUR
5013362,SRH 1st Inns,2.4,"Ishant to Bairstow, FOUR, successive boundaries for the Englishman. This was on his pads and Bairstow flicks it wristily over square leg. Very VVS-esque shot that and it's four more for the opener",Ishant to Bairstow,FOUR
5013362,SRH 1st Inns,6.4,"Axar to Bairstow, FOUR, slightly short, Bairstow quickly responds by jumping back on the cut. But it's not really that short. So he's not in control, gets a thick outside edge and it runs away through the vacant slip region",Axar to Bairstow,FOUR
5013362,SRH 1st Inns,8.4,"Axar to Bairstow, FOUR, only slightly short, not a lot, but Bairstow has gone so far back in the crease, using the depth of it superbly. He's manufactured this pull shot through midwicket, and then succeeds in beating deep midwicket too",Axar to Bairstow,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,0.4,"U Yadav to de Kock, FOUR, bottom-handed whip and it finds the gap between mid-wicket and mid-on for a four. On a length, de Kock swipes across the line and gets it into the gap for it to dribble away",U Yadav to de Kock,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,0.5,"U Yadav to de Kock, FOUR, poor channel from Umesh, slips it down leg and de Kock swivels on the back foot to pull it fine for a four. Was a gift of a delivery from Umesh",U Yadav to de Kock,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,11.0,"Chahal to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, smartly played by Krunal Pandya! Gets down on one knee and paddles the full legbreak in the gap through short fine, Siraj puts in a dive after a long sprint but ball wins the race",Chahal to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,12.2,"Chahal to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, gets as low as he can, picks the flighted delivery from outside off and swipes it over square leg for his first boundary",Chahal to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,14.2,"Negi to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, why bowl a short quick ball when the flighted deliveries are doing the job for you. Surya stays back, lets the ball come and cuts to the right of short third man",Negi to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,16.1,"Navdeep Saini to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, I have no idea how Hardik has cut this all the way towards widish third man. Short ball yes, but looked like Hardik was slightly late on the shot, but he actually middled it, just fell an inch inside the rope, poor start to the over for RCB",Navdeep Saini to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,17.0,"Navdeep Saini to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, in the airrr, Southee was at mid-on, runs back but only manages to fingertip it to the boundary. Clever batting from Hardik, he lofted that deliberately in the air knowing there was no one in the deep, Navdeep Saini bowled very full this time and paid the price. Hardik went back and across for this ball, he went so deep in his crease that he would have been out hit wicket had he been in line with the stumps",Navdeep Saini to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,17.2,"Siraj to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, don't understand this field. Mid-off in at this stage to a player who loves lofting the ball straight. Siraj dishes out a full ball and Pandya happily powers it over the bowler's head",Siraj to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,18.3,"Negi to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, is that the game already! Poor short ball wide outside off stump, Pandya slaps it hard and splits long-off and deep mid-wicket to perfection",Negi to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,18.4,"Negi to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, Hardik Pandya has killed the game. Or should I say Negi? Why dart the ball when it's turning! Pandya slogs and hits it well enough and wide of long-on",Negi to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,2.1,"U Yadav to de Kock, FOUR, fuller ball and has been laced off the front foot past cover for a four. Fuller, wider and de Kock got enough bat on it to send it away into the gap",U Yadav to de Kock,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,2.3,"U Yadav to de Kock, FOUR, and off the outer edge. Toe-end may be. Cruel game for the bowlers. Length delivery outside off, de Kock looks to mow it across the line and gets it off the edge",U Yadav to de Kock,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,4.0,"Siraj to Rohit, FOUR, this is pick your spot bowling from Siraj. Short delivery outside off, pleading to be hit and Rohit slaps it over cover. MI are off to a flier",Siraj to Rohit,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,4.4,"Chahal to de Kock, FOUR, sits down on one knee, picks the length early and swipes it over square leg with sheer timing",Chahal to de Kock,FOUR
8556956,MI 1st Inns,5.2,"Navdeep Saini to Rohit, FOUR, in the slot for Rohit Sharma! Full and plenty of width outside off, Rohit lashes on it with a crunchy drive through extra cover, superbly timed!",Navdeep Saini to Rohit,FOUR
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,0.3,"Behrendorff to Kohli, FOUR, stylish shot to get off the mark! A tad too straight in line, full as well and Kohli wrists it away past the diving forward square leg fielder. Timed it sweetly",Behrendorff to Kohli,FOUR
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,13.2,"Rahul Chahar to de Villiers, FOUR, de Villiers brings out the innovation. Spotted the leg-break early, gets low and reverse-sweeps it past short third man. Brilliant!",Rahul Chahar to de Villiers,FOUR
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,15.3,"Behrendorff to Moeen Ali, FOUR, slapped through extra cover. Behrendorff goes full, overpitches it in the process just outside off. Ali stays deep and creams it hard, beats a desperate dive from Chahar at sweeper cover. Flawless timing from Ali",Behrendorff to Moeen Ali,FOUR
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,18.2,"Bumrah to de Villiers, FOUR, misses the yorker, not by much and de Villiers was quick to squeeze the ball between mid-off and cover for a four. Genius on show",Bumrah to de Villiers,FOUR
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,18.3,"Bumrah to de Villiers, FOUR, again Bumrah misses the yorker and de Villiers shows his wizardry. Gets deep, opens the bat face and pile drives the ball past cover for a four. Superb from Mr. 360",Bumrah to de Villiers,FOUR
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,2.4,"Behrendorff to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, just clears mid-on! Was a miscued lofted flick from Parthiv who saw the length full and tried his luck. Wasn't off the middle of the blade, yet managed to get it past the leaping fielder in the circle",Behrendorff to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,4.1,"Behrendorff to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, slapped over mid-wicket! Fractionally short and Parthiv picked the length early, didn't bother going back as he pulled this comfortably over mid-wicket. Clean strike",Behrendorff to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,4.4,"Behrendorff to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, deft touch this time from Parthiv! Uses the pace of Behrendorff and steers it with an open bat face. Splits the slip and gully fielder to pick up a boundary. Smart batting",Behrendorff to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,4.5,"Behrendorff to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, more runs! This is a good counterattack from Parthiv. Not in control this time as he goes for a flashy drive, slices it wide of the slip and once again, it's wide of gully and races away to the fence",Behrendorff to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,5.4,"Bumrah to de Villiers, FOUR, clubbed over point! First confident shot from de Villiers for the night. Short and wide, he stands tall and bashes it square through the off-side. Didn't connect cleanly enough but had enough wood to clear the infield with ease",Bumrah to de Villiers,FOUR
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,7.3,"Rahul Chahar to de Villiers, FOUR, cheeky from ABD! The reverse paddle and it's actually risky with a slip in place but the South African connects fairly well. Well wide of backward point to get a boundary",Rahul Chahar to de Villiers,FOUR
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,8.3,"Hardik Pandya to de Villiers, FOUR, french-cut from de Villiers and it almost shaved the off-stump. Nervy times for the South African these. This good length delivery nipped in a bit and de Villiers was cramped for room as he went for the cut - too close for comfort. Thick inside edge goes teasingly past the stumps to the fine leg fence",Hardik Pandya to de Villiers,FOUR
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,11.2,"Unadkat to Rahul, FOUR, first boundary for the opener has come in the 12th over! Rahul makes room for himself, shimmies down the wicket and lifts the shortish delivery over mid-off. The fielder was inside the circle and all he needed was to clear him, which he does. A sigh of relief for KL",Unadkat to Rahul,FOUR
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,12.2,"Shreyas Gopal to Miller, FOUR, finally a boundary for Miller! He was trying to find this gap since quite some time. Goes down on his knee and finds the fence with a nicely timed sweep shot, first one of the innings for him",Shreyas Gopal to Miller,FOUR
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,14.1,"Unadkat to Rahul, FOUR, time for the Rahul show! Goes down on his knee and scoops the length delivery over fine leg. The fielder was inside the circle and the opener clears him comfortably. That almost went the distance",Unadkat to Rahul,FOUR
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,16.3,"Jofra Archer to Rahul, FOUR, super shot! Saw the length slightly short and though there wasn't room, he created some by backing away and punched it sweetly wide of the mid-off fielder. Raced away to the fence. Another 50 for Rahul this season! This has been brilliantly paced, was really slow to begin with but is shifting gears with ease now",Jofra Archer to Rahul,FOUR
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,18.0,"Unadkat to Miller, FOUR, launched over extra cover! Spoils an otherwise good Unadkat over. A trifle too full and a bit of width as well, Miller stood still and lifted it easily over the infield. Clean strike",Unadkat to Miller,FOUR
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,19.2,"D Kulkarni to Ashwin, FOUR, useful boundary for KXIP! Width on offer and shortish as well, Ashwin was waiting for any room to be provided and sliced it away wide of backward point. Third man had no chance of cutting it off",D Kulkarni to Ashwin,FOUR
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,2.5,"D Kulkarni to Gayle, FOUR, this is erratic from Kulkarni. Serves up a low full toss outside off, Gayle reaches out and throws his bat. Gets a thick outside edge but the third man is inside the ring and it beats the fielder at 45 before running away to the fence",D Kulkarni to Gayle,FOUR
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,4.4,"D Kulkarni to Gayle, FOUR, very predictable from Kulkarni. He's bowling an array of slower balls, Gayle anticipated it and made room to spank it in the pocket between short third man and backward point",D Kulkarni to Gayle,FOUR
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,5.3,"Jofra Archer to Gayle, byes, FOUR, messy. Archer is fuming as Samson fumbles behind. Can't blame him much because he got an iffy bounce. Off-pace delivery, snaked away sharply outside off. The keeper couldn't get his body behind the line and it runs away to the boundary",Jofra Archer to Gayle,FOUR
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,7.3,"Shreyas Gopal to Agarwal, FOUR, what a shot. Gopal drags it short, Agarwal is extremely quick to read the length. Pivots back and hammers it through mid-wicket. Stuart Binny from the deep sprints across and dives, but ends up parrying it to the boundary",Shreyas Gopal to Agarwal,FOUR
9956095,RR 1st Inns,12.1,"Shami to Rahane, FOUR, great timing from Rahane as he whips this delivery backward of square. Back of a length on middle and leg, Rahane climbs onto it. A boundary at the start of his innings",Shami to Rahane,FOUR
9956095,RR 1st Inns,12.3,"Shami to R Tripathi, FOUR, poor from Shami. Bowls a hit-me on leg-stump and Tripathi tickles away neatly in the gap between deep square and fine leg",Shami to R Tripathi,FOUR
9956095,RR 1st Inns,17.3,"Shami to Binny, FOUR, Binny's off the mark with a boundary! A gentle short delivery on the stumps, Binny waits on the back foot and pummels it over mid-wicket with brute power",Shami to Binny,FOUR
9956095,RR 1st Inns,2.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Buttler, FOUR, another beautiful shot! Buttler is turning it on. Sees width on offer and just eases it through backward point. Just relied on timing and boy, didn't he time the pants off this one! Sweeper tried hard but was never chasing it down",Arshdeep Singh to Buttler,FOUR
9956095,RR 1st Inns,20.0,"Shami to Binny, FOUR, KXIP - 2, RR - 0 this season! A comfortable victory for the home team, win by 12 runs. Binny sliced the full ball one-handed and managed to get it over extra cover, Mayank Agarwal chases the ball to his left but he couldn't arrest him momentum and ended up sliding over the ball",Shami to Binny,FOUR
9956095,RR 1st Inns,4.4,"Arshdeep Singh to R Tripathi, FOUR, full and wide, Tripathi grounds his back knee and carves it up and over backward point. Beautiful shot",Arshdeep Singh to R Tripathi,FOUR
9956095,RR 1st Inns,5.0,"Arshdeep Singh to R Tripathi, FOUR, that's gone through Shami's hands at short third man. Poor effort. Length ball outside off, the angle induced the error from Tripathi as he drove away from the body. Went quickly off the outside edge to Shami's left, should've been comfortably stopped",Arshdeep Singh to R Tripathi,FOUR
9956095,RR 1st Inns,6.4,"Murugan Ashwin to R Tripathi, FOUR, uses the pace superbly. Murugan was mostly flat through the over, so Tripathi anticipated a similar trajectory, stayed back to the ball and then dabbed it fine",Murugan Ashwin to R Tripathi,FOUR
9956095,RR 1st Inns,8.3,"Shami to Samson, FOUR, it's been helped away quite fine from Samson, capitalizing superbly on just a bit of misdirection from Shami who strayed ever so slightly on middle and leg",Shami to Samson,FOUR
9956095,RR 1st Inns,8.4,"Shami to Samson, FOUR, now this is class batting. He's chopped a ball - that was on off stump - and sent it really fine into the third man boundary. What makes it an even better shot is that it was the off-cutter from Shami, so it's not as if he had a lot of pace to work with",Shami to Samson,FOUR
5962210,CSK 1st Inns,11.4,"Rashid Khan to Raina, FOUR, risky shot and he gets a boundary! Expects the googly and jumps deep inside the crease, plays the cut at the last instant and the edge flies wide of Warner at slip",Rashid Khan to Raina,FOUR
5962210,CSK 1st Inns,12.2,"Shankar to Raina, FOUR, streaky! A full throttle cross bat swing against a length delivery and Raina sends a huge chunk of top-edge on that, one bounce and over the ropes at third man",Shankar to Raina,FOUR
5962210,CSK 1st Inns,16.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Rayudu, FOUR, slower ball again but Rayudu has second guessed Sandeep Sharma there. Waited deep inside the crease and pounced on the width to flay it behind backward point",Sandeep Sharma to Rayudu,FOUR
5962210,CSK 1st Inns,17.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu, FOUR, slower ball outside off, there was enough width for Rayudu to free his arms and he does so by slapping this through backward point",Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu,FOUR
5962210,CSK 1st Inns,2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, FOUR, that shall release some pressure. Watson throws his hands at a wide-ish delivery as a thick outside edge is induced. It flies over Warner at slip and races away to the third man boundary. First one of the night for CSK!",Bhuvneshwar to Watson,FOUR
5962210,CSK 1st Inns,3.2,"Khaleel Ahmed to du Plessis, FOUR, Faf breaks the shackles! Stays put in the crease and lifts the length delivery right over the bowler's head. Can't keep a fielder there and that's a four for the South African, his first one",Khaleel Ahmed to du Plessis,FOUR
5962210,CSK 1st Inns,4.2,"Sandeep Sharma to du Plessis, FOUR, CSK are either scoring in boundaries or not at all. This one was a loosener on the pads and du Plessis clips it past Khaleel at short fine leg. Although the pacer puts in a dive, he finds it difficult to get his hand to it, all the way to the fence she goes",Sandeep Sharma to du Plessis,FOUR
5962210,CSK 1st Inns,4.4,"Sandeep Sharma to Watson, FOUR, that shall give him some confidence. A booster! This was an overpitched delivery by Sandy and Watto caresses it through extra-cover. Beats Williamson who was stationed inside the circle and sends it away to the boundary",Sandeep Sharma to Watson,FOUR
5962210,CSK 1st Inns,5.4,"Khaleel Ahmed to du Plessis, FOUR, shouldn't have given him the third over. Khaleel is become a touch predictable now. Overcompensates by going too full outside off, du Plessis creams it through covers for an elegant boundary",Khaleel Ahmed to du Plessis,FOUR
5962210,CSK 1st Inns,6.5,"Nadeem to Watson, FOUR, both batsmen are dealing in boundaries now. They've got a hang of the wicket. Watson backs away and slices the shortish delivery past the fielder at point, four runs for the Aussie international",Nadeem to Watson,FOUR
5962210,CSK 1st Inns,7.1,"Rashid Khan to Watson, FOUR, welcome into the attack, Mr Rashid. Watson goes down on his knee and sweeps the floated delivery with all his might. So much power in that shot, four more for CSK",Rashid Khan to Watson,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,0.2,"Chahar to Bairstow, FOUR, the timing off the very first ball, it's like he's turned up after an hour's batting in the nets. Fuller than a length on middle and leg, some shape for Chahar but Bairstow whips it with such class through square leg",Chahar to Bairstow,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,1.1,"SN Thakur to Bairstow, FOUR, full ball on off, drilled into the pitch and bounces over Thakur's head before racing away to the ropes",SN Thakur to Bairstow,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,1.3,"SN Thakur to Warner, FOUR, right off the toe-end from Warner as he slashes at a wide length ball. Balloons over backward point, and beats a stiff effort from Tahir at third man as he couldn't bend down enough to cut it off",SN Thakur to Warner,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,16.3,"Karn Sharma to Hooda, FOUR, proper slice. He steps down, steps away and makes the length right into his slot to carve it away with a lot of bottom hand -- into that one-shot distance now ..",Karn Sharma to Hooda,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,2.3,"Chahar to Warner, FOUR, he's waited on this slower ball, and then just chipped it back over Chahar's head. Superb from Warner, first to watch it like a hawk and then to have the composure",Chahar to Warner,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,2.4,"Chahar to Warner, FOUR, short and wide, it's met with a punishing slap over extra cover. Deserved the treatment it got, really poor delivery",Chahar to Warner,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,3.5,"SN Thakur to Warner, FOUR, awful from Thakur. Just bonus runs. Full toss outside off, Warner simply lays his bat on it and finds the gap through extra cover",SN Thakur to Warner,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,4.0,"SN Thakur to Warner, FOUR, short of length outside off, Warner steps to the leg-side to add to the width that was on offer and carves it over extra cover. SRH have raced to 44 in four overs",SN Thakur to Warner,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,4.2,"Tahir to Warner, FOUR, kneels down and slog sweeps it behind square for a four! That was spilling down and has been helped on its way",Tahir to Warner,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,4.3,"Tahir to Warner, FOUR, this pocket-sized dynamite is exploding and taking CSK down to the smithereens here. Reverse swept over backward point for a four. He is in a hurry",Tahir to Warner,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,4.4,"Tahir to Warner, FOUR, the entire repertoire of shots is out there! The exhibition mode is on. Tossed up delivery and was driven into the covers for a four",Tahir to Warner,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,5.2,"Chahar to Warner, FOUR, Chahar's stocks are on a free fall. Short, slow, Warner gets into position and pulls it over short fine leg for a one bounce four",Chahar to Warner,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,5.3,"Chahar to Warner, FOUR, and that is fifty for Warner! He has wasted no time today to get going. 45th Fifty plus score for Warner. Flat-batted it down the ground and got it over mid-on for a four. On a track where batters have struggled for timing, he has looked in supreme touch",Chahar to Warner,FOUR
5962210,SRH 1st Inns,9.3,"Jadeja to Bairstow, FOUR, charges out, goes through with the shot and gets it over the bowler's head for a one bounce four",Jadeja to Bairstow,FOUR
4183842,DC 1st Inns,0.2,"Hardik Pandya to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, too short, too wide, carved away between point and cover point for a four. Got the room and got the boundary to get off the mark",Hardik Pandya to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR

4183842,DC 1st Inns,1.2,"Rahul Chahar to Dhawan, FOUR, fetches it from outside off and has swept it past square leg for a four. More of a hacked sweep to get it past the fielder",Rahul Chahar to Dhawan,FOUR
4183842,DC 1st Inns,1.4,"Rahul Chahar to Dhawan, FOUR, takes it from the sticks and gets it between short fine and square leg for a four. More off the inner half of the bat but that was enough",Rahul Chahar to Dhawan,FOUR
4183842,DC 1st Inns,15.0,"Malinga to Axar, FOUR, and another ventilator-shot - the kind that just about keeps a chase alive. It's another slower-wide combo, but Axar's not getting fooled (any longer). Throws his bat out and slices it away over extra cover",Malinga to Axar,FOUR
4183842,DC 1st Inns,18.4,"Malinga to Mishra, leg byes, FOUR, loses radar. Well down leg, and Mishra gets a tickle off his pads, under Quinton's rather lazy dive as well",Malinga to Mishra,FOUR
4183842,DC 1st Inns,2.3,"Malinga to Dhawan, FOUR, hangs back on that slower and wide ball to slam it off the front foot. Didn't preempt and got the gap on the off-side for a four",Malinga to Dhawan,FOUR
4183842,DC 1st Inns,2.5,"Malinga to Dhawan, FOUR, picks the bones out of that dead meat of a slower ball! Charges out, gets hold of the length and goes through with the lofted hit to send it packing through the covers. Was aerial and landed a few times before the fence",Malinga to Dhawan,FOUR
4183842,DC 1st Inns,5.5,"Jayant Yadav to Dhawan, FOUR, oh superb shot. Drifting in on leg stump, and Dhawan just whips it over midwicket. It was too full from Jayant, and so he was right to the pitch of it. Didn't have to worry about playing against the turn",Jayant Yadav to Dhawan,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,1.4,"Rabada to Rohit, FOUR, classy from Rohit. Displaying pure elegance. Half-volley from Rabada at 149.4kph, immense bat-speed from Rohit as he props forward and times the drive sublimely through extra cover. Just rocketed away to the fence",Rabada to Rohit,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,10.1,"Mishra to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, gets as low as possible and scoops the full ball to the left of the keeper, timed it well and the pace on the ball took care of the rest",Mishra to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,13.3,"Rabada to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, slower ball bouncer and SKY had just ample time to pick that off the back foot, he arches slightly and ramps it over the keeper with a touch of delicacy",Rabada to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,15.4,"Rabada to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, that's a gimme from Rabada! 144ks slipping down the leg-side, KP helps it on its away with a fine tickle off his pads to the fine leg fence",Rabada to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,17.0,"Chris Morris to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, fuller, wider, squeezed, four! Bowls it quick and full, the quicker hands of the batter come into play and squirt the ball past point for a four. Much needed one",Chris Morris to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,17.2,"K Paul to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, does he have the hands of an artisan? Because that was crafty. Length delivery at the sticks, Krunal Pandya creates room and just opens the bat face at the last moment to run it down past the short third fielder",K Paul to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,17.4,"K Paul to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, walloped! The latex-laden iron wrists come into play and whip the ball away between long-on and deep mid for a four",K Paul to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,19.0,"Chris Morris to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, misses the mark again and overcompensates with a full toss. That was helped on its way over the short fine fielder. Hardik hasn't been missing anything though. Anything in his range has been disappearing",Chris Morris to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,19.4,"Rabada to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, length delivery just outside off and has been whipped from there. Difficult shot to call but was a hybrid of the helicopter that his brother had played a few balls back. Bisected the gap between deep square and deep mid",Rabada to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,19.5,"Rabada to Krunal Pandya, FOUR, throws his bat at a length delivery and gets it past the man at point for a four. MI are running away with the show here",Rabada to Krunal Pandya,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,3.2,"Chris Morris to Rohit, FOUR, 8000 runs in T20s for Rohit, reaches the milestone in a streaky fashion. Pitched up just outside off, Rohit throws his bat hard seeking for a swing downtown, gets a thick inside edge which misses the stumps and runs away to the fine leg fence",Chris Morris to Rohit,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,3.4,"Chris Morris to de Kock, FOUR, Morris misses his mark and de Kock dispatches it duly to the fence. Hurls in a low full toss just outside off, de Kock strides out and drills it - skews it off the bottom part but enough to beat mid-off",Chris Morris to de Kock,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,4.3,"Ishant to Rohit, FOUR, doesn't get it where he intended, however still collects a boundary. Back of a length delivery, holds up a touch on the pitch and Rohit is through his pull short early. Ends up trimming it off the cue-end past mid-off",Ishant to Rohit,FOUR
4183842,MI 1st Inns,9.0,"Mishra to de Kock, FOUR, picks the gap does Quinton de Kock, it was full and in his zone - he goes down on one knee and hammers it over mid-wicket to ping it in the gap between long-on and deep square. Smart batting!",Mishra to de Kock,FOUR
7621139,KKR 1st Inns,0.3,"Steyn to Narine, leg byes, FOUR, inswinger on middle and leg, Narine hops and gets a fine tickle on the thigh pad and Steyn's pace takes care of the rest",Steyn to Narine,FOUR

7621139,KKR 1st Inns,10.3,"Chahal to Nitish Rana, FOUR, goes the other way round! Changes grips and goes for the reverse hit, ends up getting a top-edge that flies over short third man. Four more for the left hander",Chahal to Nitish Rana,FOUR
7621139,KKR 1st Inns,11.2,"Stoinis to Nitish Rana, FOUR, short and punished! Width on offer outside off, Rana plays a upper cut and sends this loosener to the boundary at deep point. Still no six in this innings",Stoinis to Nitish Rana,FOUR
7621139,KKR 1st Inns,12.2,"Chahal to Nitish Rana, FOUR, Rana keeps getting those boundaries! KKR need a few more of these. Was a loopy legbreak down the leg side and the left hander sweeps it past the fielder at short fine leg, getting a move on. Slowly but surely",Chahal to Nitish Rana,FOUR
7621139,KKR 1st Inns,13.2,"Navdeep Saini to A Russell, FOUR, square-cut! Short in length outside off, Russell makes room and absolutely powers it past the man at point. That went to the boundary ropes before any of the fielders could blink their eye",Navdeep Saini to A Russell,FOUR
7621139,KKR 1st Inns,15.1,"Navdeep Saini to Nitish Rana, FOUR, boundaries flowing from both ends now! Rana goes deep in his crease and bludgeons the length delivery past the man at long-on. Good connection there!",Navdeep Saini to Nitish Rana,FOUR
7621139,KKR 1st Inns,16.2,"Siraj to A Russell, FOUR, hammered! Russell pounces on the width on offer and slams it past point. His front foot was in the air like a flamingo when he connected this one",Siraj to A Russell,FOUR
7621139,KKR 1st Inns,18.0,"Steyn to Nitish Rana, FOUR, 18 runs of Steyn's final over! KKR need 43 off the remaining two. Full in length outside off, Rana pounces on the opportunity once again and thumps it over the infield at extra cover. That almost went the distance. Dre Russ back on strike",Steyn to Nitish Rana,FOUR
7621139,KKR 1st Inns,2.1,"Steyn to Narine, FOUR, makes room, creates his own width and smashes the length delivery through covers. Simple cricket!",Steyn to Narine,FOUR
7621139,KKR 1st Inns,2.4,"Steyn to Narine, FOUR, connects this time and although it hasn't met the middle, Narine's muscled it in the gap between mid-on and mid-wicket to send it racing along to the turf",Steyn to Narine,FOUR
7621139,KKR 1st Inns,2.5,"Steyn to Narine, FOUR, gets a hint of width outside off, Narine throws the kitchen sink and the top-edge flies to the third man fence in a giffy, no chance for the fielder in the deep",Steyn to Narine,FOUR
7621139,KKR 1st Inns,4.4,"Steyn to Shubman Gill, FOUR, stands tall and slaps a 137ks good length delivery past Virat Kohli at mid-off, played it with a flat bat and managed to pierce the gap between mid-off and extra cover",Steyn to Shubman Gill,FOUR

7621139,KKR 1st Inns,7.1,"Siraj to Nitish Rana, FOUR, lovely shot by Rana! Pitched on a full length outside off, Rana eyes the covers boundary and lifts this one over the infield. No fielders in the deep and that shall be four runs for the left hander",Siraj to Nitish Rana,FOUR
7621139,KKR 1st Inns,9.1,"Siraj to Uthappa, FOUR, there you go! Uthappa breaks the string of dots with a sublime boundary. Makes a hint of room, stays leg-side of the full delivery and clobbers it through extra cover with ease",Siraj to Uthappa,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,12.5,"Narine to Moeen Ali, FOUR, that's fortuitous for Ali. Narine fires it in, Ali was setting up for a wild slog and goes hard. It cuts him for room and the batsman gets a thick inside edge which shaves the leg-stump and runs away to the fine leg fence",Narine to Moeen Ali,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,13.2,"Kuldeep Yadav to Moeen Ali, FOUR, finesse followed by power. So smart from Ali, saw the quicker ball and stays rooted to the crease. Uses the pace and opens his bat face to guide it in the pocket between backward point and short third man",Kuldeep Yadav to Moeen Ali,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,14.3,"Prasidh to Kohli, FOUR, leading edge and it balloons over short third man. Got to feel for the bowler, set him up really well. Good length delivery, seaming in and just straightens off the pitch. Kohli was aiming for an across-the-hoick and lost his shape. Thick edge and gets away fortunately as it soars over the fielder's head before rolling away to the fence",Prasidh to Kohli,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,14.5,"Prasidh to Moeen Ali, FOUR, another edge and another four. Shortish and moved away just enough, Ali swings his bat and gets an outside edge which loops over the keeper",Prasidh to Moeen Ali,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,15.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Moeen Ali, FOUR, hammered past long-off. Flighted outside off, Ali lowers his stance and reaches out to smack it in the gap. Even Dre Russ can't stop that",Kuldeep Yadav to Moeen Ali,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,15.3,"Kuldeep Yadav to Moeen Ali, FOUR, wow! Ali is full flow here. Kuldeep is not learning. Pitches it up in the slot, Ali keeps a solid base and dumps it straight down the ground",Kuldeep Yadav to Moeen Ali,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,16.2,"Gurney to Kohli, FOUR, swivel-pulled past short fine leg. Off-pace delivery from Gurney, too short and down leg. Kohli pulls it hard and places it in the gap",Gurney to Kohli,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,16.4,"Gurney to Kohli, FOUR, squeezes the drive in the gap between cover and point. Wide yorker from Gurney, Kohli gets his bat down quickly and times it superbly to pick up his second boundary of the over",Gurney to Kohli,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,18.3,"Prasidh to Kohli, FOUR, shot of the innings so far. Flamboyance from Kohli. Krishna corrects his length and wafts it full outside off. Kohli bends low, chases it and drives it off the meat through extra cover. It just zoomed away to the fence in a jiffy",Prasidh to Kohli,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,19.0,"Prasidh to Stoinis, FOUR, it doesn't matter for Stoinis. He joins the party as well. Walks across his stumps, waits deep and absolutely spanks it wide of long-off, who gives up the chase. Another massive over, 19 off it",Prasidh to Stoinis,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,19.2,"Gurney to Stoinis, FOUR, Kuldeep is having a forgettable outing. Slower short ball, Stoinis pivots back and pulls it uppishly. Lands in front of Kuldeep at deep square leg, who perhaps gets caught in two-minds. Doesn't attempt a catch and neither does he gets his body in the line. It sprang up and loops over his head to the fence",Gurney to Stoinis,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,19.5,"Gurney to Kohli, FOUR, the moment has arrived. Hundred for Kohli. His first this season and look at him go. Leaps up, roars in delight and brandishes his bat. Even the Kolkata crowd are going bonkers. Special knock from the Indian captain. Shuffles across his stumps and whiplashes it through mid-wicket. Kuldeep's miserable day continues as he fails to stop the ball near the fence",Gurney to Kohli,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,2.1,"Prasidh to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, ah, you don't nail yorkers better -- 144kph on the base of off. Parthiv desperately jams his bat down, somehow getting an inside tickle past his stumps, and there's nothing fine leg's running dive can do to stop it either",Prasidh to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,3.0,"Prasidh to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, gets away. Krishna bangs it short again outside off, which Patel throws his hands out to - more in getting out of this non-self-imposed shell - and slaps it powerfully over point. It also helps his cause that it is the tiny Piyush Chawa fielding there",Prasidh to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,3.3,"Narine to Kohli, FOUR, hard pull, straight to deep mid-wicket. Yea, simple, single. But no, Gill messes up, bending low a little too casually and letting the ball slip through",Narine to Kohli,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,5.5,"Prasidh to Kohli, FOUR, 143.8kph. And Kohli's being given a real workout here -- this time undoing him on a flick across the line, only for the genuine leading edge flying away through an empty slip cordon",Prasidh to Kohli,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,7.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Kohli, FOUR, loopy dip, but Kohli's just too smart. He runs down, maybe yorking himself in the process, but why bother when you have bottom-hands as good as these .. drills it straight down",Kuldeep Yadav to Kohli,FOUR
7621139,RCB 1st Inns,7.3,"Kuldeep Yadav to Kohli, FOUR, more flight, this time drifting wide outside off. Kohli moves the other way, piling on the overcook to carve it away through sweeper",Kuldeep Yadav to Kohli,FOUR
8363749,MI 1st Inns,10.0,"D Kulkarni to de Kock, FOUR, fifty for de Kock. Second against Rajasthan this season. Can this be a match winning one? He knew fine leg was square, so he walked across his stumps and scooped the slower delivery to the vacant fine leg fence",D Kulkarni to de Kock,FOUR
8363749,MI 1st Inns,13.3,"Binny to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, he must be relieved. Binny tries a leg-cutter and ends up bowling a full toss, Suryakumar takes a step out to get under it and slams it straight back, one bounce and over the ropes",Binny to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
8363749,MI 1st Inns,17.0,"Unadkat to Cutting, FOUR, nicely done! Cutting's off the mark with a boundary. That was all about precision. A length delivery angled across him and the Australian all-rounder guides it through the gap at point and short third man. Couldn't have placed it any better",Unadkat to Cutting,FOUR
8363749,MI 1st Inns,17.1,"Jofra Archer to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, first one of the innings for Pandya! Makes the most out of the pace on this ball. Shuffles in his crease and flicks the ball over backward square leg. No fielders in the deep and that shall be a boundary for Hardik",Jofra Archer to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
8363749,MI 1st Inns,18.2,"Unadkat to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, edged away to the fence! Angled across the batsman outside off, Pandya throws his bat at it and gets an outside edge past Samson. Although the keeper dived, he couldn't quite reach there. Can't keep a slip either with just 10 balls to go",Unadkat to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
8363749,MI 1st Inns,2.2,"Shreyas Gopal to Rohit, FOUR, top-edge and four, pushed through quicker and sliding down leg, Rohit was down on his knees as he swept, off the top-edge and went wide of the fielder in the circle at short fine",Shreyas Gopal to Rohit,FOUR
8363749,MI 1st Inns,3.1,"D Kulkarni to de Kock, FOUR, cracking shot, tad too full from Dhawal, de Kock takes a step forward and then drills it back at the bowler, too pacy though and Dhawal has no chance in stopping it",D Kulkarni to de Kock,FOUR
8363749,MI 1st Inns,3.2,"D Kulkarni to de Kock, FOUR, lovely, tad too short and wide of off, de Kock came down the track, made room as he did so and cracked it square past cover-point for a boundary",D Kulkarni to de Kock,FOUR
8363749,MI 1st Inns,3.3,"D Kulkarni to de Kock, FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries, Dhawal tried to follow de Kock as he came down the track, too short though and it's helped off the pads - over short fine and rolls away to the ropes",D Kulkarni to de Kock,FOUR
8363749,MI 1st Inns,4.5,"Jofra Archer to de Kock, FOUR, cracking shot, too full and too wide of off, de Kock gets well forward and drills it over cover, couple of bounces and over the ropes",Jofra Archer to de Kock,FOUR
8363749,MI 1st Inns,5.5,"Unadkat to Suryakumar Yadav, leg byes, FOUR, this is poor bowling from Unadkat, might not go against him, but it's still a boundary against the team. Too full and on Suryakumar's pads, he was looking to flick and missed, brushed the pads and beat the diving keeper",Unadkat to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
8363749,MI 1st Inns,8.0,"Binny to de Kock, FOUR, that's a poor ball to end the over, short and on de Kock's pads, he gets inside the line and pulls it fine - past Archer's dive at short fine",Binny to de Kock,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,0.4,"Hardik Pandya to Samson, FOUR, Sanju wasting no time, gets going with a first-ball boundary. Latches on to the length delivery and pulls it through mid-wicket without much hassle, beats the sprinter in the deep quite convincingly",Hardik Pandya to Samson,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,0.5,"Hardik Pandya to Samson, FOUR, two in two for Samson! Uses the pace on this short of a length delivery and glides it past the fielder at short third man. The dive by the man inside the ring wasn't able to stop the ball from making it to the fence",Hardik Pandya to Samson,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,1.2,"Krunal Pandya to Samson, FOUR, Samson taking on the Pandya brothers. Makes room for himself and lofts the tossed up delivery straight over the bowler's head, four more for the youngster",Krunal Pandya to Samson,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,1.5,"Krunal Pandya to Samson, FOUR, beautiful shot! Goes inside-out and times this fullish delivery over extra cover. Was timed so neatly that it almost went the distance",Krunal Pandya to Samson,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,10.2,"Krunal Pandya to Riyan Parag, FOUR, promising start here from Riyan Parag. A couple of boundaries already. This is flat at the stumps, and he's down on one knee to put the slog-sweep away through deep midwicket",Krunal Pandya to Riyan Parag,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,13.4,"Hardik Pandya to Riyan Parag, FOUR, yup, getting cheeky isn't a bad way of breaking the shackles. Pandya gets a touch predictable with one good length too many, and Parag shuffles quickly, realizes fine leg is inside the circle and scoops it away over him",Hardik Pandya to Riyan Parag,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,13.5,"Hardik Pandya to Riyan Parag, FOUR, more leg-lined, but Parag's quick to make room this time, and his outside edge is thick and hard enough in the wafty drive to run away through the empty slip",Hardik Pandya to Riyan Parag,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,15.5,"Malinga to Riyan Parag, FOUR, so now some feet as well. This kid's putting up a show here, stepping away from the line, getting under the good length to go inside-out over extra cover",Malinga to Riyan Parag,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,16.1,"Bumrah to Smith, FOUR, wow. So damn neat. A very tight cramping back of a length stuff, which Smith waits, and waits on, lets it get really close to him before opening up his bat face and guiding it perfectly behind point, and toying around with the angle for third man to cut off either",Bumrah to Smith,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,17.5,"Hardik Pandya to Smith, FOUR, the horrors of a short-wide combo. Smith arches back, throws his hands out and smashes a cut wide of backward point's left reach",Hardik Pandya to Smith,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,19.1,"Malinga to Binny, FOUR, aand it doesn't EVER mater where your fielders are when the ball is a very friendly full toss drifting down leg.

8363749,RR 1st Inns,2.0,"Krunal Pandya to Samson, FOUR, 15 runs of Krunal's first over! Rajasthan couldn't have asked for a better start. Another floated delivery around off, that doesn't spin much. Samson moves to an extent and creams it through the gap at covers yet again. Three boundaries in the over and the Royals are off to a flier",Krunal Pandya to Samson,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,2.3,"Malinga to Samson, byes, FOUR, de Kock apologizes as he makes a mess of it. Should have been stopped by him, but instead it's four byes. The boundaries are leaking and Royals wouldn't mind it. Samson was looking to guide the slower delivery through third man but got beaten due to the lack of pace. The keeper couldn't gather it cleanly as he parried it away to the fence in the process",Malinga to Samson,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,3.1,"Rahul Chahar to Rahane, FOUR, welcome into the attack Mr. Chahar! A short legbreak with width on offer, Rahane eyes lit up on seeing that and he chops it through the gap at point and short third man, sublime",Rahul Chahar to Rahane,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,3.2,"Rahul Chahar to Rahane, FOUR, the leg spinner has been put under pressure right away! Rahane goes down on his knee and sweeps the tossed up delivery over square leg, four more",Rahul Chahar to Rahane,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,4.0,"Rahul Chahar to Samson, FOUR, has been an exhibition of finesse by Samson so far... It's not about power always. A floated delivery down the leg side and it's been lapped down to the fine leg boundary by Sanju. He's moved on to 26 off 11 balls",Rahul Chahar to Samson,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,5.3,"Malinga to Smith, FOUR, lashes the cut between backward point and short third man. Short and wide from Malinga, and this time it was a normal pace delivery. Smith used that pace and carved it away",Malinga to Smith,FOUR
8363749,RR 1st Inns,5.5,"Malinga to Smith, FOUR, short of length outside off, punched through backward point. With this field - no protection deep on the off-side - there's no room to offer any width which Malinga has done a couple of times already",Malinga to Smith,FOUR

8363749,RR 1st Inns,9.0,"Markande to Riyan Parag, FOUR, short again from Markande, and Parag doesn't need to get his eye in to dispatch it. He rocks back and thwacks it wide of deep midwicket. Not the follow-up MI needed after that Chahar over",Markande to Riyan Parag,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,1.2,"Sam Curran to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, sits up nicely in the slot. Shaw continues with his really high backlift, lofting a whack straight down the ground",Sam Curran to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,1.5,"Sam Curran to Dhawan, FOUR, 124.3kph, massive slip down leg. And Dhawan couldn't have asked for it easier, going through his full-blooded pick-up-and-swipe shot behind square",Sam Curran to Dhawan,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,13.2,"Viljoen to Dhawan, FOUR, Delhi inching closer to the target! Dhawan is looking unstoppable, just like he was against KKR.

2326553,DC 1st Inns,14.3,"Sam Curran to Pant, FOUR, misfield by Gayle and that shall be the first boundary of the innings for Pant. Was a slower short ball down the leg side and Pant helped it to short fine leg where Gayle got his hands to it and parried it away to the fine leg fence",Sam Curran to Pant,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,15.0,"Sam Curran to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, Curran looks disappointed as Iyer ends the over with a boundary. Makes room for himself and slices the length delivery over short third man. There were two fielders stationed there but both were inside the circle. Toying with the field is Iyer at the moment. Just 36 needed off 5 overs",Sam Curran to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,16.0,"Viljoen to Ingram, FOUR, safe shot by Ingram as he eyes the vacant deep mid-wicket boundary. A short ball around off, the southpaw stands tall and slogs it over mid-wicket. One bounce and over the fence for as Ingram gets his first boundary",Viljoen to Ingram,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,17.3,"Viljoen to Ingram, FOUR, that's an excellent shot by Ingram. Was a yorker outside off and the South African squeezes it past the man at short third man. Gayle had no chance to even react as the ball raced past him and rushed into the fence",Viljoen to Ingram,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,17.5,"Viljoen to Ingram, FOUR, Ingram is finding the gaps in the field like a boss. A short ball at the hips and it's been dragged through deep square leg by the southpaw, second boundary of the over. He hasn't taken any risks either",Viljoen to Ingram,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,18.0,"Viljoen to Ingram, FOUR, another cracking shot to end the over. Backs away, makes room and crunches the overpitched delivery through cover-point for his third boundary of the over. The required run is down to 5 now",Viljoen to Ingram,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,19.4,"Sam Curran to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, Shreyas Iyer hits the winning runs - it's a boundary! Sixth win of the season for the Delhi Capitals as their captain sends this one away to the deep mid-wicket fence with a fantastic pull shot. Nerves of steel by the young skipper towards the closing stages. DC beat KXIP by 5 wickets",Sam Curran to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,2.5,"Shami to Dhawan, FOUR, and Dhawan and his cover drives. Shami floates it full, gives out width as well. Sliced, powerfully, and over extra cover's leap from within the circle",Shami to Dhawan,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,3.2,"Viljoen to Dhawan, FOUR, lucky edge. Dhawan charges down to open up a cut over the off-side, but the bounce gets big on him, and the outside splice is good enough to fly over the slip cordon",Viljoen to Dhawan,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,3.3,"Viljoen to Dhawan, FOUR, nothing lucky here, it's a proper crunch. Viljoen goes shorter, but ends up dishing out a half tracker, which Dhawan can upper-cut now, and there being no third man helps his cause as well",Viljoen to Dhawan,FOUR

2326553,DC 1st Inns,8.3,"Ashwin to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, no slip in place and this outside edge has run away for four. Grip and turn with the carrom ball for Ashwin, enough to find Iyer's outside edge and also enough to keep rolling into the ropes",Ashwin to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2326553,DC 1st Inns,9.3,"Murugan Ashwin to Dhawan, FOUR, he's fetched this googly from outside leg stump and reverse-swept it through backward point. Incredible shot",Murugan Ashwin to Dhawan,FOUR

2326553,KXIP 1st Inns,15.1,"Mishra to Mandeep, FOUR, horrible bowling and that is putting it mildly. Rank long hop outside off and this time Mandeep does not miss out, he waits and holds his shape to slap it over extra cover, one bounce and over the ropes",Mishra to Mandeep,FOUR

2326553,KXIP 1st Inns,17.5,"Rabada to Ashwin, FOUR, lots of clubbing in this. A 117.1kph slower cutter tried, digging it short, which Ashwin goes right behind to in mowing it very agriculturally into cow corner",Rabada to Ashwin,FOUR
2326553,KXIP 1st Inns,18.2,"Ishant to Harpreet Brar, FOUR, 139.8kph, corrects his overdose of wides with a shorter, but wide one nevertheless. Brar carves, uppishly, over extra cover",Ishant to Harpreet Brar,FOUR
2326553,KXIP 1st Inns,2.4,"Ishant to Gayle, FOUR, neatly done, Ishant took some pace off the ball and angled it across the left-hander, Gayle waited on it, played it with an open face and ran it past short third man",Ishant to Gayle,FOUR
2326553,KXIP 1st Inns,3.1,"Lamichhane to Gayle, FOUR, they're looking to attack Lamichhane, too short and too straight from the leg-spinner, Gayle rocks back and pulls it behind square on the on-side for a boundary",Lamichhane to Gayle,FOUR
2326553,KXIP 1st Inns,3.3,"Lamichhane to Gayle, FOUR, belted, Lamichhane got a hand onto it, but such was the fierceness of the shot - he could only get a hand onto it - tossed up on middle, Gayle pressed forward and drilled it back at the bowler, will go down as a half-chance",Lamichhane to Gayle,FOUR
2326553,KXIP 1st Inns,3.5,"Lamichhane to Gayle, FOUR, too full and sliding down leg, Gayle bends half-way down and sweeps it fine - Ishant, at short fine dived over the ball and lets another boundary through",Lamichhane to Gayle,FOUR
2326553,KXIP 1st Inns,4.0,"Lamichhane to Gayle, FOUR, 16 from the over, Lamichhane dropped this one short and well outside off, Gayle rocked back and punched it hard - into the gap wide of cover-point, no need to run for those",Lamichhane to Gayle,FOUR
2326553,KXIP 1st Inns,5.0,"Rabada to Miller, FOUR, streaky and four, on a good length and from round the wicket, Miller was late in getting his bat down, squirted off the inside edge and past short fine, runs away to the ropes in a hurry",Rabada to Miller,FOUR

5568908,KKR 1st Inns,0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Chris Lynn, FOUR, that is not the place to bowl to Lynn or for that matter any batsman. Short and outside off, Lynn had the width and he slaps it hard through the packed off-side field. No need to run for that",Bhuvneshwar to Chris Lynn,FOUR
5568908,KKR 1st Inns,1.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Narine, FOUR, help yourself delivery and Narine does just that.

5568908,KKR 1st Inns,1.1,"Nadeem to Chris Lynn, FOUR, poor start from Nadeem. Half tracker and Lynn does not miss out, he plays the back foot punch past extra cover and the timing takes care of the rest. He relied on timing rather than power",Nadeem to Chris Lynn,FOUR
5568908,KKR 1st Inns,11.2,"Sandeep Sharma to Chris Lynn, FOUR, much needed boundary for KKR! Lynn latches on to the short ball and swivel-pulls it into the gap at deep mid-wicket. The ball drops just in front of the boundary cushions, such sweet was the timing",Sandeep Sharma to Chris Lynn,FOUR
5568908,KKR 1st Inns,14.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rinku Singh, FOUR, Rinku finally connects one. A wide delivery that was angled across the left hander who punches it past the fielder at cover. The fielder in the deep was way too square in order to cut this down",Bhuvneshwar to Rinku Singh,FOUR
5568908,KKR 1st Inns,16.4,"Khaleel Ahmed to Chris Lynn, FOUR, another miscue but it won't matter. Lynn brings up his 9th fifty in IPL.

5568908,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Khaleel Ahmed to Narine, FOUR, Narine is already winning the mental battle. Khaleel goes for the yorker and misses it, the low full toss outside off and Narine spoons it over the off-side field, the fast outfield does the rest",Khaleel Ahmed to Narine,FOUR
5568908,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"Sandeep Sharma to Nitish Rana, FOUR, shot! Fuller and outside off, Rana leans forward and creams the drive past cover-point, Nadeem ran behind the ball and only managed to escort it to the fence. The dive never came",Sandeep Sharma to Nitish Rana,FOUR

5568908,SRH 1st Inns,1.5,"Yarra Prithviraj to Bairstow, FOUR, Cariappa has denied Yarra Prithviraj his maiden wicket in IPL.

5568908,SRH 1st Inns,8.2,"Cariappa to Bairstow, FOUR, spinning away outside off, had been pushed through the air much quicker. Bairstow sits back in the crease, anticipating it, and dabs it cunningly past the keeper",Cariappa to Bairstow,FOUR

7225586,CSK 1st Inns,16.5,"Navdeep Saini to Dhoni, FOUR, flies off the outside edge past short third man, no chance for the fielder who was inside the ring. He just threw his hands at the slightest amount of width that Saini had provided",Navdeep Saini to Dhoni,FOUR

7225586,CSK 1st Inns,3.5,"U Yadav to du Plessis, leg byes, FOUR, terrible delivery! That's Umesh for you. Two ends of the spectrum can be seen. Was well down leg and clipped the pads off the attempted heave to run away to the fine leg fence",U Yadav to du Plessis,FOUR
7225586,CSK 1st Inns,5.0,"Steyn to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, luck's written all over that delivery. A peach of an inswinger from Steyn, bowled at 139ks and nearly cut Jadhav into half.

7225586,CSK 1st Inns,5.4,"U Yadav to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, just a flick of the wrists, nothing less nothing more! Sees the ball angle into his pads and unveiled those whippy wrists on the flick did Kedar Jadhav, all the way through mid-wicket...",U Yadav to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
7225586,CSK 1st Inns,6.0,"U Yadav to Dhoni, FOUR, streaky! Would have been out had there been a backward point, wasn't to be. Dhoni gets a full ball outside off and he fishes at it sans any feet, sliced it off the thick outside edge and it flies square past non-existent point",U Yadav to Dhoni,FOUR
7225586,CSK 1st Inns,6.3,"Navdeep Saini to Rayudu, FOUR, short ball outside off, Rayudu had some extra time to adjust as it was around the 130ks, he arches back and ramps it over non-existent short third",Navdeep Saini to Rayudu,FOUR

7225586,RCB 1st Inns,14.0,"Dwayne Bravo to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, Patel ends the over with a boundary and moves closer to his fifty. Gets a full toss and the southpaw makes sure to chip it over the infield at covers. No fielders in the deep and that's an easy four",Dwayne Bravo to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
7225586,RCB 1st Inns,15.3,"Dwayne Bravo to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, RCB fans give Parthiv a standing ovation as the opener gets to his fifty with a boundary.

7225586,RCB 1st Inns,19.2,"Dwayne Bravo to Moeen Ali, FOUR, with the point and cover point in, the fuller ball was a bad idea. Moeen Ali got his bat down and slammed it over point for a four. The wrists of steel came into play",Dwayne Bravo to Moeen Ali,FOUR

7225586,RCB 1st Inns,3.3,"SN Thakur to de Villiers, FOUR, AB is away. They need a move on and who better than de Villiers to rely on. Not a bad delivery by any means. Back of a length delivery and de Villiers thumps it over mid-on, one bounce and over the ropes",SN Thakur to de Villiers,FOUR
7225586,RCB 1st Inns,5.5,"SN Thakur to de Villiers, FOUR, Thakur has lost his line in the last 10 balls or so. Strays on the pads and that is easy pickings, de Villiers flicks it in front of square and Tahir's dive was nowhere close to the ball",SN Thakur to de Villiers,FOUR
7225586,RCB 1st Inns,6.0,"SN Thakur to de Villiers, FOUR, 16 runs to end the powerplay. Thakur tries to follow the backing away de Villiers with a full delivery, but ends up bowling it in the slot, pumped right back over and the ball bounces just inside the fence",SN Thakur to de Villiers,FOUR

7436247,DC 1st Inns,1.5,"D Kulkarni to Dhawan, FOUR, just look how quick the outfield is. This wasn't middled whatsoever but the pace makes it easier for Dhawan.

7436247,DC 1st Inns,11.1,"Shreyas Gopal to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, this is such a fantastic shot. He was beaten in length after stepping out, as Gopal pulled it well back. But Shaw remains undeterred, going through with the cover drive and creaming it to the fence",Shreyas Gopal to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
7436247,DC 1st Inns,12.3,"Unadkat to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, Shaw has found the gap to perfection. There was a man at fine leg and at deep mid-wicket but Prithvi Shaw pulls it right between the two fielders. The timing was also good enough and it races to the fence",Unadkat to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
7436247,DC 1st Inns,13.5,"D Kulkarni to Pant, FOUR, excellent from Pant, he knows Kulkarni is one of the weaker bowler in this Royals attack and he wants to target him.

7436247,DC 1st Inns,2.1,"Unadkat to Dhawan, FOUR, another sublime shot by Shikhar! Puts on his dancing shoes and bludgeons the shortish delivery through mid-on. The fielder was very square, hence this was always heading to the fence",Unadkat to Dhawan,FOUR
7436247,DC 1st Inns,3.2,"Shreyas Gopal to Dhawan, FOUR, he loves to bat on these kind of tracks, doesn't he? Walks down the wicket and lifts it over the bowler's head for four more. There was a fielder at long-on but this just manages to beat his sprint",Shreyas Gopal to Dhawan,FOUR

4398515,CSK 1st Inns,13.1,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, FOUR, smashed away! A trifle too short from Rashid and Rayudu picked the length early. Swivelled and pulled it hard, bisecting deep mid-wicket and long-on perfectly",Rashid Khan to Rayudu,FOUR
4398515,CSK 1st Inns,13.3,"Rashid Khan to Watson, FOUR, smacked away by Watson! Got down on his knees and swept this hard in front of square through the leg-side. Sandeep got across with a slide but couldn't palm it away properly",Rashid Khan to Watson,FOUR

4398515,CSK 1st Inns,16.0,"Rashid Khan to Watson, FOUR, 15 off the over! Watson is motoring towards yet another IPL century! Too short from Rashid and the Aussie sits back to pull this away through backward square leg. Short fine leg is the only man there",Rashid Khan to Watson,FOUR

4398515,CSK 1st Inns,5.4,"Sandeep Sharma to Raina, FOUR, this isn't intentional, but it's useful. Length ball outside off, Raina had charged down looking to biff no matter what.

4398515,CSK 1st Inns,5.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Raina, FOUR, fourth boundary of the over, third one in a row. The shackles have been broken.

4398515,SRH 1st Inns,4.1,"Chahar to Warner, FOUR, that's a tennis forehand, Roger would have been proud of that.

6274749,KXIP 1st Inns,0.5,"Southee to Gayle, FOUR, nicely done! Not a shot that you'd normally assocciate with Gayle. Short of a length ball outside off and the lefty used the bowler's pace to guide it through backward point and short third man",Southee to Gayle,FOUR

Slower short of length delivery and Karthik takes it on, the pull goes in front of square and Rahane covered a lot of ground from deep mid-wicket, dives full length to his right and gets both hands, but the ball pops out once he hit the surface and rolls into the ad cushions.

9676395,CSK 1st Inns,0.2,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR, missed out on his century by 4 runs in the previous game and here's a boundary two nights later. Short of a length outside off and Watto punches it firmly through the gap at covers. Lewis goes for the chase, puts in a dive near the fence as well but the momentum takes it away to the fence",Malinga to Watson,FOUR
9676395,CSK 1st Inns,0.3,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Watson. Short ball down the leg side and Watson glances it past the fielder at short fine leg, off to a rocket start",Malinga to Watson,FOUR
9676395,CSK 1st Inns,13.3,"Hardik Pandya to Dwayne Bravo, FOUR, and Dwayne Bravo takes full toll of the free-hit. Slower ball from a back of a length, Bravo hangs back, stays leg-side of the ball and throws his bat at it to carve it over short third man",Hardik Pandya to Dwayne Bravo,FOUR
9676395,CSK 1st Inns,14.3,"Rahul Chahar to Dwayne Bravo, FOUR, Chahar pulls his length back and Bravo has taken advantage of that. Sees it, rocks back and swivels to pull it through the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on",Rahul Chahar to Dwayne Bravo,FOUR
9676395,CSK 1st Inns,2.2,"Malinga to Vijay, FOUR, that wasn't a well timed shot by Vijay will take it. Short ball outside off, slow in place and Vijay cuts it over point. That was in the air and as he played it over the infield, he managed to beat the fielders",Malinga to Vijay,FOUR
9676395,CSK 1st Inns,3.3,"Hardik Pandya to Vijay, FOUR, elegance personified! On the pads and Vijay clips it with nonchalance over backward square leg. His best looking shot of the innings so far",Hardik Pandya to Vijay,FOUR
9676395,CSK 1st Inns,6.0,"Bumrah to Vijay, FOUR, uppishly pulled in front of deep backward square where Krunal Pandya charges in for the catch. Tough to say whether it carried, probably didn't, and because all his efforts were directed at going for the catch, he's not able to save the boundary",Bumrah to Vijay,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,0.1,"Chahar to Rohit, FOUR, Rohit starts off in a stellar fashion. It was full and was curving away from Rohit, he waits for the ball to deviate and guides it wide of cover for a boundary. He doesn't try to hit it too hard. Sweet timing!",Chahar to Rohit,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,10.4,"Santner to Rohit, FOUR, touch quicker and Santner also gives width outside off, Rohit stays low and plays the square drive really late, the timing was such that the fielder from sweeper couldn't get across to stop that",Santner to Rohit,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,11.5,"Dwayne Bravo to Rohit, FOUR, cheeky! Bravo goes short and outside off, Rohit stands up and elevates it above the 'keeper. He just used the pace on the ball and pocketed a boundary",Dwayne Bravo to Rohit,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,15.1,"Tahir to Rohit, FOUR, Rohit looks at the base of his bat. A rank long hop and he cue-ends the pull towards deep mid-wicket, Shorey runs around the rope and dives over the ball. Poor effort from him",Tahir to Rohit,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,15.2,"Tahir to Rohit, FOUR, Shorey again can't get there. Quicker and attacking the stumps, Rohit heaves it to cow corner - right between deep mid-wicket and long-on, Shorey runs to his left this time and can't stop the boundary",Tahir to Rohit,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,18.3,"Chahar to Pollard, FOUR, first one of the innings for Pollard. Finally gets one right. Wasn't middled though! Short of a length delivery that kept a touch low, KP swung hard at it and got an inside edge that rolled past the man at short fine leg. The fielder in the deep was very square too, hence he couldn't quite get there",Chahar to Pollard,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,19.1,"Dwayne Bravo to Pollard, FOUR, that's hammered! Right into the slot and the big arms take over. KP gets underneath it and smashes it over the bowler's head. Luckily there was some elevation, else Bravo's head could have been in trouble",Dwayne Bravo to Pollard,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,19.4,"Dwayne Bravo to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, that's a short-arm jab. A full toss on off and Pandya's strong bottom hand does all the talking. Short-arm jabs over Pollard who was ducking for cover. Pressure back on Bravo!",Dwayne Bravo to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,2.2,"Chahar to de Kock, FOUR, 10 off 2 in this over. Chahar has been belted for the first time in powerplay. He is clearly not used to it. And his response will be interesting to see. It was touch fuller of good length, de Kock picks up the length early and drives it like a boss. It beats cover and races to the fence",Chahar to de Kock,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,4.2,"Chahar to Lewis, FOUR, Lewis has controlled that shot brilliantly and it will fetch him four. It was slower down the leg-side, Lewis picks it up early, waits for it to arrive, gets on top of it and half-pulls it wide of fine leg for a boundary",Chahar to Lewis,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,4.3,"Chahar to Lewis, FOUR, edged and four! Streaky but Lewis would take it. It was on a good length and was wide of off, Lewis wanted to drive it away from the body. He plays down the wrong line and inside edge takes it wide of stumps and into the fence",Chahar to Lewis,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,5.0,"Chahar to Rohit, FOUR, four to finish the over. He has placed it brilliantly. It was short and was on the body, Rohit swivels and pulls it wide of short fine for a boundary",Chahar to Rohit,FOUR
9676395,MI 1st Inns,8.5,"Tahir to Lewis, FOUR, and again.. But not as well timed as the previous one. Flighted on a fullish length, Lewis lofts it straight back over Tahir and the ball bounces just inside the rope before beating the long-on fielder",Tahir to Lewis,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahane, FOUR, pinged off the middle! Rahane starting from where he left off in his previous game in Jaipur. Waits for the length delivery to swing in and presents full face of the bat and massages the drive through extra cover. Sheer timing!!",Bhuvneshwar to Rahane,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,12.0,"Shakib to Smith, FOUR, this time he goes much wider of long-on for a boundary. Nice use of the feet which takes him close enough to the ball that he can confidently whip his wrists against the turn. Good start from Smith",Shakib to Smith,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,12.1,"S Kaul to Samson, FOUR, just look at the timing and placement on that shot! Making batting look so effortless. Kaul continues to leak boundaries. Goes wide this time around and Samson slices it past the fielder at point. The fielder in the deep sprinted across to his left but couldn't stop it from finding the fence",S Kaul to Samson,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,12.2,"S Kaul to Samson, FOUR, another sublime shot! Tad short in length and Samson picks it with nonchalance over square leg. Again there was a fielder charging towards his right in the deep but the placement was just so perfect and the dive had no effect in the end result",S Kaul to Samson,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,14.5,"Khaleel Ahmed to Smith, FOUR, easy pickings! Short ball and down the leg side, around the hip and all Smith had to do is get some bat on it. Glances it very fine and the fielder in the deep was way too square to cut this down",Khaleel Ahmed to Smith,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,16.1,"Khaleel Ahmed to Samson, FOUR, stand and deliver! Everyone's admiring the shot including the bowler. Tad short in length and Samson bludgeons it over mid-wicket. Almost went the distance such was the timing",Khaleel Ahmed to Samson,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,16.3,"Khaleel Ahmed to Smith, FOUR, 50-run stand up for the third wicket but Samson has done majority of the scoring! Smith had flicked it to fine leg where Kaul slides to stop the ball. When he releases the ball to throw it, the fielder is in contact with the ropes. Nothing going SRH's way, nothing!",Khaleel Ahmed to Smith,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,19.1,"Shakib to Samson, FOUR, Samson hits the winning boundary! Treks back and drags the short ball into the gap at cow corner. No fielders in the deep and Rajasthan Royals beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 7 wickets to spice up the points table",Shakib to Samson,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahane, FOUR, gets a full delivery on the stumps, Rahane picks the field change (long-on moved to mid-on for this delivery) and whips it with flair over the ring on the leg-side",Bhuvneshwar to Rahane,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahane, FOUR, looks to follow Rahane and spills a half-volley on the pads, Rahane brings his bottom hand into play by whipping it powerfully wide of the fielder at deep square",Bhuvneshwar to Rahane,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,5.0,"Khaleel Ahmed to Rahane, FOUR, makes room to open up the off-side, slashes hard and gets lucky with a thick top-edge that flies over short third man",Khaleel Ahmed to Rahane,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,5.1,"S Kaul to Livingstone, FOUR, short of length around off, Livingstone pulls it gleefully past short fine leg. Nothing ball from Siddarth Kaul",S Kaul to Livingstone,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,5.5,"S Kaul to Livingstone, FOUR, back of a length on middle, Livingstone clears the front leg and mows it over mid-on. He's taken a liking to Kaul",S Kaul to Livingstone,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,6.5,"Rashid Khan to Livingstone, FOUR, rocks back to this short ball and thumps it through square leg. Rollicking entry into the season from Livingstone",Rashid Khan to Livingstone,FOUR
9570712,RR 1st Inns,7.3,"Shakib to Livingstone, FOUR, hammers it down the ground. Brute power from Livingstone, who was nowhere near the pitch of it after stepping out. But the slowness of the surface allowed him to adjust before he brought the sledgehammer down and smashed it",Shakib to Livingstone,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,1.2,"Thomas to Williamson, FOUR, Rajasthan having a torrid time in the field. Aaron now concedes a boundary. Fraction short and outside off, Williamson backs cuts it to third man and Aaron lets it escape right through his legs. That is now 10 runs given away for free",Thomas to Williamson,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,11.2,"Binny to Manish Pandey, FOUR, overpitched delivery at 124.6kph, Manish Pandey hammers it straight down the ground after walking down the tarck. It went between the umpire and Warner",Binny to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,14.5,"Shreyas Gopal to Manish Pandey, FOUR, shot! Brilliant use of the crease. It was the quick ball - 113.4kph - Manish Pandey made room and lifted it inside-out over extra cover for a one-bounce four",Shreyas Gopal to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,19.2,"Aaron to Bhuvneshwar, byes, FOUR, bowls the slower short ball on the stumps, Bhuvi misses on the ramp and a hint of deviation after pitching meant Samson couldn't control the pace despite the dive to his left",Aaron to Bhuvneshwar,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,19.5,"Aaron to Rashid Khan, FOUR, very full delivery outside off, Rashid set himself inside the crease and cleared his front leg while doing so, just pumped it over extra cover with disdain",Aaron to Rashid Khan,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,2.4,"Aaron to Williamson, FOUR, Williamson at his best. Pitched up outside off, no movement and Williamson creams the square drive past the diving cover-point fielder. No chance of stopping that",Aaron to Williamson,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,4.0,"Shreyas Gopal to Manish Pandey, FOUR, this is a shot of a man in confidence. He picked the wrong 'un that was a tad overpitched and lofted it straight of mid-off, superb way to open your account",Shreyas Gopal to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,4.4,"Unadkat to Manish Pandey, FOUR, Pandey already looks in his element. Slower short of length delivery and Pandey picked the length so early, short-arm jabs the pull over mid-wicket and it almost went the distance",Unadkat to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,5.5,"Thomas to Manish Pandey, FOUR, Pandey hitting through the off-side tells you he is in form. Short and just outside off, Pandey makes his own room and slaps it through the crowded off-side field",Thomas to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,7.3,"Shreyas Gopal to Manish Pandey, FOUR, nicely done. Gopal errs on the shorter side and Pandey threads the gap behind point with a delicate cut shot. He played it late and that enabled him to bisect backward point and short third man",Shreyas Gopal to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,7.4,"Shreyas Gopal to Manish Pandey, FOUR, Pandey is winning this battle against his state mate. Once again he picks the length so early, swivels deep in the crease and pulls to deep mid-wicket, beating the fielder comfortably to his right",Shreyas Gopal to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,8.4,"Riyan Parag to Manish Pandey, FOUR, Manish Pandey goes downtown! Riyan Parag slightly overpitches and the Karnataka lad takes full toll of it. Right in the slot and Pandey thumps it over the bowler's head",Riyan Parag to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9570712,SRH 1st Inns,8.5,"Riyan Parag to Manish Pandey, FOUR, fifty partnership! Parag over-corrects and bowls this too short, easy pickings for Manish Pandey. Pulled away through mid-wicket for yet another boundary",Riyan Parag to Manish Pandey,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,0.4,"U Yadav to Dhawan, FOUR, Dhawan opens his account in style. Just one sighter required for the lefty. Umesh went a tad full, Dhawan shimmied down the track and flayed it over cover-point. Raced away",U Yadav to Dhawan,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,1.4,"Washington Sundar to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, positive stroke! He doesn't want the spinner to settle in here. Gives the charge by coming down the track, wasn't anyhwere close to the pitch of the ball, but with a big swing of the bat he smashed it over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four",Washington Sundar to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,1.5,"Washington Sundar to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, back-to-back fours! A quick non-turner wide of off, Shaw stays back in the crease and scythes it hard and wide of backward point",Washington Sundar to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,10.2,"Stoinis to Dhawan, FOUR, ohh! Shikhar, you cheeky, cheeky fellow. He shuffles well wide of off, Stoinis bowls it in his area. And it was on a fuller length, the length and line was ideal for Dhawan to scoop it over short fine for a boundary",Stoinis to Dhawan,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,14.0,"Washington Sundar to Pant, FOUR, you cannot bowl short to Pant, you just cannot. Washington Sundar does the mistake and gets belted for a boundary. He picked up the length early crouched low and powers the pull shot wide of deep mid-wicket for a boundary",Washington Sundar to Pant,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,16.3,"Navdeep Saini to Ingram, FOUR, belted! This time he connects and boy doesn't he pack a punch. Good length ball outside off, Ingram shuffles across and pumps it straight back over Saini, one bounce and over the ropes",Navdeep Saini to Ingram,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,18.2,"U Yadav to Axar, FOUR, freebie and Axar helps himself to a boundary. Short and around hip height, he swivels and pulls it over short fine. Just used the pace of Umesh to fetch a one bounce four",U Yadav to Axar,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,19.0,"U Yadav to Axar, FOUR, 16 runs off the over and just what Delhi wanted. Umesh goes for the off-cutter, but he bowls it short and outside off, Axar slaps the punch through extra cover and Dube has no chance running across from sweeper cover",U Yadav to Axar,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,19.1,"Navdeep Saini to Rutherford, byes, FOUR, high full toss outside off and Rutherford can't put bat on it. Poor Parthiv Patel has no chance as the ball bounces in front of him and races away to the fence. Rutherford asks for a possible no-ball but gets nothing from the umpires. It was around waist high and might have been given on another day",Navdeep Saini to Rutherford,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,19.2,"Navdeep Saini to Rutherford, FOUR, edged and four! This is where Saini needs to learn. He bowls a pacy yorker outside off and Rutherford squirts an outside edge past Parthiv Patel. He has to take pace off on this slower surface",Navdeep Saini to Rutherford,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,19.4,"Navdeep Saini to Axar, FOUR, these runs will be hurting Bangalore. Saini is just spearing them in and missing the yorkers, another full toss and Axar looks to heave it to the leg-side, the leading edge balloons over short third man",Navdeep Saini to Axar,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,2.4,"Chahal to Dhawan, FOUR, bad ball and rightly put away by Dhawan. A drag down by Chahal and the line is down leg, Dhawan moves off-side, gets low and helps it on its way with a pull over short fine leg",Chahal to Dhawan,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,3.0,"Chahal to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, now Prithvi Shaw gets into the act. Chahal overpitches, Shaw gets down on a knee and flogs it over mid-on. Clean strike for a one-bounce four. 15 runs off the over!",Chahal to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,3.2,"U Yadav to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, that's a trademark Prithvi Shaw shot! Not a bad ball from Umesh Yadav, he bowled a length delivery around off. Shaw stayed put in his crease and punched it fiercely through point. Got it off the meat of the bat",U Yadav to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,3.4,"U Yadav to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, cross-seam ball - shortish and wide outside off. Shreyas Iyer, like Shaw, goes for the cut. But, fortunately for him, the ball went through the vacant slip region. The skipper gets off the mark in a streaky manner",U Yadav to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,4.5,"Navdeep Saini to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, 50 up for Delhi! A brilliant shot from the skipper. A fullish ball at 140.9kph, Shreyas Iyer stayed in his crease and brought his down at the right time to knock it through the gap between mid-on and mid-wicket. Superb timing",Navdeep Saini to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
8556160,DC 1st Inns,5.2,"U Yadav to Dhawan, FOUR, hammered! Fuller ball at 143.6kph, Dhawan dances down the track and biffs it down the ground - finding the gap between the umpire and Shreyas Iyer. There's no one to stop that",U Yadav to Dhawan,FOUR

8556160,RCB 1st Inns,0.5,"Ishant to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, swings one way the ball goes completely in the opposite direction. Parthiv wanted to hack to the leg-side but the thick outside edge flies over and wide of Pant",Ishant to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
8556160,RCB 1st Inns,1.0,"Ishant to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, much more like it. That is his strength. Anything slightly full and outside off, Parthiv just frees his arms and lofts it straight back over the bowler, one bounce and over the rope",Ishant to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
8556160,RCB 1st Inns,14.4,"Mishra to Stoinis, FOUR, chants of 'RCB, RCB' as soon as Stoinis thumps this one down the ground. Reaches out for the tossed up delivery and lofts it straight over the bowler's head for a clean boundary",Mishra to Stoinis,FOUR
8556160,RCB 1st Inns,16.1,"Ishant to Gurkeerat Singh, FOUR, boundary to start proceedings in the final phase of the match. Positive intent by Gurkeerat Singh. Eyes the deep square leg fence and drags the short ball away nicely. The fielder inside the circle was a touch too square and the fielder in the deep was very fine, right into the gap and that shall be four runs",Ishant to Gurkeerat Singh,FOUR
8556160,RCB 1st Inns,16.5,"Ishant to Gurkeerat Singh, FOUR, fortune favours the brave, they say. Back of a length delivery around off, Gurkeerat is a touch early as he swings across the line but the top-edge is enough to fetch him four more, with the fielder inside the circle at third man, this was bound to happen",Ishant to Gurkeerat Singh,FOUR
8556160,RCB 1st Inns,2.1,"Lamichhane to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, Lamichhane is welcomed with a boundary to the attack. The googly lands outside leg and Parthiv swings it away over square leg, just bounces inside the rope",Lamichhane to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
8556160,RCB 1st Inns,2.2,"Lamichhane to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, he's just toyed with the bowler. The fielder was moved squarer after the first boundary but this time Parthiv goes straighter with his whip, another one bounce four",Lamichhane to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
8556160,RCB 1st Inns,2.5,"Lamichhane to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, this is the best of the lot. Googly around leg-stump, Parthiv flicks it against the spin to deep mid-wicket. He played it all along the ground and still managed to beat the fielder",Lamichhane to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
8556160,RCB 1st Inns,3.1,"Rabada to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, geez! That is some shot. Pitched up outside off, Parthiv doesn't move his feet much but just drives through the line, the weight going back and the hands moving towards the ball. Nobody moved in the field as the ball rocketed past mid-off",Rabada to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
8556160,RCB 1st Inns,3.4,"Rabada to Kohli, FOUR, Kohli joins in. It was only a matter of time. This is a top shot. Good length ball around off, Kohli drives on the rise and over Parthiv at the other end. He almost cleaned him up",Rabada to Kohli,FOUR
8556160,RCB 1st Inns,4.5,"Ishant to Kohli, FOUR, this is what pressure does - a fumble from Rabada and he concedes three extra runs to Kohli - on a good length and at the stumps, Kohli nudged it in front of mid-on and charged across for a quick single - so did Rabada and he took his eyes off the ball, slipped underneath and rolled away to the fence",Ishant to Kohli,FOUR
8556160,RCB 1st Inns,5.4,"Rabada to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, cracking shot, change of pace from Rabada, it was the slower ball, but it was well wide of off, Parthiv leant forward and cracked the drive wide of mid-off, no need to run for those",Rabada to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,0.1,"Barinder to Shubman Gill, FOUR, brilliant start for the young Shubman Gill and KKR. It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps, Shubman Gill uses his wrists to perfection and flicks it wide of mid-wicket for a boundary. Outfield is lighting quick!",Barinder to Shubman Gill,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,0.2,"Barinder to Shubman Gill, FOUR, wow! This man, whatta talent. Nothing wrong with the delivery, it was on a length and around off, Shubman Gill jumps in the crease a touch, waits for it to arrive and punches it in the most amazing fashion for a boundary through cover",Barinder to Shubman Gill,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,10.1,"Bumrah to Shubman Gill, FOUR, lovely, but that was a bad misfield from the man at cover - on a good length and well outside off, Shubman leant into the drive and found cover - who let the ball go through",Bumrah to Shubman Gill,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,11.2,"Rahul Chahar to A Russell, FOUR, was it a chance? Lewis charged forward, nearly got down, dived forward and got a hand - but the ball was always dropping in front of him - can't get his body behind either and concedes a boundary",Rahul Chahar to A Russell,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,14.1,"Malinga to Shubman Gill, FOUR, drilled, length ball outside off and Shubman drilled it back at the bowler - was a chance but Malinga had little time to react, raced away across the fast outfield",Malinga to Shubman Gill,FOUR

7266994,KKR 1st Inns,14.4,"Malinga to A Russell, FOUR, slapped, on a good length and well outside off, Russell threw his bat at that, off the toe-end and races past third man - who was inside the ring. Even Malinga is leaking runs",Malinga to A Russell,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,16.0,"Hardik Pandya to A Russell, FOUR, cheeky and four, banged in short and wide as Russell was backing away - he waits on the ball and then ramps it over short third man, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes",Hardik Pandya to A Russell,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,16.3,"Bumrah to Karthik, FOUR, slower ball at 118.7kph, but Karthik picked that. It was shorter in length and the skipper had ample time to pick his spot. Stayed back and pummelled the pull over mid-wicket for a one-bounce four",Bumrah to Karthik,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,18.3,"Bumrah to A Russell, FOUR, 145.2kph, in-slanting short of length delivery, Russell moves leg-side and pulls hard. Didn't quite get it off the middle, but that's the power of this man. Races away to the deep mid-wicket fence in a jiffy",Bumrah to A Russell,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,19.2,"Malinga to A Russell, FOUR, 131.2kph, full and wide of off, Malinga misses his yorker though. Loads of width and Russell got down on a knee to batter it through the covers",Malinga to A Russell,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,19.3,"Malinga to A Russell, FOUR, ah! You gotta feel for the bowler here. A yorker length ball wide of off and Russell threw the kitchen sink at it. Gets a big under edge that hits the ground and lobs over the keeper's head",Malinga to A Russell,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,3.2,"Krunal Pandya to Chris Lynn, FOUR, Chris Lynn finally dispatches one against Krunal Pandya. It was a very full delivery and was on the stumps, Chris Lynn backs away and squeezes the drive wide of cover for a boundary",Krunal Pandya to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,3.5,"Krunal Pandya to Chris Lynn, FOUR, enough bat on it to clear the man at short fine. Chris Lynn goes down on his knees on that delivery on the stumps and slog sweeps it over short fine for a boundary",Krunal Pandya to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,4.3,"Bumrah to Chris Lynn, FOUR, Chris Lynn swings and swings hard at it. He wanted to drive it through cover, it hits the inside half of the blade and goes wide of square leg for a boundary",Bumrah to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"Malinga to Shubman Gill, FOUR, errs in line this time and Shubman Gill won't spare him. He gets in a good position and times his nudge to perfection. The outfield at Eden is a highway and it will run away for a boundary through fine leg",Malinga to Shubman Gill,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,6.0,"Malinga to Chris Lynn, FOUR, four to finish the over. And partnership between the pair is 50 now. It was a back of a length delivery around off, Chris Lynn waits for it to arrive and tonks it really hard over mid-off for a boundary",Malinga to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,6.3,"Rahul Chahar to Chris Lynn, FOUR, makes room, creates the room for himself and smashes it wide of mid-off for a boundary",Rahul Chahar to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,7.2,"Krunal Pandya to Chris Lynn, FOUR, he is hitting it really well. Again, moves away, creates room and clobbers it wide of long-off. Pollard ran to his left but fails to get there",Krunal Pandya to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,8.3,"Barinder to Chris Lynn, FOUR, he's in some mood tonight - tad too full and well wide of off, Lynn gets underneath it and then scoops it over extra-cover, one bounce and over the ropes",Barinder to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,9.0,"Barinder to Chris Lynn, FOUR, hammered, he's having a ball tonight, length ball at the stumps, Lynn clears his left leg and shovels it wide of long-on, no need to run for those",Barinder to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,0.4,"Warrier to Rohit, FOUR, Rohit gets off the mark with a boundary! Opens his bat-face at the last moment and steers this away-swinging length ball wide of the slip fielder. Neatly done",Warrier to Rohit,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,1.0,"Warrier to Rohit, FOUR, nine runs off the opening over! A harmless short ball on leg-stump line, rises up to the hip and that's easy pickings for the Mumbai captain. Rohit plays a one-legged pull shot over backward square leg for a one-bounce four",Warrier to Rohit,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,1.4,"Narine to Rohit, FOUR, once again, Rohit steps out of his crease, this time he manages to get under it and club it over wide mid-on for a boundary",Narine to Rohit,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,10.1,"Narine to Pollard, FOUR, this is the battle to watch out for. Off-break drifts on the legs and Pollard picks it away effortlessly in front of square on the leg-side, just bounced inside the rope",Narine to Pollard,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,12.5,"Gurney to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, wide full toss outside off and it's been sliced over cover-point. What a knock this is proving to be. If KKR had Russell, MI got Pandya. Two of the cleanest strikers of the cricket ball playing this match",Gurney to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,13.4,"Narine to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, full in length by Narina and Hardik Pandya hacks it into the gap at deep mid-wicket. The ball is just sailing all over the park, the fielders are going to have a neck-ache by the end of this innings",Narine to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,15.3,"Chawla to Hardik Pandya, byes, FOUR, fires this one at 120ks around off and beats both the batsman and the wicket-keeper. Frustration creeping in and that delivery by Chawla says it all",Chawla to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,15.4,"Chawla to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, floated outside off and Hardik has chipped it over covers for four runs, runs are leaking as Pandya brothers are having some fun out in the middle",Chawla to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,15.5,"Chawla to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, hammered! Things going worse for Chawla who has now conceded 48 runs. Another floated delivery outside off and Hardik slams it through the gap at covers. Hardik's looking unstoppable",Chawla to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,16.1,"Narine to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, Hardik is in some pain but he's keeping the scoreboard ticking. Smacking 'em all over! Goes down on his knee and bludgeons it right over the bowler's head for a boundary",Narine to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,17.4,"Gurney to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, into his 90s is Hardik! Full in length outside off and Hardik chips it over covers for four more. Amazing display of batting by Pandya",Gurney to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,5.1,"Gurney to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, just can't bowl straight to Suryakumar. The slower delivery drifts with the round the wicket angle, flicked away with a lot of bottom hand in front of square, beating the fielder in the deep comfortably",Gurney to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,5.5,"Gurney to Lewis, FOUR, full delivery and Lewis picked the bones out of that. It was in the slot and Lewis lofted it through the line ovr extra cover, couple of bounces and into the rope",Gurney to Lewis,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,7.0,"A Russell to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, sloppy from Chawla. Russell will not be a happy man. It was a brilliant over until this misfield. Back of a length outside off, Suryakumar steers it to third man and Chawla is all over the place with his dive, the ball just escapes past him",A Russell to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7266994,MI 1st Inns,9.5,"Chawla to Pollard, FOUR, googly but on the shorter length, Pollard does not go hell for leather, slides on the back foot and crunches it square on the off-side, no chance for a diving sweeper cover",Chawla to Pollard,FOUR
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,0.5,"Khaleel Ahmed to Gayle, FOUR, Gayle opens his account with a boundary. That was no where close to the middle of his bat though, it came off the cue end. A length delivery outside off, Gayle goes hard at the first ball he faces and as a courtesy of the power on that shot gets a four through square third man, that was in the air for a while but well over the fielder inside the circle",Khaleel Ahmed to Gayle,FOUR
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,1.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, FOUR, quite an edgy start for the Kings. Rahul goes for an expensive drive against an outswinger and gets a thick outside edge. The ball flies over Guptill at wide slip and races away to the fence. Both batsmen have scored a boundaries but they haven't been convincing ones",Bhuvneshwar to Rahul,FOUR
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,10.2,"Khaleel Ahmed to Pooran, FOUR, smashed! This is an excellent shot. On a length and on the stumps, Pooran uses a straight bat and tonks it straight down the ground. It rockets to the fence",Khaleel Ahmed to Pooran,FOUR
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,10.4,"Khaleel Ahmed to Pooran, FOUR, another boundary from Pooran. He is putting on a show here for Punjab. It was a slower one and was wide of off, Pooran goes down on his knees and sweeps it through fine leg for a boundary. Great connection!",Khaleel Ahmed to Pooran,FOUR
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,12.1,"Rashid Khan to Miller, FOUR, freebie and Miller puts it away. Need to make this into a big over now. Long hop and Miller had ample time to pick his spot, rocked back and pulled it in front of square",Rashid Khan to Miller,FOUR
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,15.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, FOUR, knuckle ball and Rahul smokes it over extra cover. He made room and generated enough power to take it over Williamson, the ball bounced just inside the rope",Bhuvneshwar to Rahul,FOUR
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,18.5,"Khaleel Ahmed to Simran Singh, FOUR, slower delivery combined with width, Simran flays it behind point and bisected the fielders expertly",Khaleel Ahmed to Simran Singh,FOUR
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,3.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Agarwal, FOUR, deft touch! On the pads and Agarwal clips it past the fielder at short fine leg. The fielder in the deep was very square in order to cut this down",Sandeep Sharma to Agarwal,FOUR
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,3.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Rahul, FOUR, all about class! Down on his knee early and picks the slower delivery over fine leg for a boundary. Was the slower delivery and Rahul played the lap shot to perfecion. Almost got a six as the ball hit the cushions on a boundary",Sandeep Sharma to Rahul,FOUR
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,6.5,"Abhishek Sharma to Agarwal, FOUR, Rashid lost in the lights there. And he has allowed it to go for a boundary. Agarwal rocks back and thumps it straight to sweeper cover. Rashid should have stopped it on the bounce but instead he lets it go and gifts a boundary to Kings",Abhishek Sharma to Agarwal,FOUR
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,7.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Rahul, FOUR, Rahul is flowing like a river. He is timing the ball so very well. But the required rate demands more out of this. It was a slower one on the stumps, Rahul flicks it handsomely, beats fine leg and it races to the fence",Sandeep Sharma to Rahul,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,0.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, FOUR, erratic and Warner puts it away this time. Arshdeep strayed on the pads once more with this pacy inswinger, the southpaw just had to get bat on it and he tickled it past the keeper. Fine leg was quite squarer and had no chance",Arshdeep Singh to Warner,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,0.5,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, FOUR, this is poor bowling from Arshdeep after a good start. Once again errs in line, feeds it down leg and Warner takes full toll of this inswinger. Fine is up in the ring and this is clipped fine enough. All too easy",Arshdeep Singh to Warner,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,10.3,"Murugan Ashwin to Manish Pandey, FOUR, delicate hands from Pandey. Ashwin pulls his length and feeds him with width outside off, Pandey goes deep in his crease and opens his bat face at the last moment to place it in the gap past point. The timing is flawless and the sweeper in the deep had no chance",Murugan Ashwin to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,11.2,"Shami to Warner, FOUR, fifty for Warner. It's most likely his last game for the season and he wants to finish on a high. Shorter and wobbled away just outside off, Warner waited deep and slashed at it, thick outside edge runs away to the third man fence. SRH dug-out up on their feet and Warner acknowledges them with a raise of the bat",Shami to Warner,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,13.4,"Mujeeb to Warner, FOUR, There's the trademark switch-hit from Warner. Flighted full just outside off, Warner changes his stance and lifts it over short third man. He was itching to play this shot for a while, does so now..",Mujeeb to Warner,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,14.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Warner, FOUR, well, the plan was good from Arshdeep, but the execution part went wrong. Swerving in, tried for the yorker but missed by a few inches. Ends up as a low full toss on the pads for Warner, who gets across and flicks it past Gayle at short fine leg. Cricket can be cruel sometimes, ain't it?",Arshdeep Singh to Warner,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,14.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Manish Pandey, FOUR, this is poor from the youngster. Nah, nah, not where you bowl with fine leg inside the ring. Went for the bouncer, but didn't quite hit his target. Pandey gets on top of it and pulls it over short fine leg for a boundary",Arshdeep Singh to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,17.1,"Mujeeb to Williamson, FOUR, what has Gayle done there? He's kicked that ball away to the boundary. Went for the chase from short third man and ends up kicking it away to the fence. Williamson went hard at this one as the thick outside edge flew over the fielders at short third and backward point",Mujeeb to Williamson,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,19.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Abhishek Sharma, FOUR, that's a crispy drive by Abhishek Sharma! An overpitched delivery outside off and the southpaw creams it through extra cover. Miller in the deep sprinted across and although he put in a dive, he couldn't quite stop the ball, four runs for the young batsman",Arshdeep Singh to Abhishek Sharma,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,2.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Saha, FOUR, heaved over mid-wicket! Looked ungainly from Saha but he's managed to clear the infield with ease. Was a length ball, picked from outside off and lobbed with a heave across the line",Arshdeep Singh to Saha,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,3.0,"Arshdeep Singh to Saha, byes, FOUR, bonus runs! It's an IPL debut for Simran Singh and this won't do much to his confidence, that's for sure. Was a slower ball from Arshdeep and Saha wanted to hoick across the line. Got beaten by the lack of pace and it went on the bounce to Simran Singh who just couldn't cover the line as it sneaked past him to the fence. Don't want to be gifting easy runs to the opposition, not in such high-pressure games",Arshdeep Singh to Saha,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,3.2,"Mujeeb to Warner, FOUR, Warner is having fun! Slower and fuller, he just shuffles a bit and slog sweeps merrily over backward square leg. Clean strike and it races away to the fence",Mujeeb to Warner,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,3.3,"Mujeeb to Warner, FOUR, this is superb batting! He's toying with the field, Warner. Makes a bit of room to the loopy off break and goes with the turn on this chip over extra cover. Another clean connection and the boundaries continue to rain here in Hyderabad",Mujeeb to Warner,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,4.0,"Mujeeb to Saha, FOUR, fastest fifty partnership in IPL 2019! SRH are on rampage here! Saha joins in the fun with a lovely paddle sweep, the line was too straight from Mujeeb and it was helped away quite fine. Well wide of short fine leg who could do nothing",Mujeeb to Saha,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,4.5,"Shami to Saha, FOUR, sublime from Saha! He's looking in great touch tonight, isn't he? Too full from Shami and it's been drop kicked over wide mid-on. Supple stuff and easily over the infield",Shami to Saha,FOUR
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,7.5,"Ashwin to Manish Pandey, FOUR, superb shot! Pandey is in some form and this shot is a reflection of it. Ashwin went wide of the crease to cut off room but Pandey backed away a touch to drive this inside out through extra cover. Bisected the deep fielders well",Ashwin to Manish Pandey,FOUR
3495290,RCB 1st Inns,0.4,"Aaron to de Villiers, FOUR, de Villiers is off the mark with a boundary. Streaky but he'll take it. Length delivery that gained some extra bounce, ABD flashes his bat and ends up getting a thick outside edge that beats short third man. Aaron can't believe his luck, got to feel for him",Aaron to de Villiers,FOUR
3495290,RCB 1st Inns,1.0,"Aaron to de Villiers, FOUR, one bounce and over the ropes. 23 have come off the opening over. Went fuller, aimed at the stumps and de Villiers made room. Cleared his front leg and blasts it over cow corner. The fielder in the deep gave up the chase..",Aaron to de Villiers,FOUR
3495290,RCB 1st Inns,1.2,"Shreyas Gopal to Kohli, FOUR, oh my word! He's hammered it past mid-off. What a hit. Gopal went quicker and fired it outside off, Kohli gets under it and drills it with ferocity down the ground",Shreyas Gopal to Kohli,FOUR
3495290,RCB 1st Inns,2.4,"Riyan Parag to Gurkeerat Singh, FOUR, what happened there? Pushed through flatter down leg, Mann sinks low and is a bit early into the shot. Gets a top-edge which balloons away to the fine leg fence",Riyan Parag to Gurkeerat Singh,FOUR
3495290,RCB 1st Inns,3.2,"Unadkat to Parthiv Patel, FOUR, he's been pushed down the order but Patel is off and running. Slower delivery from Unadkat, reared up a touch and Patel was through the pull early. Fat top-edge loops over short fine leg and trickles away to the boundary",Unadkat to Parthiv Patel,FOUR
3495290,RCB 1st Inns,4.4,"Thomas to Negi, FOUR, edged and four! Handy boundary for Negi and RCB. Thomas bombarded it short, hustles Negi for pace as he hooks. Top-edge is found and it sails over Samson",Thomas to Negi,FOUR
3495290,RR 1st Inns,0.3,"U Yadav to Samson, FOUR, poor ball! The line is too straight, ends up bowling the length ball on the pads and that's easy pickings for any batter. Samson helps it on its way with a flick through the gap between short fine and backward square leg",U Yadav to Samson,FOUR
3495290,RR 1st Inns,1.1,"Navdeep Saini to Livingstone, FOUR, skiddy and pacy back of a length delivery at 152.4kph, Livingstone sees that coming. Clears his front leg and heaves it hard and over mid-wicket. Couple of bounces and into the fence",Navdeep Saini to Livingstone,FOUR
3495290,RR 1st Inns,3.0,"Khejroliya to Samson, FOUR, edged and four! Away-angler at 136.4kph, Samson throws the kitchen sink and gets a thick outside edge that runs away through the gap between the keeper and short third man",Khejroliya to Samson,FOUR
5442968,CSK 1st Inns,12.0,"Mishra to Raina, FOUR, just over Morris. Lands the wrong 'un outside leg, Raina is down on his knee to play the sweep, waits for the ball to turn across and helps it over a leaping Morris",Mishra to Raina,FOUR
5442968,CSK 1st Inns,14.1,"J Suchith to Raina, FOUR, not where he intended but Raina will take the final result. He went down to play the slog sweep, but dragged it off the inner half of the bat to cow corner - bisecting deep mid-wicket and long-on",J Suchith to Raina,FOUR
5442968,CSK 1st Inns,14.2,"J Suchith to Raina, FOUR, fifty for Raina. It is his 50th fifty in all of T20 cricket. He gets there with a fabulous shot. Charges down the wicket, reached out for the delivery and pumped it over Suchith, couple of bounces and over the rope",J Suchith to Raina,FOUR
5442968,CSK 1st Inns,16.0,"Axar to Jadeja, FOUR, charges down and Axar makes him reach out by firing it outside off, Jadeja still goes through with the big hit and the outside edge flies away fine, beating Pant to his left",Axar to Jadeja,FOUR
5442968,CSK 1st Inns,16.3,"Chris Morris to Dhoni, FOUR, finds the gap this time. Not a lot wrong with this delivery, it was a slower one and was on the stumps. Dhoni picks it up early, swivels and pulls it wide of fine leg for a boundray. Sweet connection! First boundary for MS in this innings, this might get him going!",Chris Morris to Dhoni,FOUR
5442968,CSK 1st Inns,16.5,"Chris Morris to Jadeja, FOUR, he is playing a cameo here, is Jaddu. It was an off-cutter, there was just a little bit room. Jadeja waits for it to arrive, opens the face of the blade at the last moment and guides it wide of short third man for a boundary. Exemplary placement!",Chris Morris to Jadeja,FOUR
5442968,CSK 1st Inns,17.2,"Boult to Dhoni, FOUR, you cannot bowl short with fine leg up in the circle. Dhoni knows where the fielders are and he pulls it over fine leg. The connection was good enough and it runs for a boundary",Boult to Dhoni,FOUR
5442968,CSK 1st Inns,18.1,"Chris Morris to Dhoni, FOUR, not where Dhoni wanted it to go but he will take it with both hands at this stage of the innings. It was on a fuller length and was attacking the stumps, Dhoni swings his willow hard. He gets a thick inside edge and it beats short fine for a boundary",Chris Morris to Dhoni,FOUR
5442968,CSK 1st Inns,18.4,"Chris Morris to Rayudu, FOUR, he doesn't want to get his eye in, does Rayudu. It was in the slot for Rayudu and he smashes it over deep mid-wicket. Not timed as well as he would have liked. So, it didn't go over the ropes but will fetch him a boundary",Chris Morris to Rayudu,FOUR
5442968,CSK 1st Inns,19.3,"Boult to Dhoni, FOUR, check for a spark on the bat! Wow that was hit hard! Hard is an understatement of the highest order. It was a yorker on the stumps. Dhoni was standing deep in the crease, he gets under it and pumps it straight down the ground. It rockets to the fence!",Boult to Dhoni,FOUR
5442968,CSK 1st Inns,4.2,"Chris Morris to du Plessis, FOUR, low full-toss on leg-stump, easy pickings, just a deflection away towards the fine leg fence for four - CSK's first boundary comes after 26 balls",Chris Morris to du Plessis,FOUR

5442968,CSK 1st Inns,5.4,"Axar to Raina, FOUR, skids through low, a tad short, Raina gets low and carves it away through the gap between cover point and backward point for four - bisected perfectly. Surgical precision",Axar to Raina,FOUR

5442968,CSK 1st Inns,8.5,"Chris Morris to du Plessis, FOUR, hit-me delivery and du Plessis does not miss out. Slow, short and down leg, du Plessis swivels and helps it along the way to fine leg.

5442968,DC 1st Inns,0.2,"Chahar to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, misses his length and misses his line too. It ends up being a half-volley on the pads, Prithvi Shaw flicks it wide of fine leg for a boundary",Chahar to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
5442968,DC 1st Inns,1.0,"Chahar to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, down the leg-side and Shreyas Iyer clips it fine of fine leg for a boundary. Nice way to get off the mark!",Chahar to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
5442968,DC 1st Inns,15.3,"Dwayne Bravo to Mishra, FOUR, rare boundary for Delhi. Loosener from Bravo, drifting it on the pads, Mishra shuffles across and whips it off his legs behind square. Splits the gap between deep square leg and fine leg to perfection",Dwayne Bravo to Mishra,FOUR
5442968,DC 1st Inns,2.2,"Chahar to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, width available on this delivery, Shreyas Iyer makes full use of the room and punches it wide of deep backward point for a boundary",Chahar to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
5442968,DC 1st Inns,3.5,"Harbhajan to Dhawan, FOUR, finds the gap again. He has taken a liking to Bhajji. It was full and was wide of off, Dhawan plunges forward and creams it wide of cover. The placement was good as it beats the deep cover fielder into the fence",Harbhajan to Dhawan,FOUR
5442968,DC 1st Inns,4.5,"Chahar to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, short of length delivery close to off, Iyer arches back and ramps it over short third man. This is superb from Iyer who's got off to a flier",Chahar to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR

6119894,MI 1st Inns,0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit, FOUR, that's a horrible start for Thampi in this year's IPL. He gifts a boundary to Rohit who won't mind this at all. He opened the face of the bat for a single, Thampi was casual in getting down at third man. It goes through him for a boundary",Bhuvneshwar to Rohit,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,1.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Rohit, FOUR, when you can hit on the up in that manner than deduce it's a belter of a wicket to bat on. Rohit charges forward, transforms the length into a fuller one and just eases it through cover. The timing was stellar and it raced off the bat and reached the fence in some micro seconds!",Bhuvneshwar to Rohit,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,1.3,"Khaleel Ahmed to Rohit, FOUR, how easy does he make it look. Trademark of a class batsman! It was on a good length and was angling away from Rohit who leans into it and flays into the drive wide of cover like a boss. It beats the cover fielder and canters to the fence",Khaleel Ahmed to Rohit,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,1.5,"Khaleel Ahmed to Rohit, FOUR, tell you what this is a batsman's paradise! Just a hint of room for Rohit, it was a slower one too. Rohit waits for it to arrive, adjusts his bat-swing brilliantly and guides it wide of backward point. This outfield = National highway and third man had no realistic chance of stopping that",Khaleel Ahmed to Rohit,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,13.4,"Basil Thampi to de Kock, FOUR, muscled over mid-wicket and de Kock manages to find the gap. Didn't time it as he would've liked as it kicked off rapidly off the deck. de Kock got it high on the bat, enough to beat long-on",Basil Thampi to de Kock,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,14.0,"Basil Thampi to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, a boundary to cap off the over. 16 off it. Short and hint of width provided, Hardik exploits it by riding the bounce and spanks it crisply through extra cover. No long-off and Hardik collects four",Basil Thampi to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,16.3,"Basil Thampi to de Kock, FOUR, attempted yorker length delivery, errs on the fuller side, de Kock backs away into the on-side and gets low to slice it away behind point for four - his 4th fifty for the Mumbai Indians this season, and he raises the bat to the dressing room. A good recovery from him after a slow start. Can he finish off with a flourish?",Basil Thampi to de Kock,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,17.5,"Rashid Khan to de Kock, FOUR, fired down leg, de Kock is late on the expansive fine sweep, gets some bat on it though, and gets it away to the fine leg fence for four",Rashid Khan to de Kock,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,2.0,"Khaleel Ahmed to Rohit, FOUR, another boundary to finish the over. Rohit is off to a flyer here. It was on a short of length and was wide of off, Rohit powers the pull shot wide of mid-on, Nabi puts in a valiant effort there by chasing it down. He puts in a dive too but his foot was touching the ropes when ball was in his contact and that will be signalled as a boundary",Khaleel Ahmed to Rohit,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,3.2,"Bhuvneshwar to de Kock, FOUR, Bhuvneshwar strays on the pads and de Kock punishes. All de Kock had to do was to beat the short fine fiedler which he did with ease with the flick shot, and it raced to the fence",Bhuvneshwar to de Kock,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,3.3,"Bhuvneshwar to de Kock, FOUR, de Kock joins the party too. It was slower one a short of length, de Kock swivels, gets in a terrific posiition and thumps it wide of deep backward square leg for a boundary.",Bhuvneshwar to de Kock,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,5.3,"Khaleel Ahmed to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, shot mahn! Suryakumar Yadav has this unique way of pulling the ball. It was around the hip-height, Suryakumar Yadav swivels and powers the pull shot wide of short fine leg for a boundary",Khaleel Ahmed to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,6.0,"Khaleel Ahmed to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, class written all over it! It was on a good length and was wide of off, Suryakumar Yadav drives it like a boss, places it well and it runs along the carpet",Khaleel Ahmed to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,6.4,"Nabi to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, he has bisected the gap between long on and cow corner to perfection!

He has started really well!",Nabi to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
6119894,MI 1st Inns,7.5,"Basil Thampi to de Kock, FOUR, he has placed it to perfection!

6119894,SRH 1st Inns,11.0,"Rahul Chahar to Manish Pandey, FOUR, the boundary releases all the pressure Chahar built up. Poor bit of work from Anukul Roy. It was on the shorter side and Pandey pulled it to deep square leg, Roy was late to spot the ball and by the time he did and put in the dive, it was too late",Rahul Chahar to Manish Pandey,FOUR
6119894,SRH 1st Inns,11.2,"Krunal Pandya to Manish Pandey, FOUR, consecutive boundaries for Pandey. Once again the length is wrong - on the shorter side, Pandey makes room and slaps the cut in front of square, no chance for Sran coming across from sweeper cover",Krunal Pandya to Manish Pandey,FOUR
6119894,SRH 1st Inns,16.0,"Malinga to Manish Pandey, FOUR, Manish Pandey responds in style; keeps his head still and smashes the straight drive past the non-striker, that was timed to perfection and no-one's gonna stop that",Malinga to Manish Pandey,FOUR
6119894,SRH 1st Inns,16.5,"Bumrah to Nabi, FOUR, sits on the back foot this time, expects the length to be short and swivels into his pull in a flash. Placed it in the gap behind square and that's Nabi's first boundary",Bumrah to Nabi,FOUR
6119894,SRH 1st Inns,17.2,"Malinga to Nabi, FOUR, slice of luck for Nabi and SRH. Malinga executes another yorker outside off and Nabi swung himself (quite literally) into that, managed to get a thick inside edge which flies past QDK to his left",Malinga to Nabi,FOUR
6119894,SRH 1st Inns,18.5,"Bumrah to Manish Pandey, FOUR, a rare bad ball from Bumrah and Manish Pandey takes full toll of it. On seeing Pandey shuffle forward, Bumrah loses his length and feeds a full toss at the body, Pandey knows where the gap is and he swats it for a one-bounce boundary over square leg",Bumrah to Manish Pandey,FOUR
6119894,SRH 1st Inns,19.0,"Bumrah to Manish Pandey, FOUR, Manish Pandey thinks it's a no-ball for height, but wasn't to be. A fair call from the umpire as it was clearly below waist.

6119894,SRH 1st Inns,2.3,"Barinder to Saha, FOUR, short and wide, a slash at that, and just wide of a diving Rahul Chahar at backward point for four. Saha is away. The confidence reflects in his conviction of the shots and his footwork.",Barinder to Saha,FOUR

Hopefully, he hasn't hurt himself",Bumrah to Saha,FOUR
6119894,SRH 1st Inns,4.2,"Malinga to Manish Pandey, FOUR, confidence, I tell you is a very big thing in sport. First ball and Pandey has put it away for a boundary. Not a bad delivery - short of length angled at the body, Pandey elevated himself and pulled it past the diving mid-wicket fielder. The timing was spot on",Malinga to Manish Pandey,FOUR
6119894,SRH 1st Inns,4.5,"Malinga to Manish Pandey, FOUR, this is poor bowling. Even the experienced Malinga feeling the heat. Sprays it down leg and all Pandey had to do was place it in the gap, tickled fine and the fielder at 45 had no chance",Malinga to Manish Pandey,FOUR
6119894,SRH 1st Inns,6.1,"Rahul Chahar to Manish Pandey, FOUR, Pandey keeps dealing in boundaries. He waits for the leg-break to arrive and dabs it past Rohit at slip, placed it fine enough and beat Bumrah behind square on the off-side",Rahul Chahar to Manish Pandey,FOUR
7588426,KKR 1st Inns,11.4,"Sam Curran to A Russell, FOUR, bangs the slower delivery into the surface, Russell waits and waits some more to play the flat-batted hit, strikes it square on the off-side and leaves sweeper with no chance",Sam Curran to A Russell,FOUR
7588426,KKR 1st Inns,12.5,"Ashwin to Shubman Gill, FOUR, another quick skidder outside off, sliced away to the third man boundary for four, bringing up another fifty for Gill as an opener - further accentuating the fact that bringing him in down low was always a bad idea",Ashwin to Shubman Gill,FOUR

7588426,KKR 1st Inns,18.0,"Sam Curran to Karthik, FOUR, that's that, then! KKR live to fight another day, and as do KXIP, who need far too many results to go their way.

7588426,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Shami to Shubman Gill, FOUR, that ball had no right to go to the fence. It was just touched by Shubman Gill on the whip but the timing was extraordinary and it raced off his blade. It beats the man at mid-on and canters to the fence",Shami to Shubman Gill,FOUR
7588426,KKR 1st Inns,3.2,"Arshdeep Singh to Chris Lynn, FOUR, this one surely hit the sweet spot. And it has reached the fence like a tracer-bullet!

7588426,KKR 1st Inns,3.3,"Arshdeep Singh to Chris Lynn, FOUR, gee! That has been smashed. Chris Lynn looks in his elements today, ominous signs for Kings.

7588426,KKR 1st Inns,3.4,"Arshdeep Singh to Chris Lynn, FOUR, flurry of boundaries for Lynn. And KKR are off to a sensational start. It was a short of length on the pads, Chris Lynn pulls it wide of the keeper for a boundary",Arshdeep Singh to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7588426,KKR 1st Inns,4.1,"Ashwin to Chris Lynn, FOUR, edged and four! Lynn won't mind it. Ashwin starts with a carrom ball, Lynn makes room and swings through the line, the outside edge runs away fine to the third man fence",Ashwin to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7588426,KKR 1st Inns,5.1,"Tye to Shubman Gill, FOUR, poor start from Tye. He needs to be better than that. Back of a length and on the hips, Gill does nothing fancy, whips it with a strong bottom hand backward of square, no chance for the fielder in the deep",Tye to Shubman Gill,FOUR
7588426,KKR 1st Inns,5.5,"Tye to Chris Lynn, FOUR, yes, it is his night. Now an inside edge escapes past the stumps to reach the fence. Good length ball and Lynn backs away to swing across the line, the edge evades leg-stump and races to fine leg",Tye to Chris Lynn,FOUR
7588426,KKR 1st Inns,8.2,"Murugan Ashwin to Uthappa, FOUR, oh no! Rahul has let one go right through his legs. Drifting on the legs and Uthappa whips it powerfully to wide long-on, Rahul gets there but allows it to escape past him. That should get Uthappa going",Murugan Ashwin to Uthappa,FOUR
7588426,KKR 1st Inns,8.4,"Murugan Ashwin to Uthappa, FOUR, that is the Uthappa of old. Put the bowler under pressure and then toy with him.

7588426,KKR 1st Inns,9.3,"Sam Curran to Shubman Gill, FOUR, top shot! Nothing much wrong with the delivery. Cutter on a length, Gill stands tall and drives on the rise past mid-off, the timing he generated on the slower ball was just amazing",Sam Curran to Shubman Gill,FOUR

7588426,KXIP 1st Inns,1.0,"Warrier to Gayle, FOUR, 141.5kph. Another juicy overcook.

7588426,KXIP 1st Inns,12.4,"Warrier to Mandeep, FOUR, smart cricket from Mandeep Singh! Sits deep inside for the slower ball and steers it with the finest of touches at the last minute in the gap between the keeper and short third",Warrier to Mandeep,FOUR

7588426,KXIP 1st Inns,2.4,"Warrier to Agarwal, FOUR, dishes out width outside off, and it's just too short as well. There may be a gully and a backward point, but Agarwal lines up really well, opening up and delaying his cut to bisect those two",Warrier to Agarwal,FOUR

7588426,KXIP 1st Inns,4.5,"Warrier to Pooran, FOUR, 140.7kph. There's the crunch. Warrier gets a little too greedy, going short without a lot of pace and Pooran's ready for it, bringing out a short arm jab to smack it into cow corner",Warrier to Pooran,FOUR
7588426,KXIP 1st Inns,6.4,"A Russell to Pooran, FOUR, 130kph, a long hop, and a lucky edge. Pooran tries swivelling on a pull intended through mid-wicket, but ends up with a toe-end, running through the slips - the empty slips",A Russell to Pooran,FOUR

5231019,DC 1st Inns,3.0,"Thomas to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, that's a loosener from Thomas. He's not finished it well as Shaw tucks in a four. Angled it down leg, fine was inside the ring and Shaw glances it past the man at 45",Thomas to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
5231019,DC 1st Inns,6.0,"Ish Sodhi to Pant, FOUR, pressure-releasing over from Sodhi. After a great opening over where he picked up two wickets for no run, he leaks 17 in his second. Drags it too short, Pant was quick to pick the length as he pivots back and bashes it through extra cover. This outfield is very quick and there's no stopping those",Ish Sodhi to Pant,FOUR

6649951,RCB 1st Inns,0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Kohli, FOUR, looks like go big or go home for RCB. That seems to be the philosophy for them. Kohli gets into business rightaway.

6649951,RCB 1st Inns,1.1,"Khaleel Ahmed to Kohli, FOUR, drilled ferociously past mid-off. That should dent Ahmed's confidence. Pitches it up outside off, it's a tasty half-volley and Kohli gets into the act, hammering it past mid-off",Khaleel Ahmed to Kohli,FOUR

6649951,SRH 1st Inns,5.0,"Navdeep Saini to Guptill, FOUR, cracking shot, short of a length and just outside off, Guptill made room for himself and clattered it over cover, no one moved and that brings up SRH's 50",Navdeep Saini to Guptill,FOUR
6649951,SRH 1st Inns,6.1,"Khejroliya to Manish Pandey, FOUR, crisp, length ball and well outside off, Manish leans into the drive, plays it on the up and past the fielder at mid-off, nice way to get going",Khejroliya to Manish Pandey,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,1.0,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, FOUR, that should make him feel better. Brar errs in his line here - just outside off and Watson is quick to latch on, he moves back in the crease and caresses the punch through cover-point. All timing!",Harpreet Brar to Watson,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,1.1,"Shami to du Plessis, FOUR, gift from Shami and du Plessis accepts it gleefully. Good length ball on the pads, he leans forward and clips it neatly past the square leg umpire, the quick outfield does the rest",Shami to du Plessis,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,10.3,"Murugan Ashwin to du Plessis, FOUR, du Plessis puts his dancing shoes on and lifts it over the bowler's head. Such clean hitting, holds his shape and earns a boundary. The key was he picked the length and met the pitch at the right time, then his fast hands taking over to execute the shot. It bounces just inside the ad cushions",Murugan Ashwin to du Plessis,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,10.5,"Murugan Ashwin to du Plessis, FOUR, oh, that's sloppy from KL Rahul. School-boyish error as he fails to get his body behind the line and lets it through his legs. du Plessis shaved it towards long-on, KL Rahul moves across to his right and perhaps took his eyes off the ball completely. Don't even look at your skipper, KL..",Murugan Ashwin to du Plessis,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,11.2,"Tye to Raina, FOUR, appaling from Tye. Splays it on leg-stump, Raina is clever as he moves inside the line and tucks it fine. Harpreet from fine leg was slightly squarer and despite his dive, the ball runs away to the fence",Tye to Raina,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,14.2,"Murugan Ashwin to Raina, FOUR, bisects the gap on this occasion. Raina reaches his fifty, up goes the bat as well. Similar delivery from Ashwin, getting too predictable as Raina lines up and smashes it in the gap between deep mid-wicket and long-on",Murugan Ashwin to Raina,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,14.4,"Murugan Ashwin to du Plessis, FOUR, he's changing his gears now. Runs down the track, takes this floater on the full and drills it straight down the ground",Murugan Ashwin to du Plessis,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,15.1,"Tye to du Plessis, FOUR, bullied through extra cover. The intentions are clear from du Plessis. Knuckle ball, on a fuller length outside off. du Plessis sets a solid base and crunches it wide of long-off",Tye to du Plessis,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,15.2,"Tye to du Plessis, FOUR, back-to-back fours. It's been raining boundaries in the last few overs. Tye digs it short, sits up emphatically for du Plessis as he nails the pull in front of square on the leg-side",Tye to du Plessis,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,2.1,"Sam Curran to du Plessis, FOUR, shot! Just a mere push and the ball races away. Full and angled across off, du Plessis eases with a forward extension past the bowler and the timing takes care of the rest",Sam Curran to du Plessis,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,4.0,"Shami to du Plessis, FOUR, the pressure is released with a low full toss. Shami went for the yorker and did not get it right, du Plessis flicks it past the mid-wicket fielder and once it passes the inner ring, there is no stopping that",Shami to du Plessis,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,4.5,"Sam Curran to du Plessis, FOUR, lovely shot! Good use of the feet. He left the crease and did not allow Curran to change his length, right in the slot and he creams the drive straight down the ground",Sam Curran to du Plessis,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,5.4,"Ashwin to Raina, FOUR, fraction short and Raina is quick to pounce on that, he rocks back and nails the pull in front of square, couple of bounces and into the fence",Ashwin to Raina,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,7.1,"Ashwin to Raina, FOUR, neatly done! He waits and the ball was outside off, dabs it past Gayle at slip and the chasing fielder had no chance. Raced away..",Ashwin to Raina,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,9.2,"Tye to du Plessis, FOUR, fabulous shot! Good length ball outside off, du Plessis stays his ground and lofts it handsomely over extra cover, just an extension of the arms and the connection was exquisite",Tye to du Plessis,FOUR
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,9.4,"Tye to Raina, FOUR, poor bowling. Offers width outside off and Raina places it expertly, he waits for the ball to arrive and steers it behind point - between short third man and backward point",Tye to Raina,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,1.1,"Harbhajan to Gayle, FOUR, well this is no Chepauk .. Bhajji tries spinning one across from a leg-line, alas, it goes straight on for an easy flick right through square leg",Harbhajan to Gayle,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,10.5,"Harbhajan to Agarwal, FOUR, flat one angled into middle and leg, Agarwal gets low and swats a sweep away to backward square leg for four",Harbhajan to Agarwal,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,13.4,"Dwayne Bravo to Pooran, FOUR, half-volley right in the slot, Pooran doesn't need to get forward just leans into it with the powerful forearms and thrashes it through deep extra cover for four",Dwayne Bravo to Pooran,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,14.4,"Jadeja to Pooran, FOUR, another one dropped short, Pooran gets his weight onto the backfoot and smokes the pull to the long-on fence for four",Jadeja to Pooran,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,15.2,"Tahir to Pooran, byes, FOUR, yorker length delivery, Pooran tries squeezing it away, nutmegs Dhoni to the long stop fence for four byes",Tahir to Pooran,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,18.0,"Tahir to Sam Curran, FOUR, all over! Bittersweet win for KXIP at home to finish off the season, as they manage to avoid the wooden spoon - that was to be RCB's destiny this time. It's a very full ball that's swatted over mid-on to the boundary for four to seal a consolation win for KXIP",Tahir to Sam Curran,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,2.1,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR, the yorker goes wrong. Just an inch too full, just a degree too leg-sided and Rahul has easy pickings, flicking it perfectly behind square",Chahar to Rahul,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,2.3,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR, 115.9kph, it's a larget buffet. Chahar tries overcorrecting, goes short, on the hips and swats don't really get any easier - whacking it once again into fine leg",Chahar to Rahul,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,3.1,"Harbhajan to Rahul, FOUR, full toss. Rahul's cleared out his front leg, laying into it with a fierce cover drive. Bravo - at mid-off - is right there, but he charges at it and his old back is really slow in bending down in time, misfields",Harbhajan to Rahul,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,3.2,"Harbhajan to Rahul, FOUR, and now Harbhajan overcompensates with the drag down. Rahul rocks behind, pumping the pull over mid-wicket",Harbhajan to Rahul,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,3.3,"Harbhajan to Rahul, FOUR, oops. Harbhajan and no-Chepauk is a turning into a nightmare. H continues to keep it short, and Rahul continues heaving them mercilessly into cow corner",Harbhajan to Rahul,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,5.4,"Dwayne Bravo to Rahul, leg byes, FOUR, hmmm, slips into the thighs, and the thighs are good enough to nudge them away fine, certainly helps his cause when fine leg's inside the ring",Dwayne Bravo to Rahul,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,6.4,"Tahir to Gayle, FOUR, wide full toss. Gayle, thankfully, holds his shape, quietly relying on placing it through the cover gap. And the gap's good enough",Tahir to Gayle,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,8.5,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR, walking swat, utterly outrageous. Rahul - clearly with no respect - walks down the pitch and then rocks onto the front foot to pull it so damn neatly to bisect deep mid-wicket and long-on",Chahar to Rahul,FOUR
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,9.0,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR, more grace, and rubbed in with more CSK misery. A very short arm drill, leaning back and generating a lot of power to pump it just in front of long-off's ropes",Chahar to Rahul,FOUR
1849030,KKR 1st Inns,13.5,"Bumrah to Uthappa, FOUR, needed, much needed. KKR will take them any which way. Backed away and created the room to get the bat swing, carved behind point and the pace Bumrah is enough to beat the third man fielder",Bumrah to Uthappa,FOUR
1849030,KKR 1st Inns,3.3,"Malinga to Chris Lynn, FOUR, smacked. Malinga's slower ball provides width for Lynn, frees his arms and throws his bat. Crashes it in the gap at cover. That sped off the bat in a jiffy",Malinga to Chris Lynn,FOUR
1849030,KKR 1st Inns,4.3,"Bumrah to Chris Lynn, no ball, FOUR, slower ball goes all awry for Bumrah. Ends up as a waist-high full toss outside off, Lynn was making room and connects with the slash. Sending it over point and free-hit beckons for Lynn",Bumrah to Chris Lynn,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,10.2,"Narine to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, off-break. Suryakumar too continues staying on the back foot, whipping it with a lot more intent, under short mid-wicket's dive",Narine to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,10.4,"Narine to Rohit, FOUR, so very beautiful. And trust Rohit to come up with them time and again -- this time courtesy just a punch, splitting the two covers",Narine to Rohit,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,14.0,"Narine to Rohit, FOUR, drags it down, and fittingly as KKR's campaign has gone in 2019, Narine too bowls out with a long hop. Rohit goes back in, makes it look a lot worse and pummels it wide of long-on",Narine to Rohit,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,14.2,"Gurney to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, another overcook. This time Suryakumar's good enough to ensure he doesn't need a fielding blunder, does it with an on-drive, through a straighter long-on",Gurney to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,14.5,"Gurney to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, it's into the fun zone. Gurney gives out another short one well down leg and Surya heaves it further. A tickle would've done here, but no, he'll do a carnage",Gurney to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,15.4,"Prasidh to Rohit, FOUR, woah. Rohit > elegance. It's too full anyways and Sharma lays in with a stride getting to it in drilling a lofted drill straight into long-on",Prasidh to Rohit,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,3.1,"A Russell to Rohit, FOUR, delicate! Banged in on a back of a length, good bounce, Rohit gets low, steers it away fine towards the third man fence for four",A Russell to Rohit,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,3.5,"A Russell to de Kock, FOUR, he persists with the short ball ploy, the slower one this time, de Kock shapes up for the pull, delays it beautifully, and clubs it over the in-field to the deep square leg boundary for four. QdK with an epiphany here!",A Russell to de Kock,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,4.5,"Warrier to Rohit, FOUR, short and wide, Rohit flat-bats a pull over a frustrated, crimson Russell, to the long-on fence for four",Warrier to Rohit,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,6.2,"Prasidh to Rohit, FOUR, short and wide, poor bowling, and a gorgeous punch in front of deep point for four",Prasidh to Rohit,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,6.5,"Prasidh to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, short one at the body, Suryakumar Yadav hasn't opened up his stance, finds himself in an awkward position, knows he'll be late on it, and goes for a blind hook - gets bat on it and deflects it away towards fine leg for four",Prasidh to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,7.2,"Narine to Rohit, FOUR, fired down leg, Rohit steps across, laps it away with a fine sweep towards fine leg for four",Narine to Rohit,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,8.5,"Prasidh to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, fuller length delivery outside off, whipped away, dragging it from outside the off-stump with a Laxman-esque flourish for four",Prasidh to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
1849030,MI 1st Inns,9.4,"A Russell to Rohit, FOUR, short, not fast enough - @138.9km/h but a lot of pace lost on this dry wicket. Pulled away off the frontfoot for four through cow corner",A Russell to Rohit,FOUR
5386462,CSK 1st Inns,1.2,"Krunal Pandya to du Plessis, FOUR, just over a leaping Bumrah! Fortune for du Plessis who went hard on seeing the width but was never in control. Ended up slicing it towards short third man and Bumrah despite a great leap could barely get his fingertips on it. Phew!",Krunal Pandya to du Plessis,FOUR
5386462,CSK 1st Inns,10.3,"Malinga to Rayudu, FOUR, nicely done by Rayudu, he pre-empted that Malinga was going to bowl full, bent down low, uses the pace on the ball and flicks it fine, no chance for the fielder at long leg",Malinga to Rayudu,FOUR
5386462,CSK 1st Inns,14.3,"Hardik Pandya to Rayudu, FOUR, nicely played by Rayudu - he's taking the lead here, mid-off was inside the ring and Rayudu chanced his arm - length ball outside off, he didn't time it all that well, sliced it high and cleared the fielder in the ring, one bounce and over the ropes",Hardik Pandya to Rayudu,FOUR
5386462,CSK 1st Inns,17.1,"Bumrah to Rayudu, FOUR, mind-reader Rayudu. Expected the slower delivery from Bumrah, so walks across his stumps and gets into a great position to smack the pull over square leg. Picked his spot and executed it to perfection",Bumrah to Rayudu,FOUR
5386462,CSK 1st Inns,3.1,"Jayant Yadav to Raina, FOUR, this time Raina gets the boundary! On the pads and he swings merrily over backward square leg. Lovely bat swing and it races away to the fence",Jayant Yadav to Raina,FOUR
5386462,CSK 1st Inns,4.2,"Bumrah to Watson, FOUR, some respite for CSK as they get a much-needed boundary. Was a bit too straight from Bumrah and Watson helped it wide of short fine leg with a neat glance",Bumrah to Watson,FOUR
5386462,CSK 1st Inns,5.0,"Bumrah to Watson, FOUR, crunched away! Fractionally short from Bumrah and it's the trademark pull from Watson. Rocks back quickly and dispatches it over mid-wicket. Clean hit",Bumrah to Watson,FOUR
5386462,CSK 1st Inns,5.1,"Krunal Pandya to Vijay, FOUR, streaky runs but they all count! Flattish and turning away from around off, Vijay was squared up all ends up on the flick. Thick edge and it beat backward point, all the way to the fence",Krunal Pandya to Vijay,FOUR
5386462,CSK 1st Inns,5.3,"Krunal Pandya to Vijay, FOUR, this is superb batting from Vijay, attacking spin with positive strokeplay. Shuffles a bit early across the stumps and slog sweeps it cleanly over short fine leg. One bounce to the fence",Krunal Pandya to Vijay,FOUR
5386462,CSK 1st Inns,7.0,"Rahul Chahar to Vijay, FOUR, crisply struck by Vijay, got forward to this half volley and creamed the drive through extra cover. Pollard in the deep made an attempt but couldn't quite succeed",Rahul Chahar to Vijay,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,0.1,"Chahar to Rohit, FOUR, glorious way to kick-start your innings. Outswinger from Chahar, too short and swinging away outside off. Rohit stands tall, hands following and creams it stylishly through extra cover. MI's captain is off and running",Chahar to Rohit,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,1.0,"Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, Suryakumar flashes and flashes hard, nearly picked out the fielder at short third man but it's just out of reach of Tahir. It was short and plenty of width for the taking, Suryakumar obliged and ended up outside-edging it. Luckily, gets away as it just about beats Tahir's dive to his left and runs away to the boundary",Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,1.4,"Harbhajan to de Kock, FOUR, oh! This was fraught with danger. The quicker delivery from Harbhajan, gunning at the stumps and de Kock went deep for the cut. Manages to get his bat down in time and scythes it past backward point. That was a close call",Harbhajan to de Kock,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,10.3,"Tahir to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, there's some helicopter in this one, piling on the low full toss and whipping it into cow corner",Tahir to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,10.4,"Tahir to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, more helicopter. A more-standing one here, staying up on the back foot and the power imparted on it is enough to whack it once again wide of long-on",Tahir to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,13.0,"Jadeja to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, lovely batting from Suryakumar Yadav. Jadeja gets slightly short, and he pounces on it. Right back in the crease, waits for the ball and dabs it past slip. Jadeja livid with himself, swings his hand wildly in frustration",Jadeja to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,13.1,"Tahir to Ishan Kishan, 4 wides, that's just bonus runs. Down the leg-side, turning away further and even Dhoni fails to get across in time. Desperate effort from Harbhajan to save the boundary",Tahir to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,13.2,"Tahir to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, should I, shouldn't I.. while Harbhajan deliberates on the dive, the ball goes through. Another deft touch from Suryakumar, dabbing this flat leg-break fine of backward point",Tahir to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,14.1,"Jadeja to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, the outside edge flies between keeper and slip. Absolutely flew off the bat. Length ball ripping away from off, draws Yadav forward in defence and the turn is prodigious. Watson is slow to react, and when he does, it doesn't stick in the left hand",Jadeja to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,15.4,"Tahir to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, drifting down leg, Hardik Pandya picks the line up quickly, gets down low and paddles it on its way",Tahir to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,18.2,"Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, walks across, gets underneath this back of a length delivery and scoops it fine. He's been different class tonight",Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,2.4,"Chahar to de Kock, FOUR, wonderful adjustment from de Kock. It was length outside off, de Kock sits low, rolls his wrists and laps it to the fine leg fence. Knew the fielder was squarer, so placed it beautifully",Chahar to de Kock,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,4.2,"Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, loses radar. Yea, the overestimation of his swing - starting on the middle-stump line and expecting it to go across. But alas, it goes straight on, and Suryakumar makes it worse with his shuffle, tickling it off his thighs fine",Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,4.3,"Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, dropped. Yadav tries a cross-batted whack, but the ball sticks in, just doesn't come on. And Vijay - the mid-on guy - is a touch late in reacting, but does decently towards the end to stretch out, only for the ball to burst through the palms",Chahar to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,5.4,"Harbhajan to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, ah, ugly. Really, really bad-looking. Kishan - desperate to breach this pressure he's put on himself - runs down the pitch, hoicks big, hoping to go somewhere over cow corner, but only ends up with a thick leading edge, just past Watson leaping up at slip and managing to trickle under Bravo's diving attempts in the deep",Harbhajan to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
5386462,MI 1st Inns,9.2,"Dwayne Bravo to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, 131.6kph, continues dishing out full pace and Yadav obliges with the elegant-est of cover drives, on the up,through both the dives of extra cover and mid-off",Dwayne Bravo to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan, FOUR, Dhawan is off and running. That is a super shot. Not much wrong with the delivery. Good length just outside off, Dhawan drives with minimal footwork and pierces the gap wide of cover. The timing was exquisite",Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan, FOUR, overcorrects his line and is made to pay. On a length on leg-stump, Dhawan leans into the flick and strikes it square past the umpire, no chance for fine leg to get across and stop that",Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,13.2,"Basil Thampi to Munro, FOUR, jumps out, looks to slam it away into the on-side and gets a fine inside edge for the ball to whizz past the keeper to his right for a four. Streaky but much needed",Basil Thampi to Munro,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,17.1,"Basil Thampi to Pant, FOUR, fuller and slower, thumped down the ground! That was blasted past the bowler. Basil Thampi had no chance. Have SRH made a mistake by giving it to Thampi?",Basil Thampi to Pant,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,17.3,"Basil Thampi to Pant, FOUR, DC and Pant are bossing this chase now! KW has played his cards wrong tonight. Length ball on the pads and has been whipped away past the short fine leg fielder for a four",Basil Thampi to Pant,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,19.5,"Khaleel Ahmed to K Paul, FOUR, Paul has done it! DC have pulled it off. They are through to qualifier 2. Short ball, Paul got hold of it and pulled it away, the ball evaded Shankar in the deep. A cliff-hanger and DC have held their nerves despite huffing and puffing a lot towards the end",Khaleel Ahmed to K Paul,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,2.2,"Khaleel Ahmed to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, normal pace delivery and Khaleel is put away over mid-on. Back of a length and Shaw gets into a good position and pumps it over the fielder inside the ring",Khaleel Ahmed to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,2.3,"Khaleel Ahmed to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, this is even better. Khaleel has to correct his length quickly, short of length and Shaw had the pace to work with, rocks back and nails the pull in front of square, one bounce and over the ropes",Khaleel Ahmed to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,2.5,"Khaleel Ahmed to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, woah! That is smoked to the fence. Good length ball outside off, Shaw brings that high backlift into play and crunches the square drive past cover-point, no one moved in the off-side ring",Khaleel Ahmed to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,4.0,"Nabi to Dhawan, FOUR, that is a good shot. Nabi is disappointed but there was not much he could do. Drifting in from round the wicket, Dhawan fetches the reverse sweep from leg-stump and places it past the backward point fielder",Nabi to Dhawan,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,4.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, Prithvi Shaw is looking in sublime touch. Just leans forward, presents full face of the bat and pings the push drive off the middle past the diving fielder at extra cover",Bhuvneshwar to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,4.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, this is sheer stand-and-deliver stuff! Gets a length ball outside off with a hint of extra bounce, Prithvi Shaw doesn't care one bit and thumps it over the mid-off fielder in a jiffy",Bhuvneshwar to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,5.5,"Rashid Khan to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, picks the legbreak and pumps the drive over cover, excellent batting this from Prithvi Shaw. Making great use of the fielding restrictions and looking to pierce gaps as often",Rashid Khan to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
7680387,DC 1st Inns,8.4,"Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, don't want to jinx it but Shreyas Iyer is one of the best batters of spin bowling. Sees a hint of width on this legbreak and jumps on it in a flash, opens the bat face and nails the cut behind point",Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,1.0,"Boult to Saha, FOUR, beautifully struck! Hint of width from Boult and Saha lays into the back foot punch, square through the off-side. Finds the gap at point and it scooted away to the fence. Elegant shot!",Boult to Saha,FOUR
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,11.3,"Axar to Manish Pandey, FOUR, cracking shot, fraction too short and wide of off, Manish makes room, waits on it and then slices the cut past the reach of Munro at backward point - much needed boundary for the Sunrisers",Axar to Manish Pandey,FOUR
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,14.3,"Rutherford to Williamson, FOUR, cracking shot, a half-tracker from Rutherford, short and wide of off, Williamson makes room and clatters it wide of cover - the man in the deep is very square and has no chance",Rutherford to Williamson,FOUR
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,15.4,"Ishant to Williamson, FOUR, poor cricket from Boult - he was never going to get to the ball, not with the angle he was running into - dived forward and then let the ball go past him, concedes a boundary. The slower ball from Ishant, rolled away fingers across the seam, Williamson picked it and then swung it behind square on the on-side for a boundary",Ishant to Williamson,FOUR
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,16.0,"Ishant to Nabi, FOUR, beautifully played, nice way to get your innings underway, back of a length and well wide of off, Nabi waited on it, used Ishant's pace and then chopped it late - behind square on the off-side and into the ropes",Ishant to Nabi,FOUR
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,16.2,"Axar to Nabi, FOUR, that's two delicate shots from Nabi for two boundaries. He waits for the ball to turn away, opens the bat face and runs it past short third man. The pace of Axar takes care of the rest",Axar to Nabi,FOUR
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,17.2,"K Paul to Nabi, FOUR, smashed! Stand and deliver from Nabi. He literally stood there and admired the shot. Similar delivery to the previous one, but this time Nabi does not miss, he hammers it straight back over Paul and the ball almost went the distance",K Paul to Nabi,FOUR
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,17.5,"K Paul to Shankar, FOUR, very well played. Another short delivery and almost near the badge, Shankar is quickly into position and pulls it with a nice wrist roll backward of square leg. No chance for Dhawan in the deep",K Paul to Shankar,FOUR
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,18.1,"Boult to Shankar, FOUR, lovely shot! Shankar has used the angle of Boult to superb effect. Slanted across the right hander outside off, Shankar shuffles across and lofts it handsomely over extra cover, one bounce and over the ropes",Boult to Shankar,FOUR
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,3.4,"Ishant to Guptill, FOUR, poor ball and Guptill punishes it! Sprayed on the pads, fuller as well and he just had to pick his spot. Watches it onto the bat and glances it very fine, beating short fine leg with ease",Ishant to Guptill,FOUR
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,5.1,"Ishant to Manish Pandey, FOUR, misfield allows a boundary! Ishant can't even complain because it's his skipper who is the culprit at mid-off. Pandey thumped the drive really well and Iyer wanted to attack the ball to have a shy at the bowler's end. Eventually missed it completely",Ishant to Manish Pandey,FOUR
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,5.5,"Ishant to Manish Pandey, FOUR, top edge but it's nearly gone all the way! Cons of having pace! Good fiery bumper from Ishant and Pandey is clearly late on the pull. But he knew that fine leg was up and hence, there wasn't much risk on the stroke. Eventually fetches a boundary",Ishant to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,11.2,"K Paul to Watson, FOUR, short slower ball and Watson has smashed that over mid-wicket, Keemo Paul has been off colour unfortunately for DC on the big day",K Paul to Watson,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,15.4,"Axar to Rayudu, FOUR, round the wicket, angles it in, Rayudu was already setting up for this - dances down the track and lofts it inside out towards the deep extra cover fence for four",Axar to Rayudu,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,16.3,"Boult to Dhoni, FOUR, the crowd go berserk! A poor delivery on the torso, on the leg-side, Dhoni just gives it some topspin and swivels on it to deflect it away to fine leg for four",Boult to Dhoni,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,17.2,"K Paul to Rayudu, FOUR, erring in line, angling into the pads once again, tickled away fine towards the long leg fence for four",K Paul to Rayudu,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,17.5,"K Paul to Rayudu, FOUR, short and wide outside off, Rayudu carves it away with a massive flourish between short third man and backward point for four",K Paul to Rayudu,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,19.0,"Ishant to Dwayne Bravo, FOUR leg-byes, CSK are through to their 8th final in 10 editions they have played! A short one that's angling down leg, Dwayne Bravo whips it away off the backfoot (off the pads in fact) past a desperately-diving Pant towards the fine leg fence for four - and there are hugs in the changing room already. CSK are through to another final - surprise, surprise!",Ishant to Dwayne Bravo,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,2.3,"Boult to du Plessis, FOUR, too short perhaps and Faf powers it through mid-wicket with a crisp pull off the bottom hand, picked the length early and got onto his back foot in a hurry",Boult to du Plessis,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,4.2,"Axar to du Plessis, FOUR, stands outside leg stump and thumps this in the gap between backward point and cover. Made room early and cuts the quicker delivery in the gap on the off-side",Axar to du Plessis,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,5.1,"Ishant to du Plessis, FOUR, pulled away and Faf is looking to mae the most of the final over of the powerplay, back of a length delivery on the stumps, du Plessis waits and pulls behind square, the man in the deep is very square and it goes to his right",Ishant to du Plessis,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,5.2,"Ishant to du Plessis, FOUR, guided away uppishly and just wide of Munro at short third man, short of length again from Ishant, this time it's slightly outside off stump, Faf guides and gets four more",Ishant to du Plessis,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,5.3,"Ishant to du Plessis, FOUR, hat-trick of boundaries, short delivery on the stumps, du Plessis rocks back and pulls over mid-wicket, easy boundary, CSK well ahead now",Ishant to du Plessis,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,7.0,"Mishra to du Plessis, FOUR, oh excellent sweep shot, got low early with no one at deep square leg and absolutely smashed this shot from the middle of the bat to find the fence",Mishra to du Plessis,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,7.4,"K Paul to Watson, FOUR, low full toss on the leg stump, easily ball, Watson glances it fine and beats short fine leg",K Paul to Watson,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,8.0,"K Paul to du Plessis, FOUR, this is very unlucky for the bowler. He's actually beaten Faf with a back of a length delivery, inside edge onto pad, goes past Pant, Munro gives chase from short third, dives and pulls it back, probably he was in touch with the rope for a moment and it's been signalled four",K Paul to du Plessis,FOUR
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,8.1,"Mishra to Watson, FOUR, nicely paddled away, no fine leg, so he was aware of the field and was in position early to help it on its way",Mishra to Watson,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,1.0,"Chahar to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, smashed! This is the length that Shaw enjoys a lot. Shorter from Chahar and it's been dispatched with a nonchalant pull through square leg",Chahar to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,1.3,"SN Thakur to Dhawan, FOUR, beautifully timed! Thakur searches for swing and in the process, overcooks this outside off. Stroked sweetly down the ground and beats the diving mid-off fielder with ease",SN Thakur to Dhawan,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,1.4,"SN Thakur to Dhawan, FOUR, this is a stunning shot! Wow! Another fuller one and this time, Dhawan was merely pushing it straight back past the bowler. Such amazing timing and the ball just rocketed away. Signs that this is a much better surface than the eliminator",SN Thakur to Dhawan,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,1.5,"SN Thakur to Dhawan, FOUR, pressure telling on Thakur and Dhawan is ruthless. Harmless short ball that's pulled away through square leg. 'Gabbar' seizing the momentum straightaway",SN Thakur to Dhawan,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,10.3,"Dwayne Bravo to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, cracking shot! Tad fuller around off, Iyer brings his bat down in a sweet flow and crunches his drive past the fielder at cover. There was a fielder in the deep to hunt it down but the timing was just about right",Dwayne Bravo to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,13.2,"Tahir to Rutherford, leg byes, FOUR, CSK take a review against Rutherford! Imran Tahir looked excited but the impact looks just outside off, or probably umpire's call. Nope, wait. The impact was in line but the ball was bouncing over the stumps by some distance. Rutherford was trying to play a drive but got beaten for spin. The ball clips his pads and races away to the fence thereafter. The onfield call stays",Tahir to Rutherford,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,16.3,"Tahir to Pant, FOUR, controlled aggression from Rishabh Pant! Sits on one knee, picks the legbreak and sweeps it in the gap between deep square and deep mid-wicket",Tahir to Pant,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,19.0,"Chahar to Mishra, FOUR, gets across and picks Chahar off his pads over fine leg, clean swing of the bat and timed it to perfection",Chahar to Mishra,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,19.5,"Jadeja to Ishant, FOUR, no spin on this, Ishant uses his long levers and muscles it to the left of long-on, Faf tried his best to get behind the ball but Ishant, perhaps, timed it too well",Jadeja to Ishant,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,2.5,"Chahar to Munro, FOUR, hammered! Clear intent from Munro as he gives the charge and forces this length ball past the bowler. Well wide of mid-on and it speeds away",Chahar to Munro,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,3.3,"Harbhajan to Munro, FOUR, 'hit me' ball from Harbhajan and Munro pummels it through the off-side. Slower, shorter and wider as well, gift for any batsman and it gets the treatment. Slapped through point",Harbhajan to Munro,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,7.4,"Harbhajan to Munro, FOUR, crashed away by Munro! Got a bit of width on this turning off break, the length allowed him to wait and he slapped it through cover-point. Sweeper is behind square on the off-side and had no chance",Harbhajan to Munro,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,7.5,"Harbhajan to Munro, FOUR, over the infield! Fuller this time and Munro wisely goes over cover. With the spin and the loft is clean. This stroke should give him confidence",Harbhajan to Munro,FOUR
9969874,DC 1st Inns,9.4,"Tahir to Pant, FOUR, there's never a dull moment when Pant is out there. Premeditates yet again and scoops the floated delivery towards fine leg. The fielder was no where close to cut this down, neither inside the circle nor outside it",Tahir to Pant,FOUR
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,0.3,"McClenaghan to du Plessis, FOUR, that's overpitched and it's gone to the fence in a flash. Du Plessis leans across, right on top of it, before drilling it through the covers",McClenaghan to du Plessis,FOUR
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,1.4,"Krunal Pandya to Watson, FOUR, way too full from Krunal, a half-volley really which Watson pulverizes through the covers. That's too easy, something MI can ill afford",Krunal Pandya to Watson,FOUR
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,12.0,"Rahul Chahar to Watson, FOUR, oh Bumrah! Rahul Chahar will be livid with him. Bowled so well and he's let this go right through him for four. Would have been a single maximum. But Chahar's got to blame himself in the first place for bowling a freebie down the leg-side, Watto sweeps and gets it through short fine leg",Rahul Chahar to Watson,FOUR
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,15.3,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR, 138.8kph. Keeps dishing out pace, keeps it wide outside off and Watson's edge will do just as well. There may have been a short third man, but the slice is such that it's very fine",Malinga to Watson,FOUR
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,15.4,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR, oh, better. Malinga - with more pace - and with more in the slot. Wide, outside off, Watson moves away, sits down on a knee and carves it away into third man, almost all the way too",Malinga to Watson,FOUR
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,15.5,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR, it's on loop. 15.3, 15.4 and 15.5, each one predictable perfectly -- all pace dealt out outside off, lots of width too and this time Watson picks out deep extra cover with that usual muscular slash",Malinga to Watson,FOUR
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,19.0,"Bumrah to Jadeja, byes, FOUR, oh Quinton .. you may have heard of cups dropped, this is probably the cup misfielded. It was quick, really quick, and going well over the cut, and de Kock, in his quest to throw it quicker and stop the bye, ends up not collecting at all",Bumrah to Jadeja,FOUR
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,3.2,"Krunal Pandya to du Plessis, FOUR, steps outside the leg stump again, Krunal follows him again but he errs with his length this time. It's too full. Du Plessis lofts it over mid-on",Krunal Pandya to du Plessis,FOUR
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,3.4,"Krunal Pandya to du Plessis, FOUR, completely unsettling the left-armer here. Backing away, making him change the lines. Krunal doesn't follow him this time, so instead, he gets cut through backward point",Krunal Pandya to du Plessis,FOUR
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,5.2,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR, wasn't in control, Watson. Overpitched outside off, he went so hard on the drive that the poise was lost and his bat-face opened up - slicing it uppishly past backward point",Malinga to Watson,FOUR
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,5.5,"Malinga to Watson, FOUR, finds the gap between backward point and short third man. These are mostly off-cutters from Malinga, which explains why third man is up. But this one has enough width on it, so Watson can manufacture the pace with his hands as he cuts",Malinga to Watson,FOUR
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,8.2,"McClenaghan to Watson, FOUR, wowww! What an off-drive, the strike-rate is up and running again. Very brave from Ro to have mid-off in at this stage, but Watto made full use of this juicy full ball and powered it to the fence",McClenaghan to Watson,FOUR
8026316,MI 1st Inns,10.3,"Harbhajan to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, terrific catch from RJ - well, nearly, only he could have got to the ball, ran in a long way from deep mid-wicket, dived across to his left, went one-handed and got to the ball, but it kept going away and bounced past his outstretched hands. Nicely played by Suryakumar, knew that mid-wicket was wide and clipped it high and wide of that fielder - any other fielder and it was an easy boundary",Harbhajan to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
8026316,MI 1st Inns,11.0,"Harbhajan to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, that has been muscled - Kishan making his intentions clear - fetched a well flighted delivery from outside off and heaved it wide of mid-wicket - the fielder at long-on can't get across in time",Harbhajan to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
8026316,MI 1st Inns,15.4,"Jadeja to Pollard, FOUR, Chahar goes for the catch at deep cover and the ball bounces just in front of him to go away to the fence. That was sliced away powerfully and Chahar came charging in only to find the ball dropping right in front of him",Jadeja to Pollard,FOUR
8026316,MI 1st Inns,18.1,"Chahar to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, short ball, Hardik Pandya stays back and pulls it down to deep mid for a four. Was in the gap between deep mid and long-on. MI on a roll post the drop!",Chahar to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
8026316,MI 1st Inns,19.5,"Dwayne Bravo to Pollard, FOUR, power, brute power! Full, outside off and slammed between deep cover and deep long-off for a four. Whatta shot!!! Pollard absolutely drilled that. Dwayne Bravo missed the wide yorker not by much",Dwayne Bravo to Pollard,FOUR
8026316,MI 1st Inns,20.0,"Dwayne Bravo to Pollard, FOUR, and Pollard signs off with a four! An angry Pollard walks off. That 'could have been wide ball' playing on his mind. Was fuller, missed the mark though, and Pollard butchered it between deep cover and long-off. Sped into the fence in a jiffy",Dwayne Bravo to Pollard,FOUR
8026316,MI 1st Inns,4.0,"Harbhajan to Rohit, FOUR, errs off the final ball - a flat one on the pads, Rohit is quick to pounce on it, shapes up to sweep, and nails it to the backward square leg fence for four",Harbhajan to Rohit,FOUR
8026316,MI 1st Inns,9.1,"Dwayne Bravo to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, clubbed, nice way to start after the break, length delivery outside off, Kishan leant forward and lifted it high and over mid-on, almost went all the way, bounced just in front of the ropes",Dwayne Bravo to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
8026316,MI 1st Inns,9.5,"Dwayne Bravo to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, nicely played, the loopy slower ball from Bravo, kept dipping onto the left-hander - Kishan was setting himself up for the pull, bends down low with the ball and then sweeps it behind square on the on-side - beat the man in the ring and raced away to the ropes",Dwayne Bravo to Ishan Kishan,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,0.5,"Boult to Watson, FOUR, fetch that! On a full length outside off, shaping away to an extent and Watson throws the kitchen sink at it. Smacks it over extra cover as he's off the mark with a boundary",Boult to Watson,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,11.5,"Bumrah to Rayudu, FOUR, absolute smash back, tennis forehand. A walk, clearing the front leg and a swat downtown, with Bumrah getting a fingertip as he tries pulling his hand out of the way. Oh and also, a fifty -- and revenge for the 2019 WC is well and truly complete",Bumrah to Rayudu,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,14.3,"Bumrah to du Plessis, FOUR, 144.5kph. Slight width, wth Faf backing away to snatch a lot more to slap this with lots of bottom-hand, past Rohit's dive at short cover",Bumrah to du Plessis,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,16.1,"Pattinson to Jadeja, FOUR, filthy loose a line. Full, leg-lined and Jadeja just waits for it to get close before whipping it really fine",Pattinson to Jadeja,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,16.5,"Pattinson to Jadeja, FOUR, nothing dicey here. Pattinson feeds him a high full toss outside off and Jadeja neatly opens his bat face to carve it backward of point",Pattinson to Jadeja,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,17.5,"Krunal Pandya to Sam Curran, FOUR, there's nobody in the deep on the off-side, but Pandya for some reason still wants to bowl a half-tracker with lots of width. Curran won't complain, slicing it over cover, which is all he had to do",Krunal Pandya to Sam Curran,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,18.3,"Bumrah to du Plessis, FOUR, sealed some more. Another poor delivery, slow, short, wide. Faf has all the time he needs, staying up tall and slicing over cover in the ring with nobody behind",Bumrah to du Plessis,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,19.1,"Boult to du Plessis, FOUR, sliced over point. Boult goes round the wicket and dishes out a floaty lazy non-warmed-up delivery that's full, wide and worthy of a dispatch. Yep, over backward",Boult to du Plessis,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,19.2,"Boult to du Plessis, FOUR, no fuss. Boult overcompensates with one that's short, into the body and gets swiped into deep mid-wicket. Again, no fuss, not even a celebration. Typical dad stuff, you're never happy, and that's exactly what this CSK are",Boult to du Plessis,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,3.0,"Boult to du Plessis, FOUR, that shall release some nerves in the CSK camp. Pitched on a full length outside off, du Plessis reaches out for it by leaning ahead and creams it through extra cover as the ball races away in no time",Boult to du Plessis,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,3.1,"Pattinson to Rayudu, FOUR, swinging like the pendulum of a clock already, this innings. Back of a length delivery outside off, width on offer and Rayudu has thumped it through cover-point with authority. No need to run for those",Pattinson to Rayudu,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,4.1,"Boult to Rayudu, FOUR, quality shot! Typical Rayudu as he leans forward, converts the length into a slight full one and creams it through the gap on the off side. Looks batting look so effortless",Boult to Rayudu,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,6.0,"Bumrah to Rayudu, no ball, FOUR, slashed away! Not that short, neither too full. Sets up for Rayudu who makes use of the slight width and flashes it over point. No ball. Free hit coming!",Bumrah to Rayudu,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,7.5,"Rahul Chahar to du Plessis, FOUR, fantastic Faf! All about timing, this shot. Shimmies down the track and although the ball sticks into the surface - the class of du Plessis takes over. Goes inside out with a checked lofted drive and manages to beat Surya at long-off",Rahul Chahar to du Plessis,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,9.3,"Rahul Chahar to Rayudu, FOUR, not a great effort by Bumrah at short fine leg, he should have stopped this. Was down the leg side as Rayudu swept it past the man at short fine leg",Rahul Chahar to Rayudu,FOUR
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,9.4,"Rahul Chahar to Rayudu, FOUR, back-to-back sloppy efforts. A tossed up delivery outside off and Rayudu chips it to deep cover where Boult makes a mess of it. Was charging in to avoid the batsmen from taking the second, and ends up gifting them a boundary. Rohit Sharma wouldn't be a happy skipper with those two boundaries..",Rahul Chahar to Rayudu,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,0.1,"Chahar to Rohit, FOUR, there is swing alright, but it's an absolute loosener. Sitting up from a back of a length outside off, gets whacked through covers. Rohit is underway in IPL 2020. Stood there in the crease and nonchalantly drove it on the back foot",Chahar to Rohit,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,0.4,"Chahar to de Kock, FOUR, been a rusty start from Chahar, who now doles out a half-volley on the pads of de Kock. Gleefully flicked through midwicket, the timing is superb",Chahar to de Kock,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,1.4,"Sam Curran to Rohit, FOUR, plenty of width outside off, the hard part for Rohit is to stretch out to meet it. So it's commendable that his timing is still so great as he smears it through backward point",Sam Curran to Rohit,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,12.3,"Ngidi to Saurabh Tiwary, FOUR, shortish and Tiwary has pulled. This is a seriously good cameo from Tiwary. Came in at the fall of two big wickets, but kept the shots coming. This one's pulled over mid-wicket",Ngidi to Saurabh Tiwary,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,12.4,"Ngidi to Saurabh Tiwary, FOUR, oh Lungi! He's the old fit self that he is. The rhythm isn't there, the strides aren't intense. Full delivery, Tiwary charges and slaps wide of mid-off. Can't be bowling full with mid-off in",Ngidi to Saurabh Tiwary,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,17.2,"Sam Curran to Pattinson, FOUR, Pattinson powers this down the ground, no long-off so it runs off to the boundary. Sam Curran overpitched this one and got punished",Sam Curran to Pattinson,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,17.4,"Sam Curran to Pollard, FOUR, this is really poor bowling! Low full toss down leg, Pollard flicks, fine leg in, it's a sin to bowl there. Pollard calmly glances knowing the field and collects four",Sam Curran to Pollard,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,18.3,"Ngidi to Pattinson, FOUR, oh Chahar! Dhoni won't be happy with that effort. Short of a length delivery on the stumps, Pattinson pullls through mid-wicket, what should have been maximum two is now four because Chahar didn't bend enough. The eternal fast bowler's problem! I know!",Ngidi to Pattinson,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,2.5,"Chahar to de Kock, FOUR, slower ball at 119kph, sits up for de Kock from the middle of the pitch as he heaves through midwicket. Chahar's not been great here at the start",Chahar to de Kock,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,3.2,"Ngidi to de Kock, FOUR, full in the slot for de Kock who pumps it over mid-off. Really taking the bowling on, although the bowling is really ordinary at this stage",Ngidi to de Kock,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,3.4,"Ngidi to de Kock, FOUR, four more for de Kock, although this has come off a perfectly decent delivery. Back of a length at the top of off, and it's been met with disdain from de Kock who clears his front leg and slogs it over mid-on. Almost went all the way",Ngidi to de Kock,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,3.5,"Ngidi to de Kock, FOUR, he's on an absolute roll. Succeeds with the scoop this time, something which he was trying earlier in the over. Walks across, gets a length ball and ramps it over short fine",Ngidi to de Kock,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,6.2,"Jadeja to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, beautiful from Suryakumar as he clears the front leg and lifts this delivery over extra cover. Great timing on it to beat long-off",Jadeja to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,7.5,"Sam Curran to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, back of a length, cutting away across off. There should've been no room for Suryakumar here, but he's manufactured it for himself by stepping away. But even from his modified position, the width isn't quite there to free the arms. Still, he's able to scythe this through baclward point. Beats third man's diving effort",Sam Curran to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
5554057,MI 1st Inns,8.4,"Jadeja to Saurabh Tiwary, FOUR, short enough and wide enough, slapped away for four through backward point. MI regaining momentum through these two again",Jadeja to Saurabh Tiwary,FOUR
5646986,DC 1st Inns,0.4,"Cottrell to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, edged and four, full and angling across the right-hander, Shaw saw the width and went hard on the drive, gets a thick edge that flies through the vacant slip region - a desperate dive from Sarfaraz near the third man rope, but he can only palm it to the ropes",Cottrell to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
5646986,DC 1st Inns,11.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, FOUR, 89.3kph, the googly spinning away across the left-hander outside off. Pant swings hard, balance out of sync and elicits a thick outside edge which flies through the vacant slip region. Bishnoi has his hands on his head.. lucky Pant",Ravi Bishnoi to Pant,FOUR
5646986,DC 1st Inns,13.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to Pant, FOUR, Pant gets into the act now. Bishnoi pitches it teasingly just outside off, Pant bends low and goes for a cross-batted down-town swing. Picks the gap at long-on and it's a boundary..",Ravi Bishnoi to Pant,FOUR
5646986,DC 1st Inns,17.2,"Jordan to Stoinis, FOUR, uff! How did Stoinis manage to get some bat on this? A fast low full toss, Stoinis gives everything at it and it brushes the inside edge, beats the man at short fine leg. Had he missed it, he would've caught plumb in front. KXIP knew how close it was.. sigh!",Jordan to Stoinis,FOUR
5646986,DC 1st Inns,18.1,"Cottrell to Stoinis, FOUR, bullied past mid-off. Stoinis is the designated finisher for DC and he's playing a gem here. Takes toll of this overpitched delivery outside off and places it perfectly in the gap",Cottrell to Stoinis,FOUR
5646986,DC 1st Inns,18.2,"Cottrell to Stoinis, FOUR, back-to-back fours for Stoinis. This is a well-calculated shot. Just got inside the line of this slower ball and helped it over short fine leg's head disdainfully. Fantastic start to the 19th over for Delhi",Cottrell to Stoinis,FOUR
5646986,DC 1st Inns,18.3,"Cottrell to Stoinis, FOUR, third boundary of the over and KL Rahul immediately walks up to have a chat with the bowler. A juicy low full toss outside off, Stoinis with fast hands hammers it powerfully square on the off-side and threads the gap",Cottrell to Stoinis,FOUR
5646986,DC 1st Inns,19.2,"Jordan to Stoinis, FOUR, edged and four. DC and Stoinis won't mind how the runs come at this stage. Shortish outside off, Stoinis goes for the cut with horizontal bat and gets an outside edge which travels in a jiffy to the third man fence",Jordan to Stoinis,FOUR
5646986,DC 1st Inns,19.3,"Jordan to Stoinis, FOUR, four more to Stoinis! Jordan trusts his instincts and tries the yorker, misses it by a few inches and Stoinis, in this form, won't miss out. Whips it off his pads behind square and collects another boundary",Jordan to Stoinis,FOUR
5646986,DC 1st Inns,19.4,"Jordan to Stoinis, FOUR, hat-trick of fours here. Raining boundaries. Jordan shifts his line outside off, Stoinis with a bent knee reaches out and drills it over extra cover",Jordan to Stoinis,FOUR

5646986,KXIP 1st Inns,18.4,"Rabada to Agarwal, FOUR, it's all happening for the Kings XI Punjab, a miscue, a steepling top-edge and Iyer off all people has made a mess of it. Could this be the pivotal moment of the game? Banged in short and Mayank got into a poor position on the pull, was cramped for room and all he managed was a thick leading edge over mid-wicket, went high and down towards the rope. Iyer came running across from the deep, did all the hard yards, got both hands and let it burst through - to add insult to injury, it rolled over the ropes",Rabada to Agarwal,FOUR

But Padikkal deserves this bit of luck. Fifty on debut. What a start. Can't imagine Kohli's emotions right now. He would be really excited. Flighted delivery on the stumps, the slog-sweep behind square, Rashid attacked the bat as it was hit flat, but he realised it was going over, so put the brakes and tried to go back but slipped and the outstretched arm wasn't long enough.

4286363,SRH 1st Inns,16.0,"Chahal to Abhishek Sharma, FOUR, nice shot from Abhishek Sharma! Targets straight boundary and hits it with a neat lofty drive down the ground, picked the full delivery around off and lifted it with ease. That is a really crucial boundary. Kohli talking to Chahal about that ball, looks like he's telling Chahal that he should've been defensive. Because these are two young players at the crease, may find it difficult against Steyn. Four vital runs given away. Credit to Sharma for smoking it",Chahal to Abhishek Sharma,FOUR

4286363,SRH 1st Inns,4.2,"U Yadav to Manish Pandey, FOUR, oh dear! The confidence is just not there. And with each delivery it gets worse. Low full toss on leg, Pandey helps himself to another boundary as he flicks past short fine",U Yadav to Manish Pandey,FOUR
4286363,SRH 1st Inns,5.4,"Navdeep Saini to Bairstow, FOUR, that's a Bairstow special. The short-arm pull.. the way he just picks length quickly and whips it so effortlessly with superb timing.

3533313,RR 1st Inns,19.3,"Ngidi to Jofra Archer, no ball, SIX, four sixes on the trot - this is a stunning cameo from Archer - length ball at the stumps, Archer backs away and lifts it high and over long-off.. and the third umpire decides that the front-foot is just over, called as a no-ball",Ngidi to Jofra Archer,FOUR
3533313,RR 1st Inns,2.1,"Chahar to Jaiswal, FOUR, first boundary for Jaiswal. Short of length delivery and he did not have much space to free his arms, but manages to pull it over mid-wicket and the fast outfield does the rest",Chahar to Jaiswal,FOUR
3533313,RR 1st Inns,2.5,"Chahar to Smith, FOUR, another short ball and this time Smith puts it away. No height or venom on this, Smith is quickly into position and nails the pull over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and it races away",Chahar to Smith,FOUR
3533313,RR 1st Inns,4.3,"Sam Curran to Samson, FOUR, not sure he intended it to go that fine. Short of length with a bit of extra bounce, Samson steers it and the outside edge runs away fine - bisecting Dhoni and short third man",Sam Curran to Samson,FOUR
3533313,RR 1st Inns,5.5,"Chahar to Smith, FOUR, poor bowling from Chahar. He has been all over the shop. Straying down leg and that is not where you bowl to Smith, easy pickings for the Royals skipper as he glances it fine past the fielder at 45",Chahar to Smith,FOUR

4162325,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Boult to Shubman Gill, FOUR, that's a pie for Gill. Short, width and studded with pace on it outside off. Gill throws his bat and crunches it through the packed off-side field",Boult to Shubman Gill,FOUR
4162325,KKR 1st Inns,3.0,"Boult to Karthik, FOUR, nice, confident beginning for DK. Of course, Boult was generous there; hurling it too full and thereby overpitching it just outside off, Karthik didn't do anything fancy. Just leant forward, kept his head steady and drove it beautifully through extra cover",Boult to Karthik,FOUR
4162325,KKR 1st Inns,4.2,"Pattinson to Karthik, FOUR, glorious shot from Karthik. He's come out with a positive intent. Sees the width, transfers his body weight across and slaps it wonderfully past cover. That just rocketed away to the fence in no time",Pattinson to Karthik,FOUR

4162325,MI 1st Inns,12.2,"Warrier to Rohit, FOUR, KKR have bowled a lot of short balls to Rohit today and most of them have disappeared. This was outside off and Rohit had the room to free his arms, slaps it over extra cover and the ball bounces just inside the rope",Warrier to Rohit,FOUR
4162325,MI 1st Inns,14.1,"Cummins to Saurabh Tiwary, FOUR, not a good start. Back of a length angled across the left hander, Tiwary flat-bats without any timing straight past Cummins, with mid-on and mid-off inside the ring the ball races away to the fence",Cummins to Saurabh Tiwary,FOUR
4162325,MI 1st Inns,16.3,"Cummins to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, lovely shot! Slower short of length delivery and Pandya pulls it in front of square, the best thing was he rolled his wrist to keep it in the gap and bisect the two fielders in the deep",Cummins to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
4162325,MI 1st Inns,16.4,"Cummins to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, and again.. Cummins became predictable there. Pandya was waiting for the short of length stuff, he strikes this much better than the last one and it almost goes the distance",Cummins to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
4162325,MI 1st Inns,17.2,"Shivam Mavi to Rohit, FOUR, well KKR bowlers have to go back to the drawing boards after this game and come up with a different plan to Rohit next time.

4162325,MI 1st Inns,19.3,"Shivam Mavi to Pollard, FOUR, misses the yorker and it is a juicy full toss just below waist, Pollard picked his spot and it is deep mid-wicket. Not the best of connections and hence he picks up only a boundary",Shivam Mavi to Pollard,FOUR
4162325,MI 1st Inns,2.1,"Warrier to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, inside edged! Short of a length delivery outside off, seams into the batsman and Suryakumar Yadav gets an inside edge as he flashes hard.

4162325,MI 1st Inns,2.5,"Warrier to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, off the radar again. Width on offer as he bowls a length delivery.

4162325,MI 1st Inns,3.0,"Warrier to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, classic counterattack by Surya. This was a dropped catch at mid-wicket as Narine failed to reverse cup it, parrying it away to the fence. Warrier bowled an overpitched delivery on leg and the right hander flicks it uppishly for the fourth boundary of the over",Warrier to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
4162325,MI 1st Inns,5.1,"Narine to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, whipped away! Floated on middle and leg, Suryakumar Yadav is on his front foot to heave this one towards the deep mid-wicket fence. Played that in the air, but more importantly in the gap",Narine to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
4162325,MI 1st Inns,5.4,"Narine to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, 50-run stand up for the second wicket. Short ball by Narine and Suryakumar Yadav lines up for it.

5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,12.1,"Navdeep Saini to Rahul, leg byes, FOUR, poor delivery to start with. Rahul might not have got any bat on this length delivery down leg, but there is a big deflection off the pad to beat a diving Philippe",Navdeep Saini to Rahul,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,12.5,"Navdeep Saini to Rahul, FOUR, top-edge and it runs away to the fence. Rahul was in no control there. Sharp bouncer around the left shoulder, Rahul was late on the hook and hence the edge, flies right over Philippe. He then practices playing the ramp instead of the hook",Navdeep Saini to Rahul,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,13.0,"Navdeep Saini to Rahul, FOUR, and Saini errs in length. He goes full and Rahul is just too good there, extension of the arms and lofts it over extra cover, the ball has enough to trickle into the fence",Navdeep Saini to Rahul,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,14.3,"Chahal to Rahul, FOUR, poor delivery and Rahul does not miss out. Drifts this leggie too far down leg and it is easy pickings for Rahul, he kneels down and sweeps it fine to the left of short fine leg",Chahal to Rahul,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,17.3,"Navdeep Saini to Nair, FOUR, neatly done. The dipping slower delivery, Nair moves around in the crease, gets inside the line and crouches a bit to scoop it over short fine leg",Navdeep Saini to Nair,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,17.5,"Navdeep Saini to Rahul, FOUR, 116.8kph and Rahul is waiting for it. Saini has to mix it up. This one had width as well, Rahul throws his bat at the right time to bisect backward point and short third man",Navdeep Saini to Rahul,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,18.2,"Steyn to Rahul, FOUR, hundred for Rahul. Fine innings from the Kings XI skipper. He has led from the front and has put his team ahead in this tie. Takes off his helmet and soaks in the applause from his team mates and owners. And does the ""I don't hear anything"" celebration that he does. Full delivery outside off, Rahul throws the kitchen sink and the outside edge flies over short third man",Steyn to Rahul,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,19.0,"Steyn to Rahul, FOUR, he has had luck and this proves that today is his day. Good length ball around off, Rahul clears his front leg to have a heave to the on-side, the thick inside edge races past the the stumps",Steyn to Rahul,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,19.2,"Shivam Dube to Nair, FOUR, Nair also gets into the act. Short and lacked venom, Nair gets inside the line and pulls it backward of square, he rolled his wrist to get the placement right and there was no stopping that",Shivam Dube to Nair,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,19.4,"Shivam Dube to Rahul, FOUR, that's not a bad delivery but a fine shot. Dube spears in the wide yorker outside off, Rahul makes room and opens the bat face to slice the drive behind square on the off-side, no chance for the sweeper to get across",Shivam Dube to Rahul,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,2.1,"U Yadav to Agarwal, FOUR, this man in a different zone right now - charges down and flays this inside out over extra cover for four",U Yadav to Agarwal,FOUR

5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,4.3,"Steyn to Agarwal, FOUR, a 135km/h bouncer from Steyn, but Agarwal has picked it up, rocks back and nails the pull to the deep mid-wicket boundary for four. Not the best timing on that, but he's got it away...",Steyn to Agarwal,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,5.4,"Navdeep Saini to Agarwal, FOUR, that's a terrible full-toss at a gentle 133.1km/h, and Agarwal lays into it, caressing it through the covers for four. Nobody moved...",Navdeep Saini to Agarwal,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,6.3,"Chahal to Rahul, FOUR, tossed up but drifting into the dangerous pad-line, and he's thrashed the sweep away to the backward square leg boundary for four",Chahal to Rahul,FOUR
5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,7.1,"Washington Sundar to Rahul, FOUR, not too short, skidding through very close to the stumps, and that's chopped away off a crouch to the third man fence for four!

5436138,KXIP 1st Inns,9.1,"U Yadav to Pooran, FOUR, right in the slot, wide half-volley, and Pooran has just leant into a fabulous drive through the covers. Not even a dive in the infield can cut that off...",U Yadav to Pooran,FOUR

5436138,RCB 1st Inns,10.1,"Shami to Washington Sundar, FOUR, nice late guide to this short ball, third man dives to his right and palms it on the bounce as he can't get there.

5436138,RCB 1st Inns,3.4,"Shami to Finch, FOUR, slow full toss and lofted over mid-on for the first four of the innings. That was a terrible delivery and Finch took advantage of it",Shami to Finch,FOUR

5436138,RCB 1st Inns,5.1,"Ravi Bishnoi to Finch, FOUR, too short, Finch pulls it down the ground over the mid-off fielder for a four. Shouts of catch were there but it was well away from the fielder. Even long-on tried to cut it off but couldn't",Ravi Bishnoi to Finch,FOUR
5436138,RCB 1st Inns,5.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to de Villiers, FOUR, stays back, de Villiers pulls it behind square. That was once again short and punished by de Villiers",Ravi Bishnoi to de Villiers,FOUR
5436138,RCB 1st Inns,5.5,"Ravi Bishnoi to de Villiers, FOUR, is it a four? Or has Cottrell managed to push it back into the playing area? Seems to be a four. Went really fine and the man at short fine leg gave it a good chase. ABD shows his deft side as well. He is off to a flier",Ravi Bishnoi to de Villiers,FOUR
5436138,RCB 1st Inns,6.1,"Murugan Ashwin to Finch, FOUR, sweeps it fine and sweeps it well to get it away for a four. That was well down leg and Finch helped himself to a boundary by placing it to the fine leg fence",Murugan Ashwin to Finch,FOUR
5436138,RCB 1st Inns,8.1,"Murugan Ashwin to de Villiers, FOUR, floated up outside off and has been spanked past cover for a four. That was hit really hard and the man at deep cover despite trying his best just couldn't stop it",Murugan Ashwin to de Villiers,FOUR
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,11.3,"Avesh Khan to du Plessis, FOUR, neat hit that to this short of length delivery. Wristed that behind square at the last minute to pick up the backward square leg gap. No chance for the man at fine leg",Avesh Khan to du Plessis,FOUR
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,12.2,"Mishra to du Plessis, FOUR, in the airrr, and in the gap! Is this Faf's day? He hasn't timed everything as well as Sharjah or Abu Dhabi! This time he ran down the pitch and had a wild swing at the lofted drive, good from Mishy to push it outside off stump and force Faf to fetch that, leading edge actually and it flew between cover and point. Dhawan didn't cut the angle and was slow to take off, he assmued the man at cover would grab that",Mishra to du Plessis,FOUR
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,13.1,"Avesh Khan to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, oh that is quite a flick shot off the back foot. Wasn't all that short to be honest, he flicked that off the kneeroll! My word! Somehow generated enough power to beat the deep mid-wicket fielder",Avesh Khan to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,13.3,"Avesh Khan to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, in the airrrr and just over the leaping Nortje at mid-off. Jadhav jumped down the pitch and flat-batted that short of length delivery, hit it flat, Nortje is tall, tried his best there but it escaped.",Avesh Khan to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,14.1,"Rabada to du Plessis, FOUR, that's an audacious pull shot from du Plessis to his countrymen. KG tried the slower delivery but dropped it short, Faf played the, aah let it come pull shot over the infield over mid-wicket",Rabada to du Plessis,FOUR
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,14.3,"Rabada to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, now deft touch from Kedar, oh that's beaten third man near the fence. Faf was shouting run, run, run.. to Kedar, who was so confident and just jogging. He was right. Third man was wide and he couldn't cut it off. That's one problem of having pace up your sleeve, batsman sometimes use it to their advantage",Rabada to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,16.1,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, FOUR, low full toss and he's lofted that with such calmness. No real rush to power that ball, just placed it perfectly back over the ump's head and no chance for the men in the deep",Avesh Khan to Dhoni,FOUR
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,16.4,"Avesh Khan to Dhoni, FOUR, oh no! Not there! Avesh Khan tried to nail the leg stump toe-crusher but bowled a low full toss down leg, Dhoni happily helps it away to fine leg for four",Avesh Khan to Dhoni,FOUR
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,17.4,"Rabada to Jadeja, FOUR, guided, in the air but in the gap between short third man and backward point. Jadeja used pace on that short of length delivery really well",Rabada to Jadeja,FOUR
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,2.0,"Axar to Vijay, FOUR, this by no means looked convincing. Vijay backed away to open up the off-side field, Patel fired it within the stumps and Vijay was committed to go for it. Dragged it off the cue-end and hits it uppishly, just manages to clear mid-on and earns a boundary",Axar to Vijay,FOUR
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,3.1,"Avesh Khan to Watson, FOUR, he's welcomed into the attack with a boundary. Went fuller just outside off, Watson goes hard and sort of squirted it off the inner half, miscued it airly and it flies past Rabada's dive at mid-on. No point chasing it as it scurries away to the fence",Avesh Khan to Watson,FOUR
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,5.1,"Nortje to du Plessis, FOUR, not too smart bowling from Nortje. Drifting onto du Plessis's pads, too easy for Faf as he just gets inside the line and tucks it past square leg. The timing is good enough to fetch him a four there",Nortje to du Plessis,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,0.3,"Chahar to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, yup, cover, punch, high-elbows, covers. Typically Shaw. Spots the back of a length early and rocks behind in his crease to not over-hit this crunch, perfectly through the point and extra cover gap",Chahar to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,0.4,"Chahar to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, pitched up this time with a bit of away swing. Shaw leans forward, and stays just as elegant -- drilling this cover drive with a louder crunch",Chahar to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,10.3,"Chawla to Dhawan, FOUR, pressure on the spinners as the openers are in complete control. Boundaries coming from both ends. Dhawan gets to the pitch of this delivery and whacks it over the bowler's head for four runs. Chawla is running out of ideas",Chawla to Dhawan,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,11.4,"Jadeja to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, Delhi have just lost a wicket, but that's not going to affect Shaw. He'll keep playing his shots.

2412742,DC 1st Inns,13.1,"Jadeja to Pant, FOUR, typical Pant. Down on his knee in a flash as he picks the floated delivery to perfection. Enough elevation behind this scoop-like shot, with a lot more power behind. Almost went the distance at fine leg",Jadeja to Pant,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,14.4,"Chahar to Pant, FOUR, impeccable timing behind this cover drive, and even Faf du Plessis can do nothing about it. Touch fuller outside off and it has been absolutely creamed through the huge gap on the off side",Chahar to Pant,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,15.1,"Sam Curran to Pant, FOUR, that was not needed. Dhoni wouldn't be happy with that. Pant had eased this one back to the bowler and Curran has a needless overthrow to give them four bonus runs. Would have been a dot ball, but he threw it down leg and Dhoni had no chance",Sam Curran to Pant,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,16.4,"Chahar to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, not an impressive delivery by Chahar. He has sprayed a full toss on the pads in his quest to attempt the yorker. Easy pickings for Shreyas Iyer was flicks it away to the deep square leg fence. That went flat and for a moment it seemed as if this will go the distance. Alas, it didn't",Chahar to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,17.2,"Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR, misfield by Kedar Jadhav at sweeper cover. This was absolutely smashed through the off side by Pant, but the fielder couldn't stop it in the deep. Dhoni applauds him for the effort though",Hazlewood to Pant,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,17.5,"Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR, and Pant is exactly doing that. On a length around off, Pant picks the length early and chips it over extra cover for a cracking four",Hazlewood to Pant,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,19.2,"Hazlewood to Pant, FOUR, smashed! In the slot outside off and Pant has thumped it right over the bowler's head, can't keep a fielder there, can you?",Hazlewood to Pant,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,19.4,"Hazlewood to Stoinis, FOUR, first-ball four for Stoinis. Shuffles in the crease, moves miles across the crease and drags the short ball from outside off and manages to get it past the man at short fine leg",Hazlewood to Stoinis,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,19.5,"Hazlewood to Stoinis, leg byes, FOUR, runs for Delhi! Fired outside off on a yorker length and Stoinis once again attempts a similar shot.

2412742,DC 1st Inns,3.1,"Sam Curran to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, 130.1kph, ah, too easy. Leg-lined, leg-cutter and Shaw glances it into the totally empty backward square leg",Sam Curran to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,3.4,"Sam Curran to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, 120.7kph, goes airy. Curran feeds length, and Shaw goes full-hearted, committing to slicing this easily over mid-off",Sam Curran to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,6.4,"Chawla to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, slashed through the covers .. and Chahar, chasing it from sweeper just doesn't put in the dive, merely sticking his foot out. Oh dear ..",Chawla to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,7.0,"Chawla to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, picks the gap behind square, and nails. Opening his bat face and using the sheer pace that Chawla's dishing out all over to get it perfectly out there",Chawla to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,7.4,"Jadeja to Dhawan, FOUR .. and again. Jadeja feeds it in the slog, and Dhawan slog-sweeps, more into cow corner though",Jadeja to Dhawan,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,8.2,"Chawla to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, top stuff. Chawla gets just that little fuller-than-good, and Shaw goes inside-out, without a lot of feet movement either, lofting it wide of long-off comfortably",Chawla to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,8.4,"Chawla to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, googly. But as if Shaw could care less, he's dancing down this time, making room for his arm and inside-outing it once again into that extra cover zone",Chawla to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
2412742,DC 1st Inns,9.4,"Jadeja to Dhawan, FOUR, it's his turn to inside-out. Steps away, makes room and lofts one-bounced into extra cover's ropes",Jadeja to Dhawan,FOUR

1044503,KKR 1st Inns,10.4,"Rashid Khan to Shubman Gill, FOUR, breaks the shackles in style! Swung across the line for a four. That was in the arc for Shubman Gill to thwack it through the square leg region",Rashid Khan to Shubman Gill,FOUR
1044503,KKR 1st Inns,12.3,"T Natarajan to Shubman Gill, FOUR, short delivery outside off and has been cut away past point for a four. That was delightfully done. Fifty for the young man.

1044503,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"Khaleel Ahmed to Shubman Gill, FOUR, short, wide and four, the attempted slower ball from Khaleel, but it all went wrong - sat up to be smacked, Gill backed away and then thrashed it over cover for a boundary",Khaleel Ahmed to Shubman Gill,FOUR

He charged in from third man and over-ran, put in a desperate leap in the end, but the ball was out of his reach. Goes to the fence on the bounce.

3434824,MI 1st Inns,15.0,"Chahal to Pollard, FOUR, chance? Nope, seems to have dropped just in front of Devdutt at long-off.

Four more to Pollard",Chahal to Pollard,FOUR

3434824,RCB 1st Inns,18.4,"Bumrah to Shivam Dube, FOUR, smart, really smart from Dube. Seriously can't understand Bumrah bowling short and angling outside off stump with third man in, Dube just uses the pace offered and guides past the fielder inside",Bumrah to Shivam Dube,FOUR
3434824,RCB 1st Inns,3.2,"Pattinson to Finch, FOUR, cracking shot, Finch is on a mission - back of a length and well wide of off, he swivels across and pulls it in front of square on the on-side - one bounce and over the ropes",Pattinson to Finch,FOUR

4969461,DC 1st Inns,15.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, FOUR, 122.6kph, back of a length, slow, but there's width, generous width. Stoinis stays on his back foot, and cuts away through point, beating third man comfortably",Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis,FOUR
4969461,DC 1st Inns,16.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Pant, FOUR, 120.2kph, whacks it alright. Kumar once again loses his line on the change of pace, keeping it short and wide outside off. Pant - for a change - doesn't commit early, waiting on it to slap it through sweeper",Bhuvneshwar to Pant,FOUR
4969461,DC 1st Inns,18.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rabada, FOUR, 139.5kph, full toss. Rabada slices, has his bat turning in his palms, but still has enough in it to chip it over extra cover, and beat Rashid's sliding dive from sweeper",Bhuvneshwar to Rabada,FOUR
4969461,DC 1st Inns,2.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Dhawan, FOUR, shot of the evening so far! A fuller length delivery that jagged back in a little, Dhawan charged out of his crease, gave himself some room and presented a straight bat in lifting it over the bowler's head.

4969461,DC 1st Inns,4.1,"Khaleel Ahmed to Dhawan, FOUR, Dhawan knows Iyer is biding his time, so he has to attack.

4969461,SRH 1st Inns,13.3,"Mishra to Williamson, FOUR, chipped over a leaping extra cover! Williamson was a bit in two minds as he played this, almost as an afterthought but did well to clear the infield eventually.

4969461,SRH 1st Inns,15.4,"Nortje to Williamson, FOUR, terrific placement! Fine leg and deep mid-wicket are the fielders on the leg-side boundary, so KW decides to ping that gap.

4969461,SRH 1st Inns,15.5,"Nortje to Williamson, FOUR, what a shot! Mid-off up, the length had to be a tad short but Williamson is ready for it. Stands tall and flat-bats this wide of mid-off. Lovely connection and it's raced away. Much-needed momentum for SRH",Nortje to Williamson,FOUR
4969461,SRH 1st Inns,16.3,"Stoinis to Williamson, FOUR, Williamson is unleashing himself!

4969461,SRH 1st Inns,16.4,"Stoinis to Williamson, FOUR, he is toying around with the field! Makes room this time and although it's a hard length from Stoinis, Williamson biffs it over mid-on.

4537405,CSK 1st Inns,4.5,"Khaleel Ahmed to du Plessis, FOUR, cheeky and four, a pre-meditated paddle from du Plessis, got down low, waited on the ball and then scooped it over fine leg's head, the fielder was inside the ring and has no chance",Khaleel Ahmed to du Plessis,FOUR
4537405,CSK 1st Inns,5.3,"T Natarajan to du Plessis, FOUR, clubbed, excellent use of the feet from du Plessis, waited until the ball left Natarajan's hand, shimmied down the track and then lifted it back over the umpire's head for a boundary",T Natarajan to du Plessis,FOUR
4537405,CSK 1st Inns,5.4,"T Natarajan to du Plessis, FOUR, change of tactics from du Plessis - he's going to be the aggressor - came down the track, Natarajan responded by bowling short and wide - du Plessis uses his reach and thwacks it back over the umpire's head for another boundary",T Natarajan to du Plessis,FOUR
4537405,SRH 1st Inns,0.5,"Chahar to Manish Pandey, FOUR, edged and four! Full away swinger and draws Manish Pandey into a drive away from the body, Pandey goes hard and the edge goes flying down to the third man fence",Chahar to Manish Pandey,FOUR
4537405,SRH 1st Inns,1.3,"Sam Curran to Manish Pandey, FOUR, anything pitched up and Manish Pandey is not gonna let it go scot-free. Maintains solid base and crunches the loft over mid-off, Sam Curran's pace takes care of the rest",Sam Curran to Manish Pandey,FOUR

4537405,SRH 1st Inns,15.0,"Dwayne Bravo to Abhishek Sharma, FOUR, cracking shot, too full and too wide of off from Bravo, almost a half-volley length and Abhishek can get under it on the drive - has enough power to clear mid-off and rolls away to the ropes",Dwayne Bravo to Abhishek Sharma,FOUR
4537405,SRH 1st Inns,16.0,"SN Thakur to Priyam Garg, FOUR, lovely - Garg is making most of this opportunity to bat time - had a part in the run-out of KW, but that hasn't figured in his plan since - tad too short and he's very quick on the pull, swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it over square leg for a boundary",SN Thakur to Priyam Garg,FOUR
4537405,SRH 1st Inns,16.3,"Sam Curran to Priyam Garg, FOUR, beautifully played, a touch of class from Garg - overpitched and well wide of off, he leant into the drive, opened the bat-face at the last moment and sliced the drive behind square on the off-side for a boundary",Sam Curran to Priyam Garg,FOUR
4537405,SRH 1st Inns,16.4,"Sam Curran to Priyam Garg, no ball, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for Garg - this is a no-ball for height as well - high full-toss outside off, Garg makes room and lifts it over backward point for a boundary",Sam Curran to Priyam Garg,FOUR
4537405,SRH 1st Inns,16.5,"Sam Curran to Priyam Garg, FOUR, cute, Garg is taking Curran to the cleaners - another proper cricketing shot, back of a length and well wide of off, he waited on it, opened the bat face and ran it behind square on the off-side, third man was inside the ring and has no chance",Sam Curran to Priyam Garg,FOUR
4537405,SRH 1st Inns,17.1,"Chahar to Abhishek Sharma, FOUR, chance and dropped - and it's by RJ of all people - length ball outside off and Sharma swiped it over square leg. RJ ran across to his left, got there with plenty of time, got both hands and then let the ball burst through - to add insult to injury, it dribbled over the ropes",Chahar to Abhishek Sharma,FOUR
4537405,SRH 1st Inns,17.4,"Chahar to Priyam Garg, FOUR, top-edge and four, banged in short and just outside off, Garg was a tad late on the pull, the ball caught the fat top-edge and lobbed over MS for another boundary",Chahar to Priyam Garg,FOUR

8969749,RCB 1st Inns,1.0,"Jofra Archer to Finch, FOUR, lifts this over the in-field on the off-side. Finch is off the mark with a four. This should ease his nerves a bit. Too short, too wide and Finch will not let this go scot-free. Rides the bounce and makes hay",Jofra Archer to Finch,FOUR
8969749,RCB 1st Inns,1.3,"Unadkat to Devdutt Padikkal, FOUR, bashed over mid-wicket. The shot of a man in prime form. Not all that short from Unadkat, but Padikkal quickly read the length, camped back and took heavy toll of it",Unadkat to Devdutt Padikkal,FOUR
8969749,RCB 1st Inns,11.3,"Unadkat to Devdutt Padikkal, FOUR, deft! 108.7kph, slower ball around off, Padikkal spots it, waits for the ball and opens his bat-face at the last moment to guide it cheekily fine of the man at short third man.

8969749,RCB 1st Inns,12.2,"Riyan Parag to Kohli, FOUR, slapped over extra cover! That went like a bullet. Kohli shimmies down the pitch and Parag shortens his length. There's ample width and Kohli flayed it powerfully!",Riyan Parag to Kohli,FOUR
8969749,RCB 1st Inns,15.1,"Jofra Archer to Devdutt Padikkal, FOUR, 142.6kph, short ball from Archer, it was on the stumps.

8969749,RCB 1st Inns,17.1,"Tom Curran to Kohli, FOUR, wow! A fullish ball at 133.8kph, Kohli shimmies down the pitch, converts it into a half-volley and drives it exquisitely straight of the mid-off fielder.

8969749,RCB 1st Inns,17.5,"Tom Curran to Kohli, FOUR, 124.4kph, slow, short and wide. Kohli stands tall and throws his bat at it. Gets a fat top-edge that flies over the short third man fielder. Uthappa did run back and dived but to no avail",Tom Curran to Kohli,FOUR
8969749,RCB 1st Inns,18.0,"Tom Curran to Kohli, FOUR, 16 runs off the over! Kohli is in a hurry to finish this match. Another slower ball, shortish in length, Kohli gets behind the line by shuffling across and pulls it nicely over backward square leg",Tom Curran to Kohli,FOUR
8969749,RCB 1st Inns,19.1,"Tom Curran to de Villiers, FOUR, low full toss, de Villiers crouches a bit and batters it to the right of Jofra at mid-on. Runs away to the fence and RCB win by 8 wickets",Tom Curran to de Villiers,FOUR
8969749,RCB 1st Inns,2.2,"Shreyas Gopal to Finch, FOUR, yes, he was right. It's indeed the googly but Gopal errs in length, getting it too short and following the batsman. Finch backed away too far but manages to hack it past square leg",Shreyas Gopal to Finch,FOUR
8969749,RCB 1st Inns,3.2,"Jofra Archer to Devdutt Padikkal, FOUR, that's a poor delivery from Archer. Easy pickings for Padikkal. Drifts it on the pads, Padikkal moves across and just helps it fine past the man at 45",Jofra Archer to Devdutt Padikkal,FOUR
8969749,RCB 1st Inns,4.3,"Shreyas Gopal to Kohli, FOUR, Kohli's first boundary of IPL 2020! Whodathunk.. He's been having a lean patch and Gopal offered him a freebie.

8969749,RCB 1st Inns,5.3,"Tom Curran to Devdutt Padikkal, FOUR, superb from Padikkal. Doesn't overhit this short ball, just waited for it and lifted his one leg to unleash a short-arm pull past the fielder at short fine leg.

8969749,RCB 1st Inns,5.5,"Tom Curran to Devdutt Padikkal, FOUR, brute force. Nipping away outside off, plenty of room to free his arms and Padikkal seizes.. slapping it over extra cover with enviable timing!",Tom Curran to Devdutt Padikkal,FOUR
8969749,RCB 1st Inns,8.0,"Tom Curran to Kohli, FOUR, that's clumsy from the fielder at extra cover. This should've been stopped. I guess Lomror is the culprit, Smith ain't happy. A fuller length delivery just outside off, Kohli just sublimely drives it crisply and sends it to extra cover where Lomror couldn't get his body in-line and fumbles. It scurries away to the boundary",Tom Curran to Kohli,FOUR
8969749,RCB 1st Inns,8.2,"Rahul Tewatia to Kohli, FOUR, wow! Those magical wrists of Kohli coming into play. Went back upon seeing this darter on leg, just swatted it across the line through square leg and pierces the gap to perfection",Rahul Tewatia to Kohli,FOUR
8969749,RR 1st Inns,0.2,"Udana to Buttler, FOUR, loose ball and Buttler has put it away. On the pads, shortish and Buttler walks down to tuck it away easily wide of short fine leg who was a bit off the mark too. VK isn't amused with that",Udana to Buttler,FOUR
8969749,RR 1st Inns,1.0,"Udana to Smith, FOUR, this is poor from Udana. He's getting the slow nature of the deck to assist him but instead of bowling tigher, feeds a boundary ball. Fed on the pads with fine leg up, Smith isn't missing out. Shuffles across and glances it wide of that fielder in the ring",Udana to Smith,FOUR
8969749,RR 1st Inns,1.2,"Washington Sundar to Buttler, FOUR, third boundary of the innings and all have been to the same area - fine leg. Quicker one from Sundar, probably put off a bit by Buttler's initial walk down the pitch and it's fed on the pads. Swept away past short fine leg",Washington Sundar to Buttler,FOUR
8969749,RR 1st Inns,12.4,"Zampa to Riyan Parag, FOUR, finally connects one! A tossed up delivery on middle and leg, Riyan Parag waits for it to arrive and powers is past Zampa. Straight as an arrow as this one races away to the fence in double quick time..",Zampa to Riyan Parag,FOUR
8969749,RR 1st Inns,18.0,"Navdeep Saini to Jofra Archer, FOUR, french-cut by Jofra Archer as he swings hard and gets an inside edge on the full toss. The fielder at fine leg was inside the ring, hence this was an easy boundary",Navdeep Saini to Jofra Archer,FOUR
8969749,RR 1st Inns,2.2,"Udana to Buttler, FOUR, can't bowl short to Buttler at this pace, Udana! Gonna get punished for sure.

8969749,RR 1st Inns,2.5,"Udana to Samson, FOUR, how is that for a start? Gentle half-volley from Udana alright but look at that execution from Samson. Just leans into the drive and caresses the drive wide of mid-off. Class!",Udana to Samson,FOUR
8969749,RR 1st Inns,7.0,"Zampa to Uthappa, FOUR, brilliant effort by Gurkeerat at long-on! Raced across to his left and dived full-length but couldn't do much. Seemed like a mishit from Uthappa initially, went hard on the halfvolley from Zampa but did well to go dead straight down the ground. One bounce into the ad hoardings",Zampa to Uthappa,FOUR
8969749,RR 1st Inns,9.3,"Navdeep Saini to Lomror, FOUR, this is great awareness from Lomror. Saw mid-off was up and wanted to get this past the fielder.

4947883,DC 1st Inns,0.4,"Cummins to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, full pitched at the stumps, Shaw - with his high backlift - punches it sweetly over mid-on. With his flourish as it is, if the timing is good, he doesn't need to worry about clearing the infield",Cummins to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR

4947883,DC 1st Inns,12.0,"Chakravarthy to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, and a boundary to finish..

4947883,DC 1st Inns,14.0,"Cummins to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, shot! Cummins tries the same full wide delivery to Iyer but ends up conceding the boundary.

4947883,DC 1st Inns,15.1,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, FOUR, Cummins was straighter at mid-off but Pant still manage to beat him. Full delivery outside off, Pant swings through the line past Iyer and Cummins had no chance of getting across",Shivam Mavi to Pant,FOUR
4947883,DC 1st Inns,15.3,"Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, oh no! Cummins has made a mess of it. Meanwhile, Iyer reaches his fastest IPL fifty. He has to bat through and ensure his side get the total they need. Full delivery on middle and leg, Iyer flicks it uppishly to wide long-on, the ball lands just in front of Cummins and he ends up overrunning the ball.",Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
4947883,DC 1st Inns,15.5,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, FOUR, smashed! 141.2kph short of length delivery outside off, Pant sets himself up nicely and slaps it hard over extra cover, goes flat and almost all the way",Shivam Mavi to Pant,FOUR
4947883,DC 1st Inns,16.0,"Shivam Mavi to Pant, FOUR, not sure he intended that to go there but he won't mind it.

4947883,DC 1st Inns,16.4,"Cummins to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, oh no! Even good deliveries are going for runs. Sloppy bit of work from Narine.

Cummins is not impressed with the effort",Cummins to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
4947883,DC 1st Inns,16.5,"Cummins to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, hammered! He is putting on a show here. Keeps moving around in the crease, makes room as the ball is delivered and drives it with his weight on the back leg, pierces the gap between extra cover and mid-off",Cummins to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
4947883,DC 1st Inns,17.3,"Russell to Pant, FOUR, that's poor planning. He goes short with square leg and fine leg inside the ring, even the mistimed pull from Pant races away to the fence",Russell to Pant,FOUR
4947883,DC 1st Inns,17.4,"Russell to Pant, FOUR, Pant looks at the base of his bat. He knows that it didn't come off the middle. Full toss outside off and Pant swings it away in front of square on the leg-side, wide of the long-on fielder",Russell to Pant,FOUR
4947883,DC 1st Inns,18.1,"Chakravarthy to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, first ball has disappeared to the fence.

4947883,DC 1st Inns,2.4,"Cummins to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, Cummins hits 151kph as he pounds it in on short of length, and is pulled over midwicket. Shaw didn't quite get hold of it though. Definitely a little rushed for pace. But enough meat on it",Cummins to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4947883,DC 1st Inns,3.5,"Chakravarthy to Dhawan, FOUR, Dhawan barely has a followthrough on this cover-drive, but the timing is sublime. Smears it over cover. Chakravarthy went too full there",Chakravarthy to Dhawan,FOUR
4947883,DC 1st Inns,5.1,"Chakravarthy to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, Shaw seems like he's picking him. Or maybe it's just premeditated. Backs away to a length ball, it turns away from him and he cuts through cover",Chakravarthy to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4947883,DC 1st Inns,8.0,"Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, driven hard enough to burst through Mavi's hands. Races away to the boundary. It wasn't an obvious drive-ball so to say, but it might as well be over here.",Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR
4947883,KKR 1st Inns,1.1,"Nortje to Narine, byes, FOUR, 138.7kph, sharp bumper first up, Narine is beaten - courtesy pacy and bounce. He is in no control to pull and misses it comfortably. Fies over the keeper's leap too",Nortje to Narine,FOUR

9843066,SRH 1st Inns,1.3,"Pattinson to Bairstow, FOUR, absolutely smashed! Bairstow premeditates the length and charges down the track, holds his shape and nails the pull over mid-wicket. Total nonchalance",Pattinson to Bairstow,FOUR
9843066,SRH 1st Inns,1.4,"Pattinson to Bairstow, FOUR, Pattinson is losing his radar a bit here and probably, confused with his lengths too. Goes very full but it's on the pads, Bairstow gets a tickle on it. More of the inside half and it beats de Kock down the leg-side",Pattinson to Bairstow,FOUR
9843066,SRH 1st Inns,10.3,"Krunal Pandya to Warner, FOUR, Pandya goes for the yorker, misses his length by an inch or two and Warner takes heavy toll of it. The skipper gets under it and lofts it over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four",Krunal Pandya to Warner,FOUR
9843066,SRH 1st Inns,13.0,"Boult to Warner, FOUR, 110.8kph, slow, short and wide. Warner backs away and slaps it fiercely over extra cover. Couple of bounces and into the fence. Still a good over for Mumbai as they managed to nip out KW",Boult to Warner,FOUR
9843066,SRH 1st Inns,17.0,"Bumrah to Abdul Samad, FOUR, four to end the over! 142.7kph, very full and wide of off, Samad shuffles across and superbly slices it over backward point. Pattinson runs to his right in the deep, but puts in a lousy effort to stop that. Bumrah wears a cheeky smile on his face, sure he didn't like it",Bumrah to Abdul Samad,FOUR
9843066,SRH 1st Inns,4.3,"Boult to Manish Pandey, FOUR, he's getting into the act straightaway. Perhaps a slower ball again from Boult, this is fuller though and Pandey waits for it, before dispatching it straight down the ground",Boult to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9843066,SRH 1st Inns,4.5,"Boult to Manish Pandey, FOUR, probably another slower ball but this is a fraction short and sits up for Pandey who pulls this over mid-wicket. Picks his spot and gets a boundary",Boult to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9843066,SRH 1st Inns,5.1,"Bumrah to Warner, FOUR, first time that Warner has tried to time the ball and he gets rewarded instantly. Short and angling across him, he just uses Bumrah's pace to steer it between short third man and backward point",Bumrah to Warner,FOUR
9843066,SRH 1st Inns,5.2,"Bumrah to Warner, FOUR, and again! Much better from Warner, not so from Bumrah. Short again and allows the left-hander to free his arms. Punches this on the up and splits the gap at cover. This should get the SRH skipper going",Bumrah to Warner,FOUR
9843066,SRH 1st Inns,5.5,"Bumrah to Manish Pandey, FOUR, how about that for timing? Geez! A fairly good delivery from Bumrah, angles this on a good length and Pandey just pushes it with a straight bat past the bowler. Just a gentle-looking push but it speeds across the turf to the fence in no time. Wow!! Shot of the day?",Bumrah to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9843066,SRH 1st Inns,7.3,"Pollard to Manish Pandey, FOUR, Hardik puts down a dolly! The catching in this IPL hasn't been good at all. This is another instance of a superb fielder spilling an easy chance. Was short and wide, bowled cleverly by Pollard and Pandey tried to upper-cut it. Doesn't get the distance and Hardik at sweeper overruns the ball. What's worse, it's gone to the fence. He has his sunglasses on so no excuse of the sun in the eyes either",Pollard to Manish Pandey,FOUR
9843066,SRH 1st Inns,9.1,"Pattinson to Warner, FOUR, this is excellent batting! Not that bad a ball from Pattinson, on a good length around off stump but Warner backs away early to make room. And then uses the pace to steer it between short third man and backward point",Pattinson to Warner,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,0.3,"Cottrell to Watson, FOUR, 134.2kph, strays on the hips. Okay, this should help Watson, it better help Watson, with free runs off a fine leg-glance",Cottrell to Watson,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,0.4,"Cottrell to Watson, FOUR, that's more Watto-like. A big forward plonk, leaning under the length and lofting this punch over mid-on",Cottrell to Watson,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,10.1,"Jordan to Watson, FOUR, strays on the hip and Watson picks it away wide of short fine leg. Jordan isn't very pleased by the effort. Basically there was no effort",Jordan to Watson,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,10.2,"Jordan to Watson, FOUR, oh that's vintage Watson. Reaches fifty by planting his foot down to a length ball and crashing it through extra cover. Comforting sight for the dugout",Jordan to Watson,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,11.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Watson, FOUR, overpitches outside off, Watson muscles the drive wide of long-off. Doing it in a canter",Ravi Bishnoi to Watson,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,14.2,"Harpreet Brar to du Plessis, FOUR, Punjab aren't going to turn this around with these deliveries. Short at the stumps, Faf crunches the pull between long-on and midwicket",Harpreet Brar to du Plessis,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,16.0,"Ravi Bishnoi to Watson, FOUR, spoils a good over by pitching it too full. It's a blistering drive through extra cover from Watson",Ravi Bishnoi to Watson,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,16.4,"Jordan to du Plessis, FOUR, full toss outside off, Faf flays it over point. Now the highest partnership for CSK in IPL",Jordan to du Plessis,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,16.5,"Jordan to du Plessis, FOUR, yorker outside off, runs away fine past short third man. Faf reached out to it and got it right off the toe-end. What a miserable return for Jordan this is turning to be",Jordan to du Plessis,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,17.4,"Shami to du Plessis, FOUR, low full toss outside off, driven through extra cover. The sweeper gives up. It's a 10-wicket hammering",Shami to du Plessis,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,2.5,"Cottrell to Watson, FOUR, it's in the slot, it's in Watson's arc, and he makes sure he plonks in front and smokes this downtown, and makes sure he makes it look seriously brutal",Cottrell to Watson,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,3.3,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, FOUR, overpitches. There's no one straight down in the deep, and Watson easily gets under this one to go over, typically",Harpreet Brar to Watson,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,4.1,"Shami to du Plessis, FOUR, there's an entirely empty deep mid-wicket, so Faf walks across his stumps and tucks this uppishly with a lot of bottom hand into that area. Just timing, checked timing",Shami to du Plessis,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,5.2,"Jordan to du Plessis, FOUR, neatly ramped. A cutter from Jordan, which Faf's spotted early, shuffling big time and sitting under to scoop it over the keeper",Jordan to du Plessis,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,5.4,"Jordan to du Plessis, FOUR, again, not off the middle, but he's managed enough chunk on this inside-halved-pull between mid-wicket and mid-on",Jordan to du Plessis,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,5.5,"Jordan to du Plessis, FOUR, overcompensates with width this time. Now, now. Faf slices, over and wide of short third man with nobody behind",Jordan to du Plessis,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,6.0,"Jordan to du Plessis, FOUR .. and CSK have officially arrived. 19 off this over, with a forehand smash down the ground. He made room, made sure he was on top of the the in-angling short one and muscled it wide of mid-on. It's Jordan's birthday, and this is the equivalent of birthday bumps ..",Jordan to du Plessis,FOUR

8460906,CSK 1st Inns,7.2,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, FOUR, Watson steps across and paddle-scoops this off the stumps. Long chase for Cottrell running across from long leg. Puts in a big dive but to no avail",Harpreet Brar to Watson,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,7.3,"Harpreet Brar to Watson, FOUR, this won't help. This won't help Punjab at all. Swept straight to Shami at short fine leg, but he doesn't even get a hand on it. Right through the legs.",Harpreet Brar to Watson,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,7.5,"Harpreet Brar to du Plessis, FOUR, advances down, gets beside the ball, lofts it over extra cover. Lovely batting",Harpreet Brar to du Plessis,FOUR
8460906,CSK 1st Inns,8.2,"Ravi Bishnoi to Watson, FOUR, almost got himself in trouble looking to pull a ball that wasn't very short. It skids through off a length, headed towards middle and leg.

8460906,KXIP 1st Inns,1.3,"Sam Curran to Rahul, FOUR, there's a sweeper cover in place, but he can't do nothing about it. Full and wide outside off and Rahul creams it past the fielder with impeccable timing and incredible placement",Sam Curran to Rahul,FOUR
8460906,KXIP 1st Inns,12.2,"Dwayne Bravo to Rahul, FOUR, an edge and that has fetched him a boundary. Was a slower delivery outside off and Rahul got an outside edge on his drive.

8460906,KXIP 1st Inns,19.2,"SN Thakur to Sarfaraz Khan, FOUR, wide yorker, and really nothing wrong with this. There was a deep third man and a backward point as well. But still, Sarfaraz's found a way to angle his bat out and squeeze it extremely fine",SN Thakur to Sarfaraz Khan,FOUR
8460906,KXIP 1st Inns,2.3,"Chahar to Rahul, FOUR, lovely cut! Back of a length outside off, width on offer and Rahul plays a fine square cut as the ball races away through the backward point region for four runs",Chahar to Rahul,FOUR
8460906,KXIP 1st Inns,3.4,"Sam Curran to Agarwal, FOUR, Agarwal is riding his luck. Slightly up outside off, this one seams away from the batsman who flays at it and gets an outside edge that flies over short third man. Fleming's reaction in the balcony depicts how desperate CSK are for a win..",Sam Curran to Agarwal,FOUR
8460906,KXIP 1st Inns,4.0,"Sam Curran to Rahul, FOUR, just the kind of over Punjab needed to get going. 12 runs off it as Rahul square drives the slightly full ball through point and manages to beat the sprinter in the deep. Rahul knocked over Curran at the other end as his eyes were on the ball. The little guy is on the floor..",Sam Curran to Rahul,FOUR
8460906,KXIP 1st Inns,4.2,"Chahar to Agarwal, FOUR, smashed! Full length delivery outside off and Mayank absoutely belts it over covers as he finds the boundary once again. Went flat and almost cleared the boundary on the full",Chahar to Agarwal,FOUR

4491659,DC 1st Inns,0.3,"Udana to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, 123.7kph, harmless short of length ball. Shaw doesn't need second invitations to put it away. The right-hander stands tall, fetches it from outside off and pulls it fiercely in front of square on the leg-side. Off the mark with a boundary",Udana to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,0.5,"Udana to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, slower ball, full on leg and middle, Shaw picks it and brings his wrists into play. Flicked away through the gap between mid-wicket and mid-on. Second boundary of the over",Udana to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,1.0,"Udana to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, make that three! Poor stuff from Udana. He shortens his length and strays it on leg, wristily tucked away through backward square leg. 14 runs off the over",Udana to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,12.2,"Chahal to Pant, FOUR, Pant will take on Chahal even with the long boundaries. Flighted outside off, Pant is down on his knee and launches the slog sweep over mid-wicket, since it is a big side of the ground, the ball bounces inside the rope",Chahal to Pant,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,14.0,"Moeen Ali to Stoinis, FOUR, the extra deliveries cost him a boundary. 15 off the over and a much needed one for Delhi. This was also quicker but right in the slot, Stoinis smacks it straight down the ground for a one bounce four",Moeen Ali to Stoinis,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,14.4,"Navdeep Saini to Stoinis, FOUR, Stoinis is on fire here. Remember he is playing against his old franchise. Length delivery and Stoinis swings through the line, not off the middle but goes straight and collects a one bounce four",Navdeep Saini to Stoinis,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,14.5,"Navdeep Saini to Stoinis, FOUR, just over the fielder. Saini proving to be expensive today, already gone for 29 in 11 balls.

4491659,DC 1st Inns,15.1,"Siraj to Stoinis, FOUR, dipping full delivery around off, Stoinis moves across, waits for the ball to arrive and then drills it hard past extra cover. No chance for the sweeper to get across and stop it",Siraj to Stoinis,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,16.2,"Navdeep Saini to Stoinis, FOUR, Stoinis is picking his gaps for fun here. The full delivery isn't working for him, stays deep in the crease and manages to whip it away to deep mid-wicket, Padikkal has no chance this time",Navdeep Saini to Stoinis,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,16.5,"Navdeep Saini to Pant, FOUR, superb, sensible batting. Saini is all over the shop.

4491659,DC 1st Inns,17.3,"Udana to Pant, FOUR, miscued but it was in the gap. Slower delivery outside off, Pant is through the shot a bit early and ends up slicing it over extra cover, the ball has enough to beat a chasing Finch from long-off",Udana to Pant,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,19.0,"Siraj to Stoinis, FOUR, fifty for Stoinis. That's his second of the season and it has been a brutal innings. Apart from the first ball, it was a decent over from Siraj. He went full and wide outside off, Stoinis moves across and whips it in front of square. The shot was on as fine leg and square leg were inside the ring. He raises his bat and soaks in the applause of his team mates",Siraj to Stoinis,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,2.1,"Navdeep Saini to Dhawan, FOUR, a gift first up from Saini and Dhawan gleefully accepts it. A wide, half-volley outside off at 139.9kph, Dhawan throws his arms and flays the drive through the covers. Sped away to the fence",Navdeep Saini to Dhawan,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,4.2,"Chahal to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, that's a freebie from Chahal. A flat leggie at 89.4kph, on the shorter side too. Shaw clears his front leg and slaps it through the covers. Authoritative shot",Chahal to Prithvi Shaw,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,4.5,"Chahal to Dhawan, FOUR, Delhi have decided to go after RCB's best bowler. Leg-stump line, Dhawan crouches and slog-sweeps it over backward square leg for a one-bounce four",Chahal to Dhawan,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,5.4,"Washington Sundar to Prithvi Shaw, FOUR, Washington Sundar concedes his first boundary of the match. Shaw shuffles and gets low to slog-sweep.

4491659,DC 1st Inns,6.2,"Siraj to Dhawan, FOUR, that's a hit-me delivery. Siraj shortens his length and there's not much pace or bounce to threaten the batter. Dhawan gets into a strong position and pummels the pull in front of square on the leg-side",Siraj to Dhawan,FOUR
4491659,DC 1st Inns,6.5,"Siraj to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, Siraj welcomes Iyer with a gift by doling out a leg-stump half-volley at 140kph. The skipper, who is in great form, gets off the mark with an easy flick off his pads through backward square leg",Siraj to Shreyas Iyer,FOUR

4491659,RCB 1st Inns,19.2,"Harshal Patel to Navdeep Saini, FOUR, boom. With 24 runs needed per ball, Saini's managed one-sixth, but it's a night time one-sixth. Backing away, getting under Patel's full one and swinging downtown",Harshal Patel to Navdeep Saini,FOUR
4491659,RCB 1st Inns,3.1,"Axar to Kohli, FOUR, he announced his return to form in the previous game, and here's another superb shot. Gets off the mark on the first ball of the innings as he creams the floated delivery through covers with sublime timing",Axar to Kohli,FOUR
4491659,RCB 1st Inns,4.1,"Harshal Patel to Kohli, FOUR, easy pickings for Kohli! This was speared down the leg side by Harshal Patel and the skipper flicks it past the man at short fine leg with nonchalance. 9000 runs in T20 cricket for Kohli, informs Sunny G on air..",Harshal Patel to Kohli,FOUR
4491659,RCB 1st Inns,5.0,"Harshal Patel to de Villiers, FOUR, that was in the air for a while, but just eluded the man at mid-off.

3130666,MI 1st Inns,1.0,"Rajpoot to Rohit, FOUR, lovely, poor line and length from Rajpoot, can't offer width with third man inside the ring - Rohit waits on the ball, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and guides it behind square on the off-side for a boundary",Rajpoot to Rohit,FOUR

3130666,MI 1st Inns,15.1,"Tom Curran to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, neatly done! Fifty for Suryakumar. First of the season for him.

3130666,MI 1st Inns,16.1,"Jofra Archer to Hardik Pandya, FOUR, stand and deliver! Mid-off was inside the ring. Archer offers width on the back of a length and Hardik flat-bats it straight past the fielder at mid-off",Jofra Archer to Hardik Pandya,FOUR
3130666,MI 1st Inns,17.0,"Jofra Archer to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, good improvisation there from Suryakumar. Mumbai needed a boundary to make it a good over. He moves inside the line, gets under the back of a length delivery and helps it over short fine",Jofra Archer to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR

3130666,MI 1st Inns,18.0,"Tom Curran to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, 19 off the over.. That's the big one Mumbai wanted. Curran goes for the slower back of a length stuff, Suryakumar walks across, gets inside the line and laps it over short fine leg",Tom Curran to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR

3130666,MI 1st Inns,19.3,"Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav, FOUR, that's brilliant cricket. Suryakumar moved across early and Rajpoot followed him with a full toss, but the batsman adjusted and scooped it over short fine, one bounce and over the ropes",Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav,FOUR
3130666,MI 1st Inns,2.3,"Rajpoot to Rohit, FOUR, cracking shot, Rajpoot is proving to be expensive - back of a length and wide of off, Rohit waits on it and then cuts it late, beats the sliding effort of the fielder running across to his left from deep point",Rajpoot to Rohit,FOUR
