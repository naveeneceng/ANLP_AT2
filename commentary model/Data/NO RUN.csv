7898444,MI 1st Inns,17.3,"Dinda to Pollard, no run, was that a drop? Need another look. Wide yorker outside off, Pollard bends down to squeeze it out, the ball takes the under-edge and goes low to Dhoni's right. The former skipper goes with one hand and spills it. Tough one for Dhoni and Dinda's unlucky day continues, second drop off his bowling",Dinda to Pollard,NO RUN
7200146,GL 1st Inns,13.3,"Nehra to Dwayne Smith, no run, brilliant work from Henriques. A direct-hit would've been interesting. A fuller length delivery on the stumps, Smith pushes it meekly towards extra cover, Moises dives to his right and throws at the non-striker, all in one motion. DK was backing up for a single and had to turn back and dive full-length to make his ground",Nehra to Dwayne Smith,NO RUN
7200146,GL 1st Inns,17.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, no run, oh nearly.. A communication breakdown between both the batsmen almost resulted in a run-out. A short of length delivery outside off, Karthik slashed it straight to point, Kulkarni set off for a single, DK was ball-watching and sends him back. Yuvi, the fielder, was slow to react and fires a throw at the non-strikers end, misses the target and Kulkarni survives",Bhuvneshwar to Karthik,NO RUN
7200146,GL 1st Inns,5.0,"Rashid Khan to Raina, no run, edged and dropped, that was a chance and Warner at first slip has missed it. It was a tough opportunity though, Raina went with hard hands, the edge was flying and to the right of the captain, he went with hard hands and shells it. Coming to the ball, it was tossed up invitingly outside off, another wrong 'un from Rashid, lured Raina into the mistake - but Raina survives",Rashid Khan to Raina,NO RUN

9873957,MI 1st Inns,13.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Pollard, no run, uh oh! A bad mix-up there with Pollard being sent back from the middle of the pitch. But he makes it home. The throw isn't a great one from Pathan either. Rana called him initially but then backtracked as Pollard steered it to point. These are nervy times",Kuldeep Yadav to Pollard,NO RUN
2604889,RCB 1st Inns,3.2,"Sandeep Sharma to Vishnu Vinod, no run, yes-no and the last thing RCB want is for Vinod to run AB out. Thankfully no damage done. He defends this back of a length delivery towards cover-point and blindly sets off, AB rightly sends him back and Stoinis' throw wasn't accurate at the striker's end",Sandeep Sharma to Vishnu Vinod,NO RUN
2604889,RCB 1st Inns,7.2,"Mohit Sharma to Mandeep, no run, another yes-no and Mandeep escapes. A direct-hit would have seen him walk back. He wanted to drive this short of length delivery through cover, got an inside edge to Amla at mid-wicket, AB shouts and sends him back, the throw was wide of the stumps",Mohit Sharma to Mandeep,NO RUN
2172197,RPS 1st Inns,14.2,"Zaheer to Dinda, no run, has Karun plucked a one-handed stunner? The third umpire is called for, the soft call is OUT. Looked like a good catch on first view. Has the ball touched the ground, has he got his fingers underneath? The third umpire is having a look at different angles, this will be a tricky call. NOT OUT it is. Fair call, looked like the ball might just have touched the ground as Karun plucked it. Coming to the ball, it was full and shaping away, squared up Dinda as he was looking to work it towards the on-side, the edge flew to the left of first slip. Karun stuck his left hand out and claimed the catch",Zaheer to Dinda,NO RUN
8517839,GL 1st Inns,2.5,"SN Thakur to Brendon McCullum, no run, hit straight back at Thakur who puts it down. Half a chance here. McCullum had timed that beautifully and the ball was travelling. But it came at a nice height in the followthrough. Thakur parries it towards mid-off",SN Thakur to Brendon McCullum,NO RUN
8351592,DC 1st Inns,14.1,"Cariappa to Corey Anderson, no run, almost thumped it back to Cariappa. Flatter offie around, Anderson hangs back and punches it straight down the wicket, did not keep it down the ground, Cariappa is late to react, the ball hits his upper part of his hand and goes to ground. Tough chance but should have been taken",Cariappa to Corey Anderson,NO RUN
9515142,RCB 1st Inns,1.2,"SN Thakur to Kohli, no run, Tiwary drops Kohli. Oh you can't do that. Thakur hits the pitch hard on a back of a length outside off, Kohli dangles a horizontal bat and edges it for a simple catch to first slip where Tiwary makes a meal of it",SN Thakur to Kohli,NO RUN
2969824,DC 1st Inns,13.4,"Narine to Nair, no run, dropped! The penalty you pay for fielding a part-time wicket-keeper. The flatter knuckle ball around off, Nair moved away to the leg-side and tried to force it off the back foot, the outside edge goes straight in and straight out of Uthappa's gloves. That would have been two set batsmen removed in one over",Narine to Nair,NO RUN
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,3.0,"Zaheer to M Pandey, no run, rib-tickler this time, tucked straight to short fine. Wanted a single but wisely sent back by his partner. A direct-hit from Morris would've been close",Zaheer to M Pandey,NO RUN
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,11.0,"Nabi to Axar, no run, spills a return catch. Axar hits it straight back at him but it's not coming too fast and the height is pretty comfortable too. He should have taken it",Nabi to Axar,NO RUN
1005940,SRH 1st Inns,16.3,"Chris Morris to Dhawan, no run, direct hit and Yuvraj would have had a diamond duck to his name. Very full and on leg-stump, Dhawan misses the flick and is rapped on the pads, the ball rolls to the left of Morris and Yuvraj was backing up for the run. Dhawan sends him back and Morris fires a throw which is off-target",Chris Morris to Dhawan,NO RUN
9478272,GL 1st Inns,4.3,"Narine to Raina, no run, dropped! The odds of this happening are high when you field a non-regular keeper. Raina pokes at a turning off-break and gets an outside edge. Uthappa fails to gobble it up. How costly is that going to be?",Narine to Raina,NO RUN
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,11.1,"Stokes to Warner, no run, dropped, it's the Australian captain who has dropped his vice-captain. An Englishman looks aghast. Length delivery outside off, Warner got a big stride forward and drilled it straight to Smith at mid-off, in and out, that was a sitter",Stokes to Warner,NO RUN
1169775,MI 1st Inns,2.0,"Chris Morris to Buttler, no run, dropped by Rishabh Pant! Buttler went too far across his off-stump and tried the scoop, he may have played that stroke a touch too early. Spoons it straight to the keeper who was late to pick the ball as the ball swirled around him to distract his attention. Oh, boy!",Chris Morris to Buttler,NO RUN
7614896,MI 1st Inns,11.2,"Tahir to Karn Sharma, no run, oh Tiwary. He puts down another. This time it goes right in, only to pop out. A fierce slap this from Karn finding extra cover to perfection. Just that the catch cannot stick in his palms tonight",Tahir to Karn Sharma,NO RUN
7614896,MI 1st Inns,4.5,"Stokes to Nitish Rana, no run, did that carry to Tiwary? Oh what a big wicket that would have been. Round the wicket, slanting the ball in on a back of length and getting it to straighten a touch. Rana fences it to slip. Oh, this is close. It might have just fallen short. Centimetres",Stokes to Nitish Rana,NO RUN
4118946,DC 1st Inns,16.2,"Kuldeep Yadav to Corey Anderson, no run, lucky is Corey Anderson! That was scooped back to the bowler who lets it pop out. Dolly of a catch it was as the batsman pushed it back on the clipped drive",Kuldeep Yadav to Corey Anderson,NO RUN
8703679,SRH 1st Inns,5.0,"Axar to Warner, no run, dropped! Quicker delivery outside off, Warner cuts it and gets a thick outside edge. Saha couldn't hold onto the catch. Wasn't an easy one either",Axar to Warner,NO RUN
9007667,DC 1st Inns,15.0,"Aaron to Rabada, no run, chance and dropped. Shaun Marsh is the culprit, he had two bites at the cherry, but can't hold on. Length delivery outside off, Rabada drilled it towards cover, Marsh tumbled to his right and let the ball slip, he was alert though, turned around and tried to grab the rebound, but can't do so. He had it for a moment, but the ball popped out as his elbows hit the ground",Aaron to Rabada,NO RUN
9316064,MI 1st Inns,8.0,"Shami to Parthiv Patel, no run, direct hit at the striker's end and Parthiv Patel was gone. But as luck would have it, Cummins missed the target. It was again a short ball and Parthiv Patel went for the pre-meditated hook, could not get behind the shot and ended up deflecting off the face of the bat toward mid-wicket. Was blinded through the motion and did not spot where the ball went. Heard the call late but was back in time",Shami to Parthiv Patel,NO RUN
4724289,MI 1st Inns,11.3,"S Kaul to Hardik Pandya, no run, a direct-hit would have been curtains for Rohit. Pandya stands tall and punches it straight to cover. Henriques, there, makes a sharp stop and has a shy at the stumps at the bowler's end. Rohit was nowhere in the frame",S Kaul to Hardik Pandya,NO RUN
4724289,SRH 1st Inns,11.4,"Harbhajan to Henriques, no run, put down. Oh Harbhajan. Gets the ball to stick on the surface making Henriques stand back and check his push. Chips it meekly in the end off a straight batted defence, straight to the bowler. Doesn't quite anticipate the sharp dip on this does Bhajji as he barely stoops low. An out-popper",Harbhajan to Henriques,NO RUN
9401301,RCB 1st Inns,16.1,"Zaheer to Kohli, no run, just doesn't stick. Zak has to give himself the stare here. Lets off the big man after inducing him into a false stroke. Misreads the slower one here does Kohli and is way early into a whack. Chips it back to the bowler, who in his followthrough gets both palms to it. Just doesn't stick",Zaheer to Kohli,NO RUN
4211071,DC 1st Inns,5.0,"Mujeeb to Shreyas Iyer, no run, a review for LBW. Looks high to the naked eye but gee that's hit Shreyas Iyer on the back pad, above the knee roll. Carrom ball I think, which skids on instead of turning away. Beats the batsman for pace and goes through Iyer, who's standing on his back foot to meet that. Ball-tracking is in and it's umpire's call on height, as suspected",Mujeeb to Shreyas Iyer,NO RUN
4211071,KXIP 1st Inns,5.0,"Mujeeb to Shreyas Iyer, no run, a review for LBW. Looks high to the naked eye but gee that's hit Shreyas Iyer on the back pad, above the knee roll.

1206999,RCB 1st Inns,11.1,"Johnson to de Villiers, no run, appeal for caught behind and he's been given. AB reviews immediately. He checks with the umpire about what the decision was for. The umpire informs him he's given him caught behind. There was a noise as the ball passed the bat, but clearly the ball just touched the flap of the pad and was nowhere close to the bat or glove. It was a short of length delivery outside off stump, de Villiers tried to guide that to third man and missed. DRS saves de Villiers",Johnson to de Villiers,NO RUN
9131817,SRH 1st Inns,1.0,"D Kulkarni to Dhawan, no run, edged and dropped. ""One of the safest fielders in the slips has dropped a catch"" is the comment from Sanjay Manjrekar on air. Huge moment in the game. Guess who's the culprit? It's skipper Ajinkya Rahane. A simple regulation take - length delivery angled across outside off. Dhawan aiming to break the dots slashes hard and outside-edges it straight to first slip. Jinks gets both hands but shells it. Kulkarni is in disbelief",D Kulkarni to Dhawan,NO RUN
5641860,CSK 1st Inns,11.1,"Narine to Dhoni, no run, Narine is a smart operator and he will mix it up. Important to read him from the hand rather the surface. Dhoni did not pick the off-break and lunged forward to nudge it into the on-side, beaten on the inside edge and struck around the kneeroll. The big press forward helped him there as ball-tracking showed it to be going over",Narine to Dhoni,NO RUN
5989339,SRH 1st Inns,4.4,"Krunal Pandya to Saha, no run, was that a chance? Saha backed away and Pandya followed him. Got a bit of turn and Saha missed the cut. The keeper failed to catch it cleanly. Not sure if there was any bat involved",Krunal Pandya to Saha,NO RUN
1505006,DC 1st Inns,19.5,"Mustafizur to Roy, no run, a hat-trick of dots, you are kidding me! Slower delivery again that spins across, Roy pokes at it and misses. MI review just like that, obviously no edge on that. Gee this is unbelievable stuff",Mustafizur to Roy,NO RUN
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,16.0,"Chawla to Deepak Hooda, no run, now then, there's a review from KKR for leg-before. Hooda didn't pick a googly from Chawla and was hit on the back pad. But in real time, it looked like the impact may have been outside off. Oh wait, there's an inside edge too. So that's that",Chawla to Deepak Hooda,NO RUN
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,10.0,"Nadeem to Nitish Rana, no run, Nadeem is jumping for an lbw appeal. Does not get it and Gambhir takes it. To the naked eye, looked like an under edge. Need UltraEdge to confirm. No bat. So we move on. Impact? Outside the line and that is such a poor review and DD burn their only review. Was very full to be sweeping, Nitish Rana went for it and managed to get himself outside the line",Nadeem to Nitish Rana,NO RUN
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,12.1,"Shami to Karthik, no run, DK has been given out lbw. By umpire Nand Kishore. Looks a dodgy decision. That's why the KKR skipper went for the review straight away. UltraEdge shows a big spike and the crowd cheer. Huge inside edge onto the pads. How did Nand Kishore miss that? Shami was pumped, but all that celebration now turns sour! Was a length delivery cutting back in, raps Karthik above the kneeroll, but there was an edge before that",Shami to Karthik,NO RUN
9886489,MI 1st Inns,18.2,"Woakes to Hardik Pandya, no run, a peach. Oh it doesn't get better. And to imagine it coming in the death in the midst of an onslaught. Oh and amidst all this noise, the umpire's heard a tickle. He's given him caught behind. But Pandya isn't amused, he goes up instantly. Why bother consulting your partner with 10 balls to go in the day. And UltraEdge is a murmur all through, but when it passes the bat it gets a little bigger. The sound's deaf. Oh and forget the spikes, the third umpire overturns",Woakes to Hardik Pandya,NO RUN
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,14.3,"Unadkat to Nitish Rana, no run, slower length ball on off, Rana defends back towards the bowler and sets off for a single. Ridiculous judgement. Karthik obviously sends him back, but even a dive wouldn't have saved him if Unadkat had hit the stumps direct. Michael Clarke calls it the worst attempted single in the history of cricket",Unadkat to Nitish Rana,NO RUN
2583918,KXIP 1st Inns,2.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rahul, no run, good use of the technology by Rahul! He was very sure that he had hit it and UltraEdge confirms the inside edge. He was stuck on the crease to this inswinger and got pinged on the back leg. Cannot fault the umpire for raising his finger because if not for the edge, it was dead plumb",Bhuvneshwar to Rahul,NO RUN
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,0.2,"Barinder to Saha, no run, Punjab have gone for a review. My naked eyes tell me this is high and it might be going down the leg side. Saha is jumping in the crease when ball strikes him on the back pad. It is clipping the stumps -- the top of middle and leg -- but just clipping so it is umpire's call and Punjab retain their review. Good inward shape from Barinder on that back of a length ball",Barinder to Saha,NO RUN
2583918,SRH 1st Inns,9.1,"Mujeeb to Williamson, no run, Punjab have gone for a review. Williamson is a long way down the ground. Ultra edge shows no edge and DRS shows ball is just hitting the leg stump. Punjab retains the review again. Williamson comes down the track on the ball and misses the bat totally, ball hits his pads",Mujeeb to Williamson,NO RUN
8353877,RR 1st Inns,0.2,"Chahar to Klaasen, no run, dropped! Deja vu! Watto was dropped in the first over at first slip and he does the same now. A beautiful delivery from Chahar. Seam-up delivery on a good-ish length that decks away a tad and Klaasen dangled his bat out. The thick outside edge carries to Watson, but that's been put down. Klaasen survives. The centurion wasn't quite ready - was late to react",Chahar to Klaasen,NO RUN
8353877,RR 1st Inns,2.2,"Chahar to Rahane, no run. Another appeal for lbw and this time CSK decide to review. Fair delivery. The knuckle ball and Rahane didn't pick it. Was early into the shot and got struck on the back thigh. Was there any bat involved? A light spike on the UltraEdge. An inside edge. CSK lose their only review. It was on a length and Rahane walked forward to work it through the on-side. Didn't pick it, on that occasion did Rahane",Chahar to Rahane,NO RUN
7791285,DC 1st Inns,15.0,"Siraj to Pant, no run, Siraj appeals for LBW. But that ball had clearly pitched outside leg. Pant winds up for a big mow by clearing his front leg, was beaten for pace as he missed the heave to the leg-side, pinged on the back thigh where there is no protection. He is down on the ground grimacing in pain. Meanwhile, RCB take the review and waste it. Not sure who prompted them to challenge the decision as it had pitched miles outside leg. Nonetheless, the good thing for DD is Pant is back on his feet and is ready to resume..",Siraj to Pant,NO RUN
4976077,CSK 1st Inns,12.4,"Shakib to Rayudu, no run, Saha completed the catch and went up immediately. Shakib joined him as well. Williamson trusting his players challenged the decision, but it remains with the onfield call. Rayudu steps out and is tucked by the drifter, misses the nudge into the on-side and the ball lobs off the pad to the left of Saha. He moves across to catch that",Shakib to Rayudu,NO RUN
7308498,RR 1st Inns,7.2,"Mustafizur to Stokes, no run, Mustafizur is excited but that looks high. Traps Stokes on the shuffle with this delivery. Oh they've gone for the review. It's hit the knee-roll bang in front of off-stump, so the impact is alright. But as we doubted, the bounce in this Jaipur deck is taking the ball over the stumps -- the ball-tracking confirms. So not out it'll be and Mumbai lose their review",Mustafizur to Stokes,NO RUN
7710423,DC 1st Inns,1.0,"Rajpoot to Gambhir, no run, Ashwin reviews. Makes sure first with the keeper that it was straight enough and then goes for it. Last ball from Rajpoot was the one that shaped away and beat Gambhir, and this straightened and slithered on to rap Gambhir's front pad's flap. But tell you what, this is just a bit naff, this review. Pitches almost a foot outside leg-stump, and it's not out -- just as the on-field umpire thought",Rajpoot to Gambhir,NO RUN
7710423,DC 1st Inns,13.0,"Barinder to Shreyas Iyer, no run, the appeal was so loud and confident that the umpire was under a lot of pressure, fair on KXIP's part because they thought it was a genuine edge, but the fact that Shreyas Iyer immediately smiled and reviewed clearly suggested he didn't hit this. Maybe the ump should have originally given the benefit of doubt to the batsman, because the bat also hit the ground. Wide yorker, Shreyas Iyer tried to squeeze, missed it completely and there's no spike on UltraEdge. Review saves Shreyas Iyer",Barinder to Shreyas Iyer,NO RUN
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,15.1,"Mishra to Miller, no run, now Prithvi. Oh these catches keep going down -- the simplest of them. Miller is foxed by the wrong 'un, again, as he goes deep in the crease to some-sort-cut. Chipped up, straight to extra cover in the ring. Shaw gets both hands, perhaps closing them a little too early. Debut nerves",Mishra to Miller,NO RUN
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,10.0,"Markande to Y Pathan, no run, that is a very ambitious appeal for lbw. Pathan is a huge man and with that big stride of his, always will get his front foot outside the line, this one is the leggie and the impact looks outside off and what's more it is spinning away. Hang on - MI have taken the review. Could well lose it. Replays show that the impact is outside off and that's MI's review gone down the gutter",Markande to Y Pathan,NO RUN
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,5.0,"Rajpoot to Manish Pandey, no run, chance and Tye has dropped a dolly. That should have been four for Rajpoot, short and just outside off, Manish swivelled across and nailed the pull, straight into the hands of Tye at mid-wicket - who somehow clangs a sitter",Rajpoot to Manish Pandey,NO RUN
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,0.1,"Boult to Watson, no run, drama that is what kick-starts match number 30. That looked close. The ball nipped in and struck the pads. Bat first is what the third umpire reckoned and Watson survives. That was mighty close. That looked dead but the on-field umpire said it not out and rightly so as there seemed to be a faint inside edge",Boult to Watson,NO RUN
3981825,MI 1st Inns,19.0,"Bumrah to de Grandhomme, no run, yorker outside off, de Grandhomme fails to get bat on ball. Ishan Kishan fumbles and CdG looks for a quick bye, comically he loses balance and stumbles to get back. Ishan Kishan misses and the Kiwi gets away",Bumrah to de Grandhomme,NO RUN
3981825,RCB 1st Inns,19.0,"Bumrah to de Grandhomme, no run, yorker outside off, de Grandhomme fails to get bat on ball. Ishan Kishan fumbles and CdG looks for a quick bye, comically he loses balance and stumbles to get back. Ishan Kishan misses and the Kiwi gets away",Bumrah to de Grandhomme,NO RUN
2353730,DC 1st Inns,3.0,"D Kulkarni to Prithvi Shaw, no run, dropped! RR and dropped catches of openers has cost them bad! That was a low full toss and the batsman drove it back. Kulkarni juggled it and the ball popped out like a pop-corn. Did Kulkarni get too excited?",D Kulkarni to Prithvi Shaw,NO RUN
2353730,RR 1st Inns,10.3,"Plunkett to R Tripathi, no run, Tripathi misses the ball again and it strikes him on the pads, DD go for a LBW review. Actually it was a win-win review for DD, or so Iyer thought. Plunkett had taken the return catch, which meant that even an inside edge and Tripathi was out. DRS shows the the ball missed the bat and was going down the leg-side clearly, so DD lose their review too",Plunkett to R Tripathi,NO RUN
2353730,RR 1st Inns,2.0,"Boult to D Arcy Short, no run, Short has been given out but he has taken the review instantly. Short is spot on as ball has hit his hip, and not the bat as he swatted into a pull. Umpire will change his decision. It was a short of length delivery, D Arcy Short was beaten by the pace and ball defeats him and goes to the keeper.",Boult to D Arcy Short,NO RUN
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,5.5,"Chawla to Raina, no run, was there a nick? There was a certain deviation and also, a faint noise. I guess, the reaction of Chawla suggests that there was an edge. So, will go down as a drop. Guess, who's the culprit? It's the skipper, DK. Googly, turning away from Raina, who went for the drive. Scraps the outside edge, straight in and out of DK's gloves. Costly drop? Surely",Chawla to Raina,NO RUN
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,1.5,"KM Asif to Narine, no run, dropped! Can you believe it? CSK's best fielder has put one down. Narine slapped the shortish delivery to mid-off where Jadeja spills it out. He tried to take it on the second attempt too, but failed even then",KM Asif to Narine,NO RUN
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,2.0,"KM Asif to Narine, no run, second dropped catch! This is unbelievable really. Is this Narine's night? Went hard at a shortish delivery and miscued it to Jadeja at mid-off. He jumped in order to take it but failed yet again. But you know Narine, he'll give you more chances",KM Asif to Narine,NO RUN
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,15.4,"McClenaghan to Axar, no run, direct-hit and Nair would've been on his way back to the hut. Patel gets an inside edge onto his pad, the ball drops into the off-side. McClenaghan rushes forward, collects the ball and sees Nair stuttering at the middle of the pitch. Picks up and rifles a throw at the non-striker's end, but misses the target",McClenaghan to Axar,NO RUN
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,12.4,"de Grandhomme to Dwayne Bravo, no run, chance and Parthiv has shelled it, it was a tough chance, he was standing up to the batsman, on a good length and well wide of off, Bravo went for the flamboyant drive, got a feather and Parthiv grabbed at that, it popped out and he had a second bite at the cherry, but can't hold on",de Grandhomme to Dwayne Bravo,NO RUN
4811184,DC 1st Inns,12.3,"Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer, no run, Saha has dropped it! Could have been the second wicket for Rashid. Iyer tried to work that short delivery away to the on side but got a thick inside edge. Saha behind the wickets makes a mess of it as the Delhi skipper gets a life",Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer,NO RUN
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,5.2,"Hardik Pandya to Uthappa, no run, chance and dropped, that's a dolly and Markande has somehow dropped it. Then slower short ball outside off, Uthappa swivelled across on the pull, doesn't get hold of the shot and hit it straight to mid-on. It came at a very good height, Markande went reverse cupped and somehow let the ball pop out",Hardik Pandya to Uthappa,NO RUN
2957424,MI 1st Inns,19.5,"Prasidh to Hardik Pandya, no run, low full toss and Pandya swings so hard that the bat flies out of his hand, he then tries to steal a bye with the bat lying near square leg and Karthik misses to run him out. He was gone by a mile, in the end they don't even go through with the run",Prasidh to Hardik Pandya,NO RUN
9414123,KXIP 1st Inns,6.0,"Stokes to Rahul, no run, fuller length delivery and Rahul hits it straight to cover, he wanted a single but Akshdeep Nath wasn't interested at all. And when the fielder picked up the ball Rahul was almost in the mid crease, he had given up but throw was wayward and Rahul gets away with it",Stokes to Rahul,NO RUN

It brushes the thigh pad and flies to PP to his left, Kohli checked with his bowler and keeper and then went up for the review",Steyn to Kedar Jadhav,NO RUN
7225586,RCB 1st Inns,19.3,"Dwayne Bravo to Moeen Ali, no run, that was full, wide, Moeen Ali threw his bat it and misses. There was a noise, MS went for the DRS but there was nothing on the UltraEdge. Mo continues..",Dwayne Bravo to Moeen Ali,NO RUN
7436247,RR 1st Inns,4.2,"Axar to Rahane, no run, Ishant spills a sitter! Embarrassing stuff from DC's senior man. Rahane shuffled well across for the sweep and skewed it aerially to short fine leg. Straightforward take but Ishant spills it. How costly will this be?",Axar to Rahane,NO RUN
6274749,RCB 1st Inns,1.1,"Shami to Kohli, no run, dropped! Hardus Viljeon is the fielder. Full and swinging into the pads, Kohli unleashes his whippy wrists and sends a dolly of a catch to mid-wicket where Viljeon makes an absolute Bisi Bele Bath (dal rice) out of it. Oh dear!",Shami to Kohli,NO RUN
3681433,RR 1st Inns,6.0,"Narine to Smith, no run, Smith went for an across the line shot, and he was hit on the pads. He just managed to get an inside edge to it and that saved him there. An excellent over from Narine",Narine to Smith,NO RUN
3681433,RR 1st Inns,7.5,"Narine to Riyan Parag, no run, Narine drops an absolute dolly. You can't expect an easier catch than this. And he has no one else to blame. It spins back into Riyan Parag who chips it straight back to Narine. But he wasn't expecting it at all and ends up spilling it",Narine to Riyan Parag,NO RUN
9570712,RR 1st Inns,6.4,"Rashid Khan to Livingstone, no run, Very fancy shot to attempt off someone like Rashid who fizzes the ball through. But the impact is probably just outside off which has saved him. SRH aren't convinced with the umpire's call, so they go for a review. Only to waste it. Flat leg-break just outside off, Livingstone wanted to scoop it over the keeper's head, but wasn't able to connect",Rashid Khan to Livingstone,NO RUN
7266994,KKR 1st Inns,5.2,"Malinga to Chris Lynn, no run, Pollard drops it! It was an off-cutter on a back of a length, Chris Lynn wanted to clear mid-off but he mistimed it badly. Pollard at mid-off dives dramatically to his right but fails to time his dive to perfection and ends up spilling it",Malinga to Chris Lynn,NO RUN
6119894,MI 1st Inns,13.1,"Basil Thampi to Hardik Pandya, no run, fuller length delivery swerving down leg, Hardik shuffled a bit in a bid to flick it fine but couldn't make any contact. It skims the outer half of the pad en route to the keeper",Basil Thampi to Hardik Pandya,NO RUN
6649951,RCB 1st Inns,14.5,"Basil Thampi to Gurkeerat Singh, no run, SRH have gone for a review for a caught behind. There is surely gap between the bat and the pad. And I will be very surprised, if something comes up in UltraEdge. There is nothing on UltraEdge. And SRH will lose their review too. It was a brilliant delivery nevertheless, it was on a good length and it snaked back in after hitting the deck. Gurkeerat Singh played it down the wrong line and it went between his bat and pad. Manish Pandey strangely heard something and he was the one who pushes Williamson to go for the review!",Basil Thampi to Gurkeerat Singh,NO RUN
1927753,CSK 1st Inns,11.3,"Tye to Raina, no run, a dipping slower delivery from Tye, Raina didn't pick it as he misses the flick and overbalances a touch. Tye was confident enough to convince his skipper to go for the review but it was confirmed by UltraEdge that there was a clear inside edge",Tye to Raina,NO RUN
1927753,KXIP 1st Inns,13.3,"Dwayne Bravo to Pooran, no run, dropped by the substitute, Vijay! A wide and full one, Pooran gets forward and lashes it square, straight to Vijay at point where Vijay spills a rgulation chance",Dwayne Bravo to Pooran,NO RUN
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,0.1,"Boult to Saha, no run, excellent use of technology and Saha survives! Height was the factor that could have saved him but in the end, inside edge does. Was a lovely nipbacker from Boult that pinged Saha on the back pad. Didn't look dead plumb but the umpire was impressed and raised his finger. After a chat with Guptill, Saha opted for the DRS and it has saved him in the end",Boult to Saha,NO RUN
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,10.3,"Mishra to Williamson, no run, a chance and Pant has dropped it, that was a regulation catch and Pant didn't go down with the ball - stood tall and fluffed it - the leg-break and Williamson pushed at it, straight in and out of Pant's gloves",Mishra to Williamson,NO RUN

8026316,CSK 1st Inns,13.5,"Rahul Chahar to Watson, no run, oh is that a dropped chance? Yes it was. It's the set Watto. Full delivery on the stumps, Watson drives hard and hits it back at the bowler, who doesn't accept the offer",Rahul Chahar to Watson,NO RUN
8026316,CSK 1st Inns,6.3,"McClenaghan to Raina, no run, Raina given out on the field, but he's reviewed it. He got into a terrible position against a cracking bouncer from McClenaghan, just left his hands up there, and according to umpire Gould it brushed his glove on the way. But there's nothing on Ultra-Edge. However, the third umpire still goes through to check if there's any visible deflection. That's interesting. Still, he can't find much to uphold the onfield call. So the decision will have to be overturned",McClenaghan to Raina,NO RUN
8026316,MI 1st Inns,8.2,"Harbhajan to Ishan Kishan, no run, just short of Raina at cover, dropped short and wide of off, Kishan made room for the punch and didn't bother to keep it down, almost carried to cover as raina tumbled forward",Harbhajan to Ishan Kishan,NO RUN
5554057,CSK 1st Inns,18.5,"Bumrah to Dhoni, no run, Dhoni reviews a caught behind: You'd think when he reviews from behind the stumps, he'd know when he hasn't nicked it. It was the typical strategy -- short, incoming bouncer, which MS pulls and apparently gloves away to the keeper. Nope, clear daylight between glove and ball, and more daylight between bat and ball. But there was a noise, which probably was his clicking bat",Bumrah to Dhoni,NO RUN
5554057,MI 1st Inns,13.4,"Chawla to Saurabh Tiwary, no run, CSK review for LBW, but looks like it was missing off stump, or maximum shaving off stump. Umpire's call will do for the batsman. Was the googly, so tough to be out LBW from over the wicket, oh yes, ball-tracker says missing off stump. Tiwary went for the big sweep and missed",Chawla to Saurabh Tiwary,NO RUN
4286363,SRH 1st Inns,11.5,"Chahal to Manish Pandey, no run, the keeper got excited as soon as he caught the ball and that induced a review from Kohli. Big legbreak from Chahal and Pandey looked to flay it flat on the off-side, misses it by a whisker and there was a slightest bit of deviation after pitching which got RCB excited",Chahal to Manish Pandey,NO RUN
3533313,CSK 1st Inns,17.3,"Tom Curran to du Plessis, no run, that's an inch-perfect yorker, dug-out from between his legs away to short fine leg - Faf is down, gets up and tries to run across, but there's a shy at the striker's end.

5436138,RCB 1st Inns,3.5,"Shami to Finch, no run, Is Finch gone? The umpire has given him out caught behind. But Finch was quick to review it. That nipped in, Finch pushed at it and seems to have missed it. Mostly it went off the pads and into the keeper's gloves. Not out is the verdict and Finch is safe. Even he was safe on the LBW call as it was missing the wickets",Shami to Finch,NO RUN
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,2.3,"Nortje to Watson, no run, dropped. Pops out of Shaw's hands at square leg like a bar of soap. He got a lifeline when he was batting and now this. Karma eh? A strong wristy whip from Watson, hitting it on the up and straight to Shaw, who couldn't lock his hands in time and grasses it. Watson will breathe easy.. you can't drop these catches at this level",Nortje to Watson,NO RUN
1044503,SRH 1st Inns,3.5,"Cummins to Bairstow, no run, fullish just outside off, Bairstow sits low outside off looking to scoop it over short fine leg. Loses his balance and it flies off the pad to short third man. DK calls for it and grabs. Appeals and the finger went up. Bairstow knew he didn't hit it, so got it overturned",Cummins to Bairstow,NO RUN
1044503,SRH 1st Inns,9.3,"Chakravarthy to W Saha, no run, it was the slider, Saha stayed back and didn't pick it. Played it outside the line, gets trapped on the back leg. Oh, it was the googly in fact.. close shave for Saha",Chakravarthy to W Saha,NO RUN
3434824,RCB 1st Inns,2.3,"Boult to Finch, no run, chance and Rohit has dropped it - fair to say, he has saved four runs - short and just outside off, Finch rocked back and drilled the pull, to the left of mid-wicket.

2173525,MI 1st Inns,17.0,"Shami to Pollard, no run, Pollard reviews! He was adjudged lbw here by the umpire, but he has straight away signaled for a review. Think there was some bat on it, as I look at the replays. Was a low full toss on leg that Pollard failed to middle. Luckily for him there was some bat on it. So the onfield decision has to be overturned. The original decision was out, hence although he got some bat on it, it will be called as a dead ball",Shami to Pollard,NO RUN
2173525,MI 1st Inns,2.0,"Shami to Rohit, no run, Mumbai review this given LBW: Full, straightening back in off the pitch, and Rohit's trapped on the front pad in his crease. But, but, the impact's in front of leg-stump, and ball-tracking shows it to be going down leg. False alarm, and Rohit will stay there",Shami to Rohit,NO RUN
8969749,RR 1st Inns,18.5,"Udana to Jofra Archer, no run, chance of a run-out, but Udana has made a mess of it. Tewatia was almost at the striker's end when Archer asked him to go back. But, Udana couldn't get rid of the ball quickly. Had he gone for a direct-hit at the bowler's end, Tewatia could have been in trouble. The throw wasn't an impressive one, as he parried it away towards the fielder who was charging in from mid-off. Was delivered on the pads as Jofra Archer failed to connect his flick",Udana to Jofra Archer,NO RUN
4947883,DC 1st Inns,19.5,"Russell to Hetmyer, no run, this is excellent stuff from Russell. Another short ball that is banged into the surface, he slants it across the left hander and Hetmyer cannot connect with the pull, the ball flies under his bat",Russell to Hetmyer,NO RUN

He has also hurt his finger in the process..",Mishra to Nitish Rana,NO RUN
9843066,MI 1st Inns,18.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Hardik Pandya, no run, a loud shout for LBW and SRH will review. The angle means this ball must have pitched outside leg. Think so, can see all the three stumps, no bat for sure and UltraEdge confirms it. But it has pitched marginally outside leg and SRH lose their review. Good delivery to complete the spell, the slower dipping yorker from round the wicket, Hardik was looking to shovel it over the leg-side and is done by the late dip, struck low and in front of the leg-stump",Sandeep Sharma to Hardik Pandya,NO RUN
4491659,RCB 1st Inns,0.2,"Rabada to Finch, no run, Rabada drops it! Such an easy caught and bowled chance, but KG has put it down.
