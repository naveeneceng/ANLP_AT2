7898444,MI 1st Inns,20.0,"Dinda to Hardik Pandya, wide, out Southee Run Out!! Where was Southee going? He might have thought that it was the last ball of the innings, but Pandya was sure that it was a wide and there would be an extra delivery. Dinda fires it outside off, Pandya can't reach it and Southee was at the other end by the time Pandya could react. Dhoni lobbed it to Dinda, who took care of the rest. The third umpire checks if the batsmen had crossed, Pandya got his back foot in before Southee could reach the crease. It's touch and go, but Pandya will cling on to the strike. Southee run out (Dhoni/Dinda) 7(3) [6s-1]",Dinda to Hardik Pandya,WIDE
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,9.2,"Chahal to Y Pathan, wide, out Stumped!! A wide but Chahal has completely flummoxed Yusuf here. Big, big wicket for RCB and Kohli is thrilled to bits. He guessed Yusuf was going to come down the track, fired it faster and down the leg-side, Yusuf was in no position to lay bat on that. Kedar was quick to move to his left, collects the ball and whips the bails off. Yusuf doesn't even attempt to get back. Y Pathan st Kedar Jadhav b Chahal 8(8)",Chahal to Y Pathan,WIDE
1229540,GL 1st Inns,8.2,"Krunal Pandya to Karthik, wide, out Stumped!! Fast hands from PP does the trick. The ball fired down leg and the batsman missed his balance and stepped out of his crease. The rest was done by the glovesman as he didn't allow a whisker of a second for the batsman to come back. A wide for a wicket is loss of a bargain for the Lions. Karthik st Parthiv Patel b Krunal Pandya 2(8)",Krunal Pandya to Karthik,WIDE
7153825,KXIP 1st Inns,18.0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Saha, wide, out Stumped!! The teaser. And teases Saha back into the pavilion. Keeps up with his wrong 'uns, drifting them wide and slow. Saha obviously with his show of aggression was down and away once again, just that this time even the stretch out to reach the line of the ball turns futile. Robin takes over. The best extra leaked - ever. Saha st Uthappa b Kuldeep Yadav 38(33) [4s-2 6s-1]",Kuldeep Yadav to Saha,WIDE
2619288,DC 1st Inns,1.0,"Chawla to Roy, wide, out Stumped!! Smart stumping from Karthik and the last match hero falls cheaply. Nicely bowled by Chawla as well, he pre-empted that Roy was coming down the track and slid this one down the leg-side, Roy stepped forward, the momentum took him further ahead, he turned around in panic, but Karthik had by then removed one of the stumps. A cheap dismissal for Roy and Delhi have lost an early wicket. Roy st Karthik b Chawla 1(3)",Chawla to Roy,WIDE
9886489,RCB 1st Inns,9.4,"Krunal Pandya to Mandeep, wide, out Stumped!! Once bitten twice shy. No mistake whatsoever from Ishan Kishan this time. Mandeep has been hokey-pokeyed for the second time and no repreive on this occasion. Very smart from Krunal; Mandeep announced his intent of stepping out early. Krunal sees it and lasers it wide of off. Very similar to the last over, Ishan Kishan doesn't panic, grabs it cleanly and whips the bails off. RCB lose their third wicket. Mandeep st Ishan Kishan b Krunal Pandya 16(14) [4s-1]",Krunal Pandya to Mandeep,WIDE
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,19.3,"Dwayne Bravo to U Yadav, wide, had MS hit direct, would've been four in four. What was Yadav doing? Was a wide and he was loitering outside his crease. MS missed without the glove and not by much. Very lazy and poor by Umesh",Dwayne Bravo to U Yadav,WIDE
9414123,KXIP 1st Inns,2.1,"Gowtham to Gayle, wide, out Stumped!! Astute Gowtham gets the better of Gayle. Terrific plan this and equally good execution. It was fired down the leg-side, Gayle came down the track and was strangled outside the crease; Buttler behind the stumps takes off the bails quickly. Back to back failures for the universe boss against RR. Gayle st Buttler b Gowtham 1(1)",Gowtham to Gayle,WIDE
9497497,KXIP 1st Inns,18.0,"McClenaghan to Miller, wide, 50-run partnership comes up. It has been a match-winning one for Punjab. McClenaghan gets his line wrong this time, it was well down the leg-side and Miller lets it go",McClenaghan to Miller,WIDE
8616942,CSK 1st Inns,18.1,"Sam Curran to Dhoni, wide, fuller and slipped down leg-side. MS allows the ball to go through to the keeper. Ashwin has reviewed this. Was it a nick down the leg-side? It was wided and Ashwin out of the blue decided to review. Nothing of the UltraEdge and it stays as a wide. That was bizarre",Sam Curran to Dhoni,WIDE
7680387,DC 1st Inns,7.4,"Hooda to Dhawan, wide, out Stumped!! That's an excellent piece of keeping from Saha, nearly matched MSD (in terms of alertness) there. Hooda may have second guessed Dhawan's intentions and he hurled the ball miles down the leg-side and kept it short too; Dhawan was never backing away, went charging down and missed the ball completely. Looked to force himself back into the crease, but Saha did a wonderful job stretching across to take the bails off in the nick of time. Dhawan st Saha b Hooda 17(16) [4s-3]",Hooda to Dhawan,WIDE
7680387,SRH 1st Inns,19.5,"K Paul to Hooda, wide, out Hooda Run Out!! Here is what happened - Slower ball outside off, Hooda swings and misses, the umpire calls it a wide as it was away from the guide line, Rashid calls for a bye and Hooda responds, Pant throws at the bowler but Paul doesn't get there, instead Hooda trips over the bowler and goes to ground. The ball goes past them to remove the bails. There was no need of a third umpire but Ravi asked Delhi captain Iyer if he wants to continue with the dismissal. He first gave Hooda an opportunity to bat on but was convinced otherwise by Pant. Hooda run out (Pant) 4(4)",K Paul to Hooda,WIDE
4162325,MI 1st Inns,19.3,"Shivam Mavi to Pollard, wide, full delivery outside off, it was away from the tramline and Pollard threw the kitchen sink at it, but still could not make any sort of connnection. Ravi signals a wide but Karthik challenged the decision. In the end, it stays with the onfield call",Shivam Mavi to Pollard,WIDE
1044503,KKR 1st Inns,13.4,"Nabi to Morgan, wide, again down leg, Morgan misses the tuck and this time it has been wided",Nabi to Morgan,WIDE
4947883,DC 1st Inns,15.0,"K Nagarkoti to Pant, wide, another wide, tries to keep it out of the southpaw's range and sprays it too far outside off, Pant has no chance of reaching that",K Nagarkoti to Pant,WIDE
2164522,CSK 1st Inns,5.5,"Chahar to R Tripathi, wide, 115.2kph, slower shorter one, but gets too leg-sided, angling past Tripathi's attempted pull",Chahar to R Tripathi,WIDE
2164522,KKR 1st Inns,5.5,"Chahar to R Tripathi, wide, 115.2kph, slower shorter one, but gets too leg-sided, angling past Tripathi's attempted pull",Chahar to R Tripathi,WIDE
