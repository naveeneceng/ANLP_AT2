4281444,RCB 1st Inns,11.4,"Henriques to Kedar Jadhav, out Kedar Jadhav Run Out!! 1 run completed. Cutting has conjured a wicket out of nowhere. That's a sensational throw from the deep. My goodness. He's absolutely nailed the stump from long leg and Jadhav is out of here. This is a huge moment in the context of the match, especially as Jadhav was looking so good. Even this shot which he played was extraordinary. It was a length ball outside off, Jadhav sat on his back knee and scooped it over short fine leg. He was a little slow to decide on the second run, maybe a little hesitant and boy did Cutting make him pay! More than a couple of feet short, even with a dive. Kedar Jadhav run out (Cutting) 31(16) [4s-4 6s-1]",Henriques to Kedar Jadhav,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,12.5,"Rashid Khan to Head, out Caught by Yuvraj!! Rashid strikes back! That might have been the googly. Yeah, it seems so. Head went for another slog-sweep, but due to the variation, Rashid managed to generate some extra-bounce which took more of a thick top-edge and lobbed up towards long-on. It still came really close to clearing the boundary though. Yuvraj keeps his cool and takes it smartly. Head c Yuvraj b Rashid Khan 30(22) [4s-3]",Rashid Khan to Head,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,13.4,"Bipul Sharma to Sachin Baby, out Caught by Henriques!! Straight up off a leading edge, taken! SRH taking control. There's no turn on the ball as Bipul fires it on leg-stump from round the wicket, Baby swings across the line and is undone by the sliding delivery. Good catch from Henriques too. He pedalled backwards from mid-wicket and made it much easier than it should have been. Sachin Baby c Henriques b Bipul Sharma 1(3)",Bipul Sharma to Sachin Baby,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,16.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Binny, out Caught by Yuvraj!! Gone this time. Yuvraj makes no mistake at backward point. What a top over this has been from Bhuvneshwar. It may now be a mountain too high for the RCB to climb. Binny backs away to slash a back of a length delivery over point. But this is a leg-cutter which bounces spongily and he slices it up to the fielder. Binny c Yuvraj b Bhuvneshwar 11(10) [6s-1]",Bhuvneshwar to Binny,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,17.3,"Nehra to Watson, out Caught by Henriques!! That's the end of Watson, and of RCB. The little bit of reverse-swing which Nehra uses to curl the ball away from Watson does his undoing. Despite it being another full toss, Watson slices it straight up off the outside half of his bat. Simple catch at extra-cover. Watson c Henriques b Nehra 22(17) [4s-1 6s-1]",Nehra to Watson,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,17.4,"Nehra to Aravind, out Bowled!! Terrific yorker from Nehra; a perfect way to seal wicket no. 100 in the IPL for the veteran pacer. The ball tails back in, zips through Aravind before his bat could come down and plants leg-stump into its grave. Nehra on a hat-trick. Aravind b Nehra 0(2)",Nehra to Aravind,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,18.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Tymal Mills, out Caught by Warner!! Good lord, that's got air miles on it. Way up into the night sky, Warner settles under it at long-on and takes it. Bhuvneshwar had slowed the pace down on the delivery, causing Mills to go through with the hoick too early. Right off the toe-end of the bat. Tymal Mills c Warner b Bhuvneshwar 6(3) [6s-1]",Bhuvneshwar to Tymal Mills,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,19.4,"Cutting to Aniket Choudhary, out Chahal Run Out!! Direct-hit and that's it! SRH with a comprehensive win in the IPL 10 opener. Another pull shot from Choudhary, this one's straight to mid-wicket. Chahal comes running down only to be sent back and he had given up. Jordan with the bull's eye. Chahal run out (Jordan) 3(7)",Cutting to Aniket Choudhary,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,5.4,"Rashid Khan to Mandeep, out Bowled!! He strikes! The customary celebration follows. One hand up and the finger pointing skywards. The most delighted man in the dugout was his fellow countryman - Mohammad Nabi. He too had his finger up in celebration. The quicker wrong 'un and Mandeep clearly did not pick it, went back for the cut and gets cramped for room, only manages a chop onto the stumps. Mandeep b Rashid Khan 24(16) [4s-5]",Rashid Khan to Mandeep,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,6.3,"Deepak Hooda to Gayle, out Caught by Warner!! It was an experiment from Warner and it has paid off. Completes the catch, turns towards the crowd and does a fist pump. RCB have lost two in quick succession. Both set batsmen gone. Slows it up as Gayle gives the charge, he goes through with the loft even though he isn't to pitch of the ball, miscues it towards long-off and Warner ain't dropping those. Gayle c Warner b Deepak Hooda 32(21) [4s-2 6s-3]",Deepak Hooda to Gayle,OUT
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,1.4,"Aniket Choudhary to Warner, out Caught by Mandeep!! The night has changed completely for the 27-year old RCB debutant. Warner has been dismissed for less than fifty for the first time against RCB - when he's playing for SRH. On a good length and well outside off, it was there to be smacked, Warner didn't go through with the shot completely, he was just looking to clear the infield. Mandeep times his jump to perfection at point and completes a good two-handed catch. Warner c Mandeep b Aniket Choudhary 14(8) [4s-2 6s-1]",Aniket Choudhary to Warner,OUT
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,10.3,"Binny to Dhawan, out Caught by Sachin Baby!! This was coming. It really was. Tactical aggression here from SD with his dance down the track looking to smoke some into the clouds. Does everything in getting right to the pitch of this fuller one as well, swings mighty too, just that he skews it off the toe end. All the altitude and into the safe palms of Baby at long-on. Dhawan c Sachin Baby b Binny 40(31) [4s-5]",Binny to Dhawan,OUT
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,15.2,"Chahal to Henriques, out Caught by Sachin Baby!! Some normalcy restored. And as always is the case, it is spin that gets on that duty. Chahal doesn't mind giving it some air inviting the big swing. And gets just that. A full-blooded tonk down and skewed away. Almost teases Baby at the long-off fence with this one threatening to fly over, before the bucket hands facing upwards come to the rescue in plucking it out. They're checking the foot's behaviour - just inside the permissable limits. Henriques c Sachin Baby b Chahal 52(37) [4s-3 6s-2]",Chahal to Henriques,OUT
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,18.4,"Tymal Mills to Yuvraj, out Bowled!! The zings light up. The crowd refuses to believe and keep searching for the ball. Nope, that's the end of the fun in store folks. Mills for a change aims for the stumps, going slower as well. Nicely off the back of the hand and foxes him with the seam position. A swat across the line is missed eventually and the top of leg takes the brunt. This has been some serious clock roll back here. Makes me feel 10 years younger. Yuvraj b Tymal Mills 62(27) [4s-7 6s-3]",Tymal Mills to Yuvraj,OUT
7898444,MI 1st Inns,11.1,"R Bhatia to Rayudu, out Caught&Bowled!! Thank You! A typical Bhatia wicket. Foxes the batsman with a 116kph delivery and Rayudu is found checking his drive, spoons a straightforward chance and Bhatia accepts the dolly. Once again the Delhi man showing his variety and the key to his success has been the length. It was on a good length and Rayudu thought it was there for the drive. Not to be. Rayudu c and b R Bhatia 10(12)",R Bhatia to Rayudu,OUT
7898444,MI 1st Inns,13.2,"R Bhatia to Krunal Pandya, out Caught by Dhoni!! First Tahir and now Bhatia. The slow bowlers are doing it for RPS. Bhatia lets out a roar as soon as MS completes the catch. He's been exceptional with his variations. This offie was bowled at 96kph, Pandya just didn't have the pace to slog it across the line, the top-edge skies up and Dhoni calls for it. Takes it in his own unique way, one leg up in the air. Krunal Pandya c Dhoni b R Bhatia 3(5)",R Bhatia to Krunal Pandya,OUT
7898444,MI 1st Inns,15.3,"Zampa to Nitish Rana, out Caught by R Bhatia!! Bhatia has made amends. Put a sitter down early in the innings, this time keeps his eyes on the ball and ends Rana's knock. It was the googly which was drifting away from the southpaw, Rana went down and slog swept it flat, Bhatia didn't have to move at deep mid-wicket to pouch that. Nitish Rana c R Bhatia b Zampa 34(28) [4s-1 6s-2]",Zampa to Nitish Rana,OUT
7898444,MI 1st Inns,18.2,"Stokes to Pollard, out Caught by Mayank Agarwal!! Stokes gets the better of the West Indian. But credit has to go to Mayank Agarwal, he's pulled off a stunner. Length delivery and Pollard miscued his loft, came more off the base of the bat. It was dropping in front of long-on before Mayank dived full length and grasped it inches from the ground. He didn't allow it to pop out even as he hit the ground. Pollard c Mayank Agarwal b Stokes 27(17) [4s-3 6s-1]",Stokes to Pollard,OUT
7898444,MI 1st Inns,4.2,"Tahir to Parthiv Patel, out Bowled!! Knocked him over. Tahir is off with his marathon sprint. The crowd go bonkers. It was a slider, just skids on and slaps Parthiv Patel's leg peg as he fails to connect with the slog sweep. Got too greedy and paid the price. Parthiv Patel b Tahir 19(14) [4s-4]",Tahir to Parthiv Patel,OUT
7898444,MI 1st Inns,6.3,"Tahir to Rohit, out Bowled!! And again, Imran Tahir is on fire. He's just unstoppable at the moment. A canny skidder this, just keeps going with the angle and clatters Rohit's stumps. He may have got a bit of inside edge there. He wasn't fully forward, neither backward. Poor feet movement. Rohit b Tahir 3(7)",Tahir to Rohit,OUT
7898444,MI 1st Inns,6.5,"Tahir to Buttler, out Lbw!! Inside-edge onto pad, but doesn't matter, the umpire has his finger up. No turn, just goes flat and on the stumps, Buttler is stuck inside the crease, tries to block off the front foot and ekes a big edge onto his pad. In real time though it appeared as if it had gone straight towards his pad. Wasn't to be. Big moment in the game? Buttler lbw b Tahir 38(19) [4s-3 6s-3]",Tahir to Buttler,OUT
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,10.1,"Southee to Rahane, out Caught by Nitish Rana!! A slight misjudgement from Rana in the deep but he's recovered really well here. The umpires want to have a second look. But I think the catch was clean enough. Soft signal is out, and we will stay with out. A back of a length delivery, Rahane slogs it across the line and hits it flat and straight towards deep square leg. Rana is slightly guilty of sleeping on it. He doesn't really move from his position, expecting it to carry comfortably, and has to dive forward in the end. Snatches it right off the turf. Southee has struck first ball of a new spell. MI needed that. Rahane c Nitish Rana b Southee 60(34) [4s-6 6s-3]",Southee to Rahane,OUT
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,15.2,"Hardik Pandya to Stokes, out Caught by Southee!! Another miscue, this time it goes straight to hand. Was it an off-cutter from Pandya? Might have been. It was there on a length though but Stokes doesn't get hold of it and holes out at deep mid-wicket. The crowd erupts with ""Dhoni, Dhoni"" chants. Stokes c Southee b Hardik Pandya 21(14) [4s-3]",Hardik Pandya to Stokes,OUT
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,3.1,"McClenaghan to Mayank Agarwal, out Caught by Rohit!! Soft dimissal for Mayank. A daft little shot - to be precise. This was a back of a length delivery outside off, the width was there to cut, instead, he attempted something of a forehand jab, doesn't keep it down and hits it straight into the hands of Rohit at mid-off. Not the start Mayank wanted in his new franchise. Mayank Agarwal c Rohit b McClenaghan 6(5) [4s-1]",McClenaghan to Mayank Agarwal,OUT
2373690,GL 1st Inns,10.2,"Kuldeep Yadav to Finch, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Second wicket for Kuldeep. One shot too many from Finch. It was the wrong 'un which was on a fuller length, Finch gives himself room to go inside out, the bat turns on impact and the ball skews towards long-off. Suryakumar runs around the circumference and pouches it cleanly. Finch c Suryakumar Yadav b Kuldeep Yadav 15(8) [6s-2]",Kuldeep Yadav to Finch,OUT
2373690,GL 1st Inns,19.5,"Boult to Karthik, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! A fine knock ends. He provided the much needed impetus to the innings. Deserved a fifty, but that's cricket. Short delivery that caught Karthik by a bit of surprise, pulled it towards long-on and Suryakumar takes the easiest of catches. Raina pats him on the back as he trudges off. Karthik c Suryakumar Yadav b Boult 47(25) [4s-6 6s-2]",Boult to Karthik,OUT
2373690,GL 1st Inns,3.1,"Chawla to Roy, out Caught by Y Pathan!! Roy falls and KKR have struck early. A nothing shot from the England opener. This was another long hop from Chawla, Roy rocked back on the pull, didn't go through with the shot completely - was perhaps just looking to help it on its way, gets a fat top-edge, high and over mid-wicket. Yusuf ran back and completed an easy catch. Roy looks gutted as he walks off. Roy c Y Pathan b Chawla 14(12) [4s-3]",Chawla to Roy,OUT
2373690,GL 1st Inns,8.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Brendon McCullum, out Lbw!! Kuldeep has his man. This was tossed up on the leg-stump line, McCullum was looking to turn it towards the on-side, the ball straightened and went past his inside edge, struck him low and in front of leg-stump, would have been crashing into the stumps. Easy call for the umpire and it's also time for the strategic break. Brendon McCullum lbw b Kuldeep Yadav 35(24) [4s-4 6s-2]",Kuldeep Yadav to Brendon McCullum,OUT
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,10.4,"Rahul Chahar to Amla, out Caught by Stokes!! The young man gets the big fish! A luring delivery tossed up outside off and the batsman looking to thwack it down the ground, finds the able hands of Stokes at long-off. That brings the game back in the balance. Amla was struggling to get the runs and pays the penalty trying to up the ante. Amla c Stokes b Rahul Chahar 28(27) [4s-2 6s-1]",Rahul Chahar to Amla,OUT
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,11.1,"Tahir to Axar, out Caught&Bowled!! Looks to go for the slog sweep, the googly undoes him and he manages a big fat top-edge. The high ball comes down for the bowler to pouch that. The trademark celebration from Tahir follows. That was a disastrous strike for KXIP as they had lost Amla a couple of balls earlier. The promotion didn't really yield the desired results. Axar c and b Tahir 24(22) [4s-1 6s-1]",Tahir to Axar,OUT
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,2.5,"Dinda to Vohra, out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! First wicket down! Dinda sees the batsman charge down and bangs it short. Vohra is cramped for room, but still persists with his pull shot. Doesn't middle it and the ball balloons up on the leg-side. Tiwary, who had a good stint with the bat, runs to his left from deep mid-wicket and gobbles it up. Vohra c Manoj Tiwary b Dinda 14(9) [4s-1 6s-1]",Dinda to Vohra,OUT
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,5.2,"Tahir to Saha, out Bowled!! Tahir strikes! And he is off! His customary celebratory run. He bamboozles Saha with a googly. It tweaked in at pace as well. Saha doesn't pick the wrong 'un and is also late to bring his bat down. The ball cannons onto the stumps. Through the gap between the bat and the pad. Saha b Tahir 14(9) [4s-3]",Tahir to Saha,OUT
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,0.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Mayank Agarwal, out Bowled!! Cleaned him up!! That was the ferocious inswinger and the batsman without covering the line of the ball looks to play across the line and misses. The sticks go cartwheeling and the bowler takes off with a hand in the air. He does it so often, does Sandeep Sharma. Superb bit of attacking bowling as he got the ball to land on the sticks and put the batsman on a tight leash. Mayank Agarwal b Sandeep Sharma 0(4)",Sandeep Sharma to Mayank Agarwal,OUT
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,11.2,"Swapnil Singh to Dhoni, out Caught&Bowled!! A tame dismissal. Quite typical of Dhoni's defences in the early part of his innings. One of those famed stabby defences, just that he cannot keep this one down. But Swapnil decides to help him to an extent, getting his palms and almost grassing it. A three-time juggle before he earns himself a story for a lifetime. The replays show it to be much slower, yeah Dhoni was made to check his defence causing the ball-lob. Dhoni c and b Swapnil Singh 5(11)",Swapnil Singh to Dhoni,OUT
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,17.3,"Axar to Stokes, out Caught&Bowled!! A smash back. And the perish. Patel smartly keeps denying Stokes the opportunity to go through the on-side by firing it wide outside off. Gets the bat up flat on the slap down the ground. Too early once again and all he manages is the cue end that flies back to the upward palms of Patel. So the change in bats not quite what the side wanted at this point. Stokes c and b Axar 50(32) [4s-2 6s-3]",Axar to Stokes,OUT
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,19.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Christian, out Caught by Maxwell!! Shovels it to his doom. Only after having done his job to perfection. Sandeep gets the yorker right and Christian gets his bat down off a massive backlift in shovelling it out. Not quite the elevation this time with the ball flying down to long-on. Christian c Maxwell b Sandeep Sharma 17(8) [4s-2 6s-1]",Sandeep Sharma to Christian,OUT
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,6.2,"T Natarajan to Rahane, out Caught by Stoinis!! There you go! The young man strikes. Whatta moment for him. A length delivery slanting away, Rahane looks to drive on the up, hits it uppishly and finds the safe hands of Stoinis in the sweeper region on the off-side. The fielder was looking into the sun, so he steadied himself, got a hand up to create a better vision and then gobbled it up. Rahane c Stoinis b T Natarajan 19(15) [4s-1 6s-1]",T Natarajan to Rahane,OUT
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,8.1,"Stoinis to Smith, out Caught by Vohra!! HUGEEEEE WICKKKETTTT for KXIP. That was a leading edge as the ball held onto the surface for the batsman to not control the whippy pull. The man in the deep - Vohra, this time settles down and takes a smart catch at the edge of the boundary. It almost carried all the way. Pune in trouble now. Smith c Vohra b Stoinis 26(27) [4s-3]",Stoinis to Smith,OUT
7088566,DC 1st Inns,10.5,"Stanlake to Samson, out Caught by Binny!! Stanlake rushes Samson and gets rid of him. Really tame dismissal actually. He's pulling on the front foot, the ball is onto him quicker than expected and it hits him right on the splice. It spoons up for an easy catch to long-on. Bangalore keep hitting back, they keep fighting. Samson c Binny b Stanlake 13(12) [4s-1]",Stanlake to Samson,OUT
7088566,DC 1st Inns,13.0,"I Abdulla to Chris Morris, out Lbw!! The ball slides on with the arm, clips both the pads and up goes the finger. Morris was caught in the crease there to a flat ball from round the wicket, and then he made the mistake of playing across the line. That would have hit leg-stump. So Bangalore have struck back as soon as Delhi threatened to surge ahead. It's been that kind of chase. Chris Morris lbw b I Abdulla 4(5)",I Abdulla to Chris Morris,OUT
7088566,DC 1st Inns,14.5,"Chahal to Brathwaite, out Bowled!! Chahal's got him the very next ball and he is absolutely pumped. This is serious drama in Bangalore. A beautifully flighted leg-break which drifts in on leg, the ball dips on Brathwaite, lands away from him as he slogs and sneaks under him. Brathwaite b Chahal 1(5)",Chahal to Brathwaite,OUT
7088566,DC 1st Inns,16.2,"Watson to Pat Cummins, out Bowled!! It swings one way, and then the other. Watson hits back with a vengeance. A good length delivery which is in the slot for the slog, but the ball nips in just a touch to cause the error from Cummins. He chops it back on off an inside edge. The crowd is right in this. Pat Cummins b Watson 6(6) [4s-1]",Watson to Pat Cummins,OUT
7088566,DC 1st Inns,19.1,"Negi to Pant, out Bowled!! Negi has done it. That is surely the game for the RCB. Pant moves across towards off, Negi may or may not have seen that but he fires it on leg-stump and uproots it. A real valiant effort from Pant comes to an end. He's dragging himself off. Got to feel for him. Pant b Negi 57(36) [4s-3 6s-4]",Negi to Pant,OUT
7088566,DC 1st Inns,19.3,"Negi to Nadeem, out Caught&Bowled!! Negi tosses this up and lands it far enough from Nadeem to make him reach out for the slog. The ball turns, takes a thick leading edge and lobs up. Negi doesn't leave it for anyone else, he runs backwards and grabs it so well. Made it look easy there. Nadeem c and b Negi 0(2)",Negi to Nadeem,OUT
7088566,DC 1st Inns,4.4,"Tymal Mills to Tare, out Bowled!! Mills has struck. A fierce short of length delivery which skids on, keeps a bit low and nips back in from round the wicket. Tare makes room once more and has a slash at it but he's played over the ball by six inches at least. It pummels the off-stump. Tare b Tymal Mills 18(17) [4s-3]",Tymal Mills to Tare,OUT
7088566,DC 1st Inns,5.3,"Stanlake to Nair, out Bowled!! It's game on here at the Chinnaswamy! Nair has played completely down the wrong line of a full ball and is castled comprehensively. The crowd erupts. Rusty footwork from Nair as he presses forward to drive, the ball didn't seem to do a great deal. Might have held its line a touch if anything. Nair played way inside the line of it, maybe anticipating it to come back. The off and middle stumps are clobbered. Nair b Stanlake 4(3) [4s-1]",Stanlake to Nair,OUT
7088566,DC 1st Inns,7.3,"I Abdulla to Billings, out Caught by Stanlake!! Billings has been completely outsmarted. What clever bowling from Abdulla. He enticingly tosses this on up and ensures to keep it very wide of off. Seeing the flight, Billings is lured into having a go at it but he's not quite to the pitch of the ball and has to reach out for it. The ball turns away further, lobs up off a thick edge and is taken by Stanlake at backward point. Bangalore are making good inroads. Billings c Stanlake b I Abdulla 25(19) [4s-1 6s-1]",I Abdulla to Billings,OUT
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,15.0,"Zaheer to Binny, out Caught by Billings!! Lovely shot - but Binny has found deep mid-wicket to perfection. This was full and on his pads, Binny gets forward and whips it beautifully - but unfortunately for him, the placement wasn't right. Straight into the hands of Billings and he doesn't drop those. A small contribution from Binny - but a big wicket under the circumstances for the Daredevils. Binny c Billings b Zaheer 16(18) [4s-1]",Zaheer to Binny,OUT
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,16.4,"Zaheer to Vishnu Vinod, out Vishnu Vinod Run Out!! That was completely unnecessary from Vishnu Vinod and it has cost him his wicket. This was a floaty delivery outside off, Vinod got underneath it and drilled it towards extra-cover. Almost a catch to Nadeem, he doesn't go for it though, instead, stops it on the half-volley, the return to the bowler is good and Zaheer whips the bails off - with Vishnu Vinod miles out of the crease. Vishnu Vinod run out (Nadeem/Zaheer) 9(5) [6s-1]",Zaheer to Vishnu Vinod,OUT
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,17.0,"Zaheer to Kedar Jadhav, out Caught by Chris Morris!! That's another huge wicket and RCB are losing their way towards the end. Lovely piece of deception from Zaheer. He followed the slower short ball with another slower ball, rolled his fingers across the seam. Kedar was backing away on the lofted drive, gets it right off the bottom of the bat, plenty of height but not the distance. Morris settles under it and holds on at mid-off. Kedar Jadhav c Chris Morris b Zaheer 69(37) [4s-5 6s-5]",Zaheer to Kedar Jadhav,OUT
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,19.3,"Chris Morris to Negi, out Bowled!! Morris gets his yorker right and Negi's stumps go for a walk. This was fast, this was full and this was on the middle-stump line. Negi backs away on the drive, misses and simply walks back to the pavilion. Negi b Chris Morris 10(8) [6s-1]",Chris Morris to Negi,OUT
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,20.0,"Chris Morris to Tymal Mills, out Bowled!! Morris gets another wicket with a juicy full-toss. RCB finish with just 157 on the board. Mills made room on the drive, missed and the off-stump goes for a walk. Tymal Mills b Chris Morris 0(3)",Chris Morris to Tymal Mills,OUT
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,3.2,"Chris Morris to Gayle, out Caught by Samson!! A high full-toss has got rid of the big Jamaican. Gayle looked surprised, was looking to blast it over the top, can't get on top of the ball, it hit him high on the bat and lobbed over Samson at mid-off. He ran back, kept his eyes on the ball even as it landed beyond his shoulder, dives and clutches it with both hands. Chinnaswamy has been stunned into silence as the big man departs. Gayle c Samson b Chris Morris 6(8) [4s-1]",Chris Morris to Gayle,OUT
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,5.5,"Pat Cummins to Mandeep, out Bowled!! Mandeep has chopped on for the second straight time in this tournament. On a length and just outside off, Mandeep saw the width, manufactured a bit more by backing away slightly, went with hard hands on the cut, gets an inside edge that bounces back onto the middle-stump. He was looking very good, but it means nothing now. Another promising start, but nothing more for Mandeep. Mandeep b Pat Cummins 12(10) [4s-3]",Pat Cummins to Mandeep,OUT
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,8.4,"Nadeem to Watson, out Stumped!! Nadeem has deceived Watson completely in the air. Anticipated that Watson was getting itchy and was looking to dominate him, shortened his length and beats Watson in the air, the extra bounce did the trick. Watson was completely flummoxed on the lofted drive and Pant is quick to whip the bails off. RCB are in a spot of bother now. Watson st Pant b Nadeem 24(24) [4s-4]",Nadeem to Watson,OUT
7200146,GL 1st Inns,16.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Dwayne Smith, out Caught by (sub)Vijay Shankar!! Kumar strikes! Half the GL side are back in the hut now. Smith runs out of patience, decides to take on Bhuvi. It was a slower delivery and the West Indian didn't pick it. Was early into the shot and went through it, skews it off the toe-end and slices it towards deep mid-wicket. Vijay Shankar, the sub, runs to his left and pouched it safely.

Was that going over the top? Should the benefit of doubt been given to Kedar? This was the nip-backer from Aaron, Kedar was on the hop, impact was just around the off stump and hawk-eye shows the ball missing the stumps. Another poor call from the umpire.

It's always dangerous to shimmy down the wicket for a bowler like Tahir, who generally skids the ball through, and that is what happened. Billings came down the wicket and Tahir pushed it through, by the time the Kent batsman could get his bat down, the ball was past him and crashed into off-stump.

It was on a fuller length around off, it was the off-cutter from Zak. Rahane perhaps went hard at it, the ball seemed to have stopped on the pitch and that must've foiled Rahane's attempt there.

Warner tries for another switch hit and this time it doesn't come off, ends up playing it off the back of the bat as the ball slid onto him and then the heroics of PP.

This was tossed up on the leg-stump line, Uthappa went a long way across his stumps, bent down and was looking to lap it past the keeper, misses and the ball hits the top of leg-stump.

Two wickets in two overs and the pendulum swings back in favour of KKR now. It was a pacy back of a length delivery, Maxwell backed away towards the leg-side, perhaps was undone by the bounce there. He is tucked up for room, ends up having a slash at it. Gets a feather and Uthappa makes no mistake behind the stumps. First time Maxi has been dismissed in this IPL.

Slips in a friendly full toss on the stumps, Miller went for a whack across the line, again squirts it high on the bat. Pops it high towards deep mid-wicket. Pandey ran forward, covered good ground and snaffled a good running catch. The umpires checked for a possible no-ball (both crease and height), but it was fine. KKR anthem blares in the background.

Not a big turner of the ball, this bloke, and that skiddiness through the surface accounts for Vohra. May have been the googly. Pushed through the air, lands it on a length, and the ball zips through the gate as Vohra tries to loft it on the up. He was aiming for the inside-out shot with the turn.

Binny was being under used in the last three matches. Makes amends immediately today with a prized scalp of Buttler.

Hits the deck on a shortish length outside off, Gayle wanted to pull it, he had to fetch it from outside off. He came down a step and wanted to smack the leather off it. All he could do was manifest a faint nick to the keeper. PP went up straightaway and Hardik joined him late. Hushed silence in the crowd.

Even he can't believe that he has plucked that out. A blob for Rahane and early trouble for Pune. This one jagged back in from a shortish length, Rahane thought it would be shaping away and went for a flashy cut, the outside edge flies towards the cordon.

Should have tried to bat a bit longer, especially with Smith at the other end. Full delivery on off, Tripathi makes a bit of room and lofts it to mid-off. The idea was to go over the fielder, but with the ball being too close to his bat, he did not get the elevation. Finch reverse cups it right on the edge of the circle.

Short of length delivery just outside off, Smith went for the pull and top edged it towards long-off. Finch had plenty of time to settle under that and he pouches it safely.

Morris blasted a 9-ball 38 in the previous game against RPS, coming in at this stage. Short of a length delivery and Morris pulls, he does not bother to keep it down, was planning to clear the fielder. But since it was off the bottom of the bat, it has no wings to fly over Mohit at deep square. Chris Morris c Mohit Sharma b Sandeep Sharma 16(8) [4s-1 6s-1]",Sandeep Sharma to Chris Morris,OUT

8351592,DC 1st Inns,7.3,"Aaron to Nair, out Caught by Saha!! That's an excellent catch from Saha. Credit to Varun, kept persisting it with short pitch stuff and it pays off. After conceding 13 runs in his first over, he shows great courage and picks up a wicket. It was short and drifting down leg, Nair, in a bid to tickle it fine, gloves it to the left of Saha. He flings and settles under it. Nair c Saha b Aaron 0(3)",Aaron to Nair,OUT
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,1.4,"Nadeem to Vohra, out Lbw!! Shahbaz Nadeem strikes in his very first over. He's having a wonderful season. The umpire took his time before raising the dreaded finger. Did that pitch in line? Yes, it did and spun away. Vohra gets down on one knee and in his attempt to lap it fine, misses it completely. He is pinged on the thigh pad in front of middle and leg. HawkEye confirms that would have hit the leg-pole. Good decision from the umpire. Vohra lbw b Nadeem 3(6)",Nadeem to Vohra,OUT
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,10.0,"Pat Cummins to Eoin Morgan, out Caught by Nair!! He's cut that straight to backward point this time. That's a big blow.

8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,10.3,"Mishra to Maxwell, out Caught by Billings!! Is that the game for DD? The in-form Maxwell is gone for a duck. Too much pressure really. He had to tee off from the word go with the required rate touching 13, and Mishra isn't the most straightforward bloke to take on first up. He cleverly bowls it a little wide of off forcing Maxwell to reach out for his slog-sweep and it comes right off the bottom. It's a top-edge too. Simple catch for Billings at deep mid-wicket. Maxwell c Billings b Mishra 0(2)",Mishra to Maxwell,OUT
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,13.4,"Corey Anderson to Miller, out Lbw!! Miller's painful stay at the crease has ended through a full toss. Anderson gets some tail on the delivery and swirls it in on middle, and Miller plays all around it. His head fell over too. The ball crashes into the back leg on the full. Just one of those days for Miller. Never found any timing whatsoever. Miller lbw b Corey Anderson 24(28) [4s-1]",Corey Anderson to Miller,OUT
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,18.5,"Pat Cummins to Mohit Sharma, out Bowled!! Off the pads and into leg-stump. Cummins followed Mohit with a full ball as he backed away a touch.

8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,3.2,"Nadeem to Saha, out Caught by Zaheer!! Zaheer takes a catch and claims it. The umpires decide to go up and the soft signal is out. It was darted in on off, Saha danced down, moved leg-side and went for the inside-out shot. Couldn't get enough elevation on that and finds Zak at extra cover. The ball was dipping when it approached him, but Zaheer had both his hands underneath the ball. Second wicket for Shahbaz Nadeem. Now, it's all down to the four foreign recruits for KXIP to make a match out of this. Saha c Zaheer b Nadeem 7(5) [4s-1]",Nadeem to Saha,OUT
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,4.4,"Chris Morris to Amla, out Caught by Billings!! Would you believe that? Amla perishes to a full toss. There was one fielder in the deep on the leg-side and Amla finds him perfectly. A low full toss on the pads, Amla with a slight shuffle, flicks it in the air and hits it straight down the throat of Billings at long leg. Punjab in a spot of bother.

7374716,GL 1st Inns,11.1,"Harbhajan to Raina, out Caught by Rohit!! This was on the cards. Raina kept charging down to the spinners without much success, but he didn't stop trying. Shimmies down and Harbhajan being a clever bowler, tosses it up well outside off, Raina has to reach out for the inside out loft, all he could manage was a slice towards cover-point.

A fine knock from McCullum comes to an end. Battled hard and has built a platform for his lower-order.

Kishan has been asked to wait by Ravi. The front leg is fine. Legal delivery that and Ravi raises his finger. The back of the hand slower ball dug in short, Kishan takes it on and top edges it to deep square leg. Krunal misjudged it for a second, but recovered well to pouch it.

Good seam presentation on this good length delivery. It pitches on middle and jags away off the track. Parthiv gets a leading edge looking to work it through the on-side and finds point.

Another start and another stutter for Buttler. His rope is coming to an end, especially with Simmons waiting in the wings. Short of a length delivery, Buttler pulls and gets it high on the bat, straight down McCullum's throat at long-on. Replays show that it was a slower ball - the leg-cutter and Buttler had to manufacture all the pace, which he couldn't.

Pollard had to take the risk and he perishes while doing so. Full and slow, on middle and leg, since there was no pace, Pollard could not gather momentum on the flick, skies it towards deep mid-wicket, Jadeja won't drop those.

He tosses this on off, gets it to dip on AB to draw him out of the crease and then turns it right across him for the stumping. This is a brilliant piece of leg-spin bowling. AB was ambitiously trying to flick this through mid-wicket but he's beaten in flight and length. Dhoni, quick as ever, hardly takes any time to whip those bails off. That's lightning glovework.

9515142,RCB 1st Inns,5.3,"Stokes to Kohli, out Caught by Rahane!! Stokes has Kohli. That's a really sharp short ball. Kohli was on the move down the pitch, Stokes bangs it in and gets it around head high. Kohli still doesn't back down. He has a big swish at it and probably caught it right off the bottom of the bat. It slices up in the air for a simple catch to Rahane at sweeper cover. Another wicket, especially of AB, and things will get really interesting.

9515142,RPS 1st Inns,16.5,"Aravind to Christian, out Caught by Mandeep!! They are falling apart. Three wickets in the span of six balls. All the momentum that seemed to have drifted Pune's way has surely been redirected via the national highway to Bangalore. A fullish delivery this and full-paced as well for a change. Christian executes the clip but fails to keep it down. Doesn't get it high enough either. The middle path treaded takes the lob into the safe palms of deep square leg.

A length delivery assumed to be in the slot for the slog here from Stokes. He lines up neatly and does everything right in swinging his ba putting all forearms to good use. Just that there is hardly any bounce here to sit up for the timing to come out right. Scoots under the flat bat and sends the off-pole on a cartwheel. Stokes b Milne 2(3)",Milne to Stokes,OUT

Squeezes out a fullish one, almost whipping it in the process to long-on. A charge in and a good throw at the keeper's end ensures that Tiwary's desperate diving attempt to get back in for the second is futile. So, 161 is what Pune manage.

The Kiwi charged in from the rope and fired a flat throw right next to the stumps to Uthappa, who did the rest. Even a dive from Iyer was not enough to save him.

Hence, instead of sitting up for Maxwell's heave over mid-on, the ball slices up in the air towards long-off where Warner has no problems in gobbling it up. The skipper's pumped.

Really poor shot selection. Miller b Rashid Khan 1(6)",Rashid Khan to Miller,OUT

The peppery bouncer comes out right, half way down the pitch and gaining in altitude even on this sluggish track. Dhawan meanwhile looks to take it on with his swivelling turn in hooking it away.

Patel floats it up generously and Henriques looks to unsettle the new man with a charge down and an aimless slog. Misses the line completely and is undone by the sharp turn on offer as well.

Had bowled a similar full ball earlier in the over to McCullum, but the batsman had resisted then. Not this time. It's McCullum. Gujarat need 77 off 33, so he takes this on. Tries the slog-sweep, fails to get under the ball and offers a steepler to deep mid-wicket. Milne there, who catches it, doing a much better job than he did with the ball earlier.

Ishan runs back for the second, Jadeja was unsure about it. Intended. Then not. Then again. But hey, Ishan is at your end. You better get back in. But he's ball-watching and Ishan edge-crosses him at the bowler's end, getting past the marker line quicker. Keeper Kedar Jadhav takes the bails off.

Slows it up, gives it a lot of air and invites Finch to take it on. Finch in his tentative reach outs looks to search for a feel of the turn. Only for the ball to drift away, bounce and go away past the outside edge for the keeper to do his bit. Yep, the back leg is way out.

But that's how he's been playing so far. Yuvraj does well to get it slightly wide of off and Pant has to reach out for the slog-sweep.

Fourth wicket down and things look bleak for DD. They need something special to get out of this. Good length delivery with a bit of inward movement, Anderson is caught in the crease, beaten on the inside edge and the ball hits the back pad right in front of middle.

Back of a length delivery angled across off, Pant hangs his bat away from the body, the ball takes a healthy edge and flies to the lone slipper, Harbhajan clings on comfortably.

Nair becomes the sixth batsmen to record a single-digit score. This is getting embarrassing for DD.

But, the umpire isn't fooled by any of his tactics. Pings his index finger straight up acknowleding the appeal from the keeper. It twirls away from a good length and massages the edge en route to Rishabh Pant. Krunal Pandya c Pant b Mishra 17(16) [4s-1]",Mishra to Krunal Pandya,OUT

Clever cricket from Cummins though, rolled his fingers across the ball at the last instant, Pollard had made room to go for a big heave-ho, went through even though there was no pace on the ball. The ball went high up and the cool, calm Samson was under it at long-on. Taken comfortably. Pollard c Samson b Pat Cummins 26(29) [4s-4]",Pat Cummins to Pollard,OUT

Rabada does not offer any width to Pandya, spears it in the blockhole, an inside edge hits the pad and drops on the pitch. Harbhajan calls for the run and he forgets to slide the ball.

Rana, with the kind of form he is in, looks to tonk it over deep square with a pull. He might have timed that well, but with 140ks thudding your bat, you can't clear the fence every day.

Karthik who takes a decent catch behind the stumps now becomes the first wicket-keeper in the IPL to register 100 dismissals. Here's what happened on this ball: just short of a good length that came in and might have left a bit off the deck to compel Vohra to have a feel for it.

I guess it should be renamed to wicket-taking-break. Second time today that GL have got a wicket after the time-out. Flatter and on the stumps, Amla makes room and slaps it straight back, it was traveling quickly and Agarwal did well to bend down and pouch that. Made it look easy did the youngster.

This looked like a certain six, but the timing wasn't spot on, Chahal - at deep square leg, watches it all along and makes sure that he didn't step onto the ropes. A big wicket for RCB. Nicely bowled by Binny as well, shortened the length, rolled his fingers across the seam and made Narine manufacture all the power. He did so, but was just short enough to clear the ropes.

Good length ball around off, Dhoni goes for the pull and the ball does not bounce as much as he anticipated, the inside edge crashes into the stumps. Dhoni b Bumrah 7(11)",Bumrah to Dhoni,OUT

One of Dhoni and the other of the in-form Tiwary. The wrong 'un keeps bamboozling the batsmen, Tiwary like others does not pick, lunges forward to work it into the leg-side, missed and beaten comprehensively.

This was tossed up on the off-stump line, Karun went down on his knees as he looked to play the slog sweep, missed it completely and was struck on the back thigh-pad. Was the impact outside off? Need to have a look at the replays, but it was certainly hitting the stumps, the umpire doesn't think a lot, up goes the dreaded finger.

That made Kohli set-off for a quick single before being sent back. The throw is at the bowler and he doesn't make a clean stop.

That was at best a mortal throw from the deep mid-wicket fielder and Dhoni has transfigured it into a wicket-taking one. You have to see it to believe it. Turned towards deep square leg by Raina, Rahane sprinted across and let out a flat throw to his credit, severely threatening the second run there. And then Dhoni takes over. Waited behind the stumps, keeping his hands near the bails and just dislodges them off, like he hates them. Like he loves the red light. Raina is gone.

Dhoni waits, and then some, and hits but couldn't impart the power that he should have. Straight to McCullum at long-off. Pune might be done here.. but hey, Stokes here.

Finch has some distance to cover and Tripathi senses the second run. Withdraws late and digs his grave as Finch hits the target at the bowler's end. Stokes looked angry there. No fault of his though.

That's like committing without knowing what is in store. Cannot retreat, it is late for him. Tries to ramp but there is no pace or the bounce to ease things for him. Ends up guiding it into the hands of Siraj at short third man. This is far from over. Delhi have not chased well and because they have not, they will need some extra effort to go past the line here.

The SRH captain didn't look comfortable at all and DD will be delighted with that wicket.

Guptill wanted to go over mid-off, but lack of pace on the ball meant the bat turned in his hands on impact with the ball. Ended up slicing it and it's a simple grab for Negi.

Didn't use his feet to a fullish ball, so he shimmies out this time to compensate. The length's been nicely shortened by Sharma, and also gets it to move away. The result: Gayle is down the track and slices an outside edge to gully -- yes, there was one, for Gayle. Comeback done and dusted. Gayle c Guptill b Sandeep Sharma 0(2)",Sandeep Sharma to Gayle,OUT
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,10.5,"Axar to Watson, out Caught by Saha!! This is the fifth time Axar Patel has dismissed Watto in IPL, the most he has dismissed any batsman. Just wow! A quicker flatter dart outside off, from Jaddu's book you would think. Watson goes deep inside the crease to flay it square, feeds the faintest of nicks to the keeper.

One guy has ran out of expressions, he just tweaks his hair while giving THAT WHAT.THE.____ expression! Oh boy! Things going bad to worse for RCB. No real turn, just stump-to-stump channel and fired it flat, Mandeep rocks back to pull, a big swish across the line. Misses by a long way and the middle pole takes the pasting.

Natarajan aborted himself at the last second and evaded the dash, but Aaron and Saha didn't. In the end, Saha accepts while gliding into Varun Aaron who was running from backward point.

Sees Kohli shimmy out and still keeps it straight at the stumps. Kohli overruns, letting the ball sneak through and timbah. The trick was that Sharma stuck to a normal pace delivery. Kohli would have connected had it been a slower one. Wasn't and bam, Kohli is gone. Kohli b Sandeep Sharma 6(6) [4s-1]",Sandeep Sharma to Kohli,OUT

Now that's something to roast others about, in your white picket-fenced villa that you buy from your IPL contract. So, coming back to reality, AB was shimmying out of his crease, high on confidence of bullying the last ball for a six. What Sandeep does is to keep it full but just about adjusts the line to something further outside off. AB gets an edge on the charge and the keeper does so well to anticipate it all and move to his right to pouch that.

Clocks 134ks but gets the ball to hold in the pitch, as Kedar charges out in ambition. Tries to check his shot but ends up slicing it off the splice to short cover. Kedar wanted to go leg-side, and go big, but was hoaxed by the ball never arriving at all. Where are we headed? More importantly, where are RCB?

Nothing wrong with that. Just that he wants the single desperately after that - something Rahane declines making him return from his adventures half way down the track. A direct hit and you do not need to disturb the third umpire for these. Had given up. Oh what a waste of form. Tripathi run out (Bipul Sharma) 1(4)",Nehra to Tripathi,OUT

He dropped Smith earlier off the same bowler but washes off all the sins now. A very full ball outside off, Smith tried to be smart, opened the bat face and looked to flay it in the pocket between point and short third man. But fails in his endeavour.

A fuller length delivery on the stumps, Tiwary pushes it towards long-off and set off for the second. Dhoni showed signs of interest but on seeing the fielder rush onto the ball, he sent back Tiwary and sold him down the river. The Bengal batsman had no chance of returning back once he took off.

Gets it in the form of an uncontrolled sweep. Rahane doesn't really reach out, takes one hand off the handle as well as he top-edges it to a running in Yuvi from the square leg fence.

Nothing special about this delivery. Short and outside off, Warner was on the hop trying to play the cut, does not bother to keep it down and picks out the sweeper to perfection.

Short ball, Shreyas Iyer is clearly done in by the pace. Is late on the pull, the ball hits the splice and skies. Second one down for Delhi. They are not helping their cause.

The key to this dismissal was once again Nabi opting to bowl a flatter trajectory, knowing that the batsman was targetting the on-side boundary. Simmons was nowhere close to this ball, a wild swing it was, ended up playing outside the line and made a mess of the stumps. Simmons b Nabi 1(5)",Nabi to Simmons,OUT

He gets an inside edge and it also came off the bottom portion of the bat. Hits his boot and cannons onto the stumps. He could have gone with a stroke through the off-side.

He wanted to take the attack to the new bowler, in the process, he has played a false shot. This was a short of a length delivery outside off stump, it was never there to be pulled away, had to fetch it, an off-side shot would have been ideal, in the end slices it high in the air - the bat turned in his hands on impact - and only goes as far as mid-off.

He's taken an excellent catch and Mumbai aren't getting a hang of things here. Kaul gets his second wicket, it was the slower delivery, looked like the knuckle ball, Parthiv flicked uppishly, was beaten by the change of pace, hence couldn't control the shot, the ball wasn't comfortably carrying to the fielder.

This is a big, big wicket and a wicket that Mumbai needed badly. Warner was on the back foot expecting some short stuff, wasn't to be. McClenaghan spears in a full one that keeps tailing in to hit Warner on the back pad. Dead in front. Warner was looking to play straight...oh wait!

The Bumrah slower one on this sticky wicket finally consumes a wicket for Mumbai - too late in the day one would reckon. After a few checked defences, Henriques looks to pile on the angle coming in off a fullish length as he turns his bat looking to flick it away.

Guess he had read the slower ball, for he was waiting with his stance open but the length was such that he couldn't get right under it. So ends up scooping it high in the air.

Lynn had the room made, swats at a back of a length delivery and hacks it to deep mid-wicket. And then coaxes de Grandhomme into a second. Is running back to the danger end. Axar darts a throw back to Saha; he's having that kinda day. He's having a field. On the bounce to Saha, who takes the bails off and Lynn is just short. Wow. Just the wicket KXIP needed.

For a moment he seemed to be safe, but there was that man. MS ran backwards, kept his eyes on the ball, timed his leap well and completed a one-handed catch - with his right glove.

Excellent work from MS, quick hands did the trick, but that was very well bowled by Sundar as well. He slowed down the pace, dragged Anderson forward on the drive and did him in with the turn.

This was banged in short and on his body, Tewatia was late on the pull, the ball ballooned off the top-edge and lobbed behind the keeper.

Short and on the stumps, Rohit went back, lost balance while playing the pull shot, didn't middle it, Thakur jumped at deep mid-wicket and took the catch.

A fullish one outside off, push-driven to mid-off where the cat-like Williamson runs in and scores a direct-hit at the non-striker's end. Short nods at Rahane, but not in a reassuring way. Nope, the other thing. Death knell for D'Arcy. And that's Williamson for you, after a few blinders in whites a few weeks ago. The aggression comes from within.

Exceptional bowling from Kaul, banged in short and at Gowtham, he had nowhere to go as he fended rather awkwardly. The ball ballooned off his gloves, popped straight up and it's an easy catch for Saha. The umpire wants to check for the front-foot no-ball, but Kaul is just about fine on that count.

The delivery was short alright and Raina picked the length early, but his feet could not make the adjustment to rock back and the pull was off the top-edge, Vinay ran across to his left from long-on and completed a straightforward catch.

Dhoni waits as the umpire checks for a front foot no-ball, Chawla is fine and Dhoni continues walking. Clever bowling from Chawla, slowed it up a touch and kept it outside off, Dhoni was down on his knee to play the sweep, through the shot early and the under edge is found.

So he gets a fuller-slower one now, he's camping on his back foot, goes to smoke it straight over. Doesn't time, gets it off the bottom half, flies high. And down mid-on's backtracking reverse cup.

Short does the needful, gets deep in the crease, lines up and throws his bat out in looking to cut it away. There's a hint of spit up, enough to grope a fat chunk on the top-edge.

CSK's best batsman on show thus far has been sent back. Massive setback. Rayudu drove this full ball straight to Ashwin at extra-cover and set off, Dhoni said no straightaway - probably because of the niggle on the lower back. But Rayudu had already covered a lot of distance and Ashwin's throw was spot on. Rayudu run out (Ashwin) 49(35) [4s-5 6s-1]",Barinder to Rayudu,OUT

Normal seam-up delivery, full again for a big hit, Jadeja wanted to go over long-off, sliced it high in the air and the KXIP makes no mistake. Important thing is Dhoni has crossed over and will be on strike now. Jadeja c Ashwin b Andrew Tye 19(13) [4s-1 6s-1]",Andrew Tye to Jadeja,OUT
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,2.0,"Mohit Sharma to Watson, out Caught by Barinder!! Too cute, and that's never ideal. Mohit gets his line wrong, slipping into the legs, but he's neatly disguised this slower back-hander. Watson's fooled as he loads up and commits to swipe it, knowing there's nobody at fine leg. Goes through early, gets a fat splice and short fine pockets the balloon. Watson c Barinder b Mohit Sharma 11(9) [4s-2]",Mohit Sharma to Watson,OUT

So it was the knuckle ball, Tye's staple, Vijay gets down the track in trying to dispatch it into long-off. Loses shape, loses timing, and Sran's there at mid-off, waiting to gobble up the skier.

We're upstairs. It started with Billings shuffling, exposing his stumps and sweeping. Ashwin smartly slips in the quicker one, bang in line with the stumps. UltraEdge shows no edge.

Three reds and he is outta here. Here's the comeback from CSK. It was the quick googly from Tahir and Finch definitely didn't pick that. Presses forward to block and got rapped on the front leg in front of off. That's plumb. Tahir is pumped. Runs with the arms aloft and slaps the CSK symbol with on his shirt.

For a moment he has forgotten about the damage done. That was a poor delivery but Rahul got carried away and lifted the ball aerially for the man at cover, who was on the edge of the circle, to take it. CSK have a small ray of hope.

The old-fashioned yorker - still gets you wickets even today. Will do so after 100 years as well. Just that you have to get it right. Boult did, slipped it under A Russell's swinging bat and it clipped middle and leg. Superb bowling and that wicket could mean a difference of 20 at least to the eventual score.

Slower ball from Kaul and it was a bit short, Agarwal was in two minds whether to go hard at it or just use his touch. In the end, all he managed was to spoon it straight to Hooda at backward point.

Took a step down the track and whipped that with lots of bottom hand power, failed to keep it down and found CSK's best fielder Jadeja at mid-on. He judges it beautifully and slides to take it with two hands. If there was one fielder, Kohli didn't want the ball to go to, then it must have been Jadeja.

This (the final wicket) was coming; Basil Thampi gets his line right and attacks the stumps with a full one, it was pacy and too hot to handle for Ankit Rajpoot, he went across his stumps to try the funky scoop over short fine and missed.

Banged in short and curving away from the left-hander, Dhawan didn't cover for the angle as he fended at that, doesn't get on top of the bounce and gets a thick outside edge.

This was the quicker one from Chawla and it skidded through low, Shaw didn't expect it to keep that low and his wild pull across the line didn't help his cause either. Misses it completely and the woodwork is disturbed. Nevertheless, a top quality innings from the young man. He's made a statement here in the IPL.

We have seen Indian batsmen get out to the bouncer but trust me, this has to be one of weirdest ways of getting out. Lovely bouncer and Pant was stuck on the crease, probably beaten for both pace and bounce. Fails to drop his wrists in time and it flies high off the glove. It's a dolly for the KKR skipper and suddenly, the visitors are right back in this with the twin strikes. The in-form Pant has to go. He has a wry smile on his face as he walks back.

The bat turned in his hands at the point of impact, he ended up slicing it high and towards long-off. de Grandhomme completes a fine catch. He had to make sure that he didn't step onto the ropes as he completed the catch - which he did. Relief for RCB and Chinnaswamy finds its voice back.

Fuller ball and a bit wide outside off, he tried to go over the man at long-off but didn't middle this at all. Easiest of catches for Boult near the ropes.

Drifts this in just around off, straightens a tad off the deck as Raina went for a wild hoick across the line. Bizarre shot to play very early in the innings but he probably thought that the surface is good to start blasting straight away. Got burnt eventually. Just the kind of momentum DD were looking for.

Is hurried by the pace and ends up slicing it towards mid-on. Jaddu, the best fielder in the CSK set-up leaps across, times his jump to perfection and pouches the dolly at mid-off.

Second wicket for Asif, nips out both openers. Looked like it was a certain trap, plotted by MSD and Asif. Much like the last ball, ushered it short and this was closer to the body. Munro swung across, only height as it went a long way into the night sky. There was a fielder waiting at deep mid-wicket and he set himself under it to gobble it up. Safe hands from Karn Sharma.

Push-driven towards extra cover, there was never a single there. Iyer kept running, Pant took a couple of strides down the pitch before he stopped.

Dropped in front of point, they set off for a single. Yuvi's bat got stuck in the turf and a flat, neat throw from Lewis to the keeper. Kishan does the rest.

Fullish on off, Nair backed away aiming to go inside-out over extra cover. Doesn't get the timing right and ends up hitting it towards Harik at long-off, who had to run to his left and gobbles it up.

This was the attempted wrong 'un by Markande, dropped it way too short though, might have stuck slightly on the pitch, Rahul had to wait that extra second as he pulled, enough to mess up with his timing and he struck it hard, flat and straight to Duminy at deep mid-wicket.

Have to say that this was a result of the slow scoring by Lewis and Kishan at the other end. Slower ball and the length is dragged back as well, Suryakumar went for the slog but only managed to sky it high in the air. Rahul was quick to call for it and trekked back nicely to sit under it.

Saw Kishan give the charge and hung it back a bit in the air. Pulled the length back just a touch and that meant that the wild slog was never really on. Kishan misses and finds the stumps in a mess.

Loves bowling at the back end of the innings. This is a big strike for KXIP as the dangerous Hardik Pandya has to depart. He did get going tonight from the word go but his cameo has been nipped in the bud.

But to be honest, that wasn't what defeated the batsman; it was more the drift that was taking the ball away.

Couple of short of length deliveries before the full one, Watson's feet went nowhere as he tried to get bat on ball, beaten for sheer pace and the ball uproots the off-stump.

With a leg slip in place, Raina had to find other areas to play the short ball, so he moves away to leg and tries to flat-bat it over long-on, got it off the toe-end and it still almost cleared long-on. Southee first held on to the catch, then saw himself overbalancing, threw the ball up and went out before coming back in to complete the catch.

Not sure why he has been subdued today despite getting the wickets. Probably the pressure leading upto today is the reason. Coming to the wicket, not the kind of shot Mandeep should be playing when you are trying to rebuild. Tries to take Jaddu on with a slog sweep but doesn't quite get hold of it.

He was early into the flick stroke on seeing the flight and only managed a leading edge straight back to Jaddu who accepts it. Again no real celebrations from Jadeja. This has been a fantastic spell from the left-arm spinner. Fair to say that he has made a fine comeback after all the criticism.

Wonderfully bowled this, slowed it up and got a bit of drift as well. Lured Ashwin into pushing at it and this just straightened a tad to beat the edge.

What a horror stroke from de Grandhomme though? He knew that all the responsibility was now down to him and instead of playing through, he decides to go for broke. Never the pitch for that kind of batting and he departs. A cutter on a good length and he tried to slog this away but only managed to skew this high towards extra cover.

Only factor that could favour Pant is the height. Hit in-line as well. Ball-tracker is out: 2 reds. Pitched - in-line. Impact - in-line. Wickets - umpire's call. Clipping the top of middle. What a fightback from SRH this has been. Skiddy leg-break from Rashid on a short of length, Pant went back for the pull and it didn't rise much as he expected. Misses and is rapped on the back thigh.

Dropped short and ripped away from Rahane's reach, he goes for the cut and slashes it hard in front of backward point and guess who? It's the Universal Boss, Chris Gayle.

There was risk in bringing the left-arm spinner but the idea was to tempt Parthiv into a rash stroke. He did get a couple away but not this time. It was pushed through quicker in line of the stumps and he went for a slog sweep across the line. Missed and it pinged him flush on the pads. Easy call for the umpire as far as the LBW is concerned.

Axar wasn't sure about the second, even put his hand up but Rahul was through, and he had to oblige. That's touch and go actually, the run out. Diving Axar's bat is just about at the line when Buttler takes the bails off. Oh dear, that's a tough one for the third umpire. And it's been given out..

Another short delivery around off, Watson goes for the pull once again, gets the top-edge too. But this time around it skies up towards short fine leg and Buttler has plenty of time to settle underneath and gulp it down. Second wicket of the match for Archer.

8725921,CSK 1st Inns,2.1,"Jofra Archer to Rayudu, out Bowled!! Dragged on! First ball wicket for Archer. And it is the dangerous Rayudu who has been sent back. He lets out an ooh as he sees the stumps disturbed. Back of a length delivery outside off, Rayudu stays leg-side of the ball to carve it through off, but the slow nature of the surface does not get the ball quickly to him and hence the inside edge onto the stumps.

Back of length delivery, Samson pats it towards backward point and takes a couple of steps down the pitch, which lured Buttler for the single. However, Samson was guilty of ball-watching and quickly turned his back to him, while Buttler ran through to the striker's end. Eventually, Samson may have sacrificed himself.

Jaddu gets enough rip off the pitch, lands it around the ideal length and gets some purchase off the surface, hits the seam and turns just enough to kiss the outside edge. Raina at first slip has bucket hands, he doesn't miss many, does he? Rahane was caught in two minds there, wasn't fully forward neither back, just hung in there and poked at it.

Switched to round the wicket and fired the full delivery outside off, Axar moved a bit and lofted it to long-off. The length was tad too full and hence Axar could not get underneath it.

Banged in short at a good pace and again the batsman never got a lot of distance on it. The ball went really high and the fielder did well to munch on it. KXIP have already got their back broken.

Takes the catch at extra cover and flings the ball at the stumps, and aggressively. A little OTT, the celebrations, but RR will take it. A short ball from Stokes does the trick.

Drifted across from over the wicket and it spun into the left-hander, surprising him with the turn. Pitching just outside off-stump -- slowmo replays suggest -- and rapping the front leg near the knee-roll. Impact on middle and that's crashing into the top of leg-stump, says ball-tracking.

The height is not an issue. Three Reds. RR are going down like a lead balloon. The ball skidded on and the batsman was late on the attempted swat on the on-side. This is tragedy for RR.

They may be right!! It seems the batsman did jam it out off the inner half of the bat but into his boot. And then it went up for DK to take it and bring to the notice of the umpires that they should go upstairs.

The batsman knelt down, may be guessed the pace right, but could not connect at all for the LED bails to lighten up. KKR camp is chuffed. So is the crowd and the entire team.

The bowler does a cool fist pump to celebrate the wicket. Kohli knew he had to do something against Gowtham, struggled in the first over, and decided to step out, but cleverly bowled by Gowtham, going wide of the crease and darting in a fast offie, which breaks in through the bat-pad gap to take Kohli's off stump out. They check for the no-ball on the side crease, but Gowtham had his leg up in the air and didn't land. A body blow to RCB. Kohli b Gowtham 4(9)",Gowtham to Kohli,OUT

Got beaten and was struck on the pads. The umpire took his time to give his decision but in the end he's right. So, finally Rahane' struggle comes to an end.

It was an off-pace ball and KW had to generate some power to elevate it over the fielder's head. 2 or 3 inches away from Russel, it would've been a boundary.

Big moment. The soft signal is out. And it doesn't take long for the third umpire to uphold the onfield call. Dhoni looks a bit miffed as he crosses his arms. Full ball, not an easy length to get under, which is why Chahar's loft hardly finds much elevation. It's a flat hit in front of long-on, with the ball dipping on Brathwaite and making him the second favourite.

Clever bowling, expected Narine to give the charge and hung it up in the air a touch more on a slightly shorter length. The West Indian didn't bother adjusting to the length, that's not his way anyway and goes through with the shot. A bit of grip off the surface and whizzes past the edge. Easy for Klaasen.

So Shaw may have missed out on becoming the youngest IPL centurion, but he becomes the second in these 12 seasons to get out on 99. It's all about getting into trivia books after all, right?!

Ashwin wanted to heave it into the cow corner fence and the top-edge went straight up towards point, Pant ran across even as Avesh steadied himself under it, the ball hit Pant's gloves and then popped up, Avesh was the first to react and he claims the catch.

Angles it across after pitching in on leg and middle, straightens, does the leg-spinner, and Sam Curran is trapped on the backfoot, trying to tuck across the line - but the whippy action and the lack of backspin means that it will hurry on and he is trapped in front.

The wrong 'un spinning across the left hander, Hetmyer stays back and has a tentative poke at that, feathers an outside edge and Buttler does the rest behind the wicket.

No need to appeal for this - a corker from Gopal and he has got rid of the RCB and India captain - A loose shot from Kohli, another wrong 'un and he didn't read it, lazily pressed forward on the drive - big gap between bat and pad and the ball found its way through, crashed into the off and middle stump and Kohli has to go.

Another wrong 'un, think AB read as he went back, stayed a bit low and that meant the ball caught the leading edge on the flick.

Pays the price for doing so. Smart bowling from Chahal, though. A slow, tossed up ball outside off, which spun further away from the right-handed batsman.

Was late to get his bat down and fails to read it. It thuds him on the pad - in-line with the stumps. Total misjudgement from the RR skipper, looked plumb straightaway and the umpire was spot on.

But what a corker from Behrendorff this was. Pounded it short, sprang up like a spitting Cobra after hitting the deck just outside off. Rayudu was just pushing his bat forward aiming to defend. Scary extra bounce scraps the shoulder of the bat and carries to QDK. Behrendorff is elated and Mumbai have struck early. Rayudu c de Kock b Behrendorff 0(1)",Behrendorff to Rayudu,OUT

Both openers back in the shed for CSK and it's been a wonderful start for Mumbai. Short and well wide of off, Watson cuts and doesn't keep it down. Hits it airly and finds Pollard, who leaps and it bobbled out of his hands, but he keeps his calm and grabs it on the second attempt. Wankhede explodes..

Tries but doesn't work. Stepped out in a premeditated manner and Hardik smartly dug it short, at the body, cramping MS completely. The result is a forced pull and it's aerial too.

Made room for the big shot but this was in the blockhole, cramped him as well and he got a faint inside edge. De Kock was initially blinded, as keepers usually are in such a scenario, but reacted sharply with a two-handed diving catch to his left.

His batting form may have dipped but not his fielding and catching. This is smart field placement from Rohit and Behrendorff executed it well. Dug it short and offered width, Raina forgets there's a fielder at sweeper cover. Slashed it on the up and Pollard was waiting for it. Though he kind of charged in a bit early, he made sure he kept his calm and stretched his giant right hand to nonchalantly grab it. Dives and thumps his chest towards the MI fans in the stands.

Flighted delivery pitching on the off stump and spinning away sharply, Rohit tried defending but the feet were stuck in the crease. Dhoni made no mistake and also checked the bails off to be doubly sure about the dismissal as Ro was close with his back foot in the crease. Tough catch because the ball almost shaved the off stump as well. Oh they are checking for the no-ball, Raina blocks the side angle from deep cover, but the other angle shows a very minute portion of the heel to be behind the crease when Jadeja landed.

Tries to go over cover but it's the slower ball that's well wide outside off, he had to reach it and mistimed it horribly. Spoons a dolly to extra cover.

Ushered it short at an awkward height for Narine - tucking him for room, who tamely pulls it without any timing. Loops up to Negi at fine leg who has to cover some ground and also mind the ad cushions.

Negi had been getting it to turn since ball one and with Lynn not being great against spin, this was on the cards. He was premeditating the charge down the track and Negi smartly held the length back. Kept it straighter too on middle and leg, spun sharply past the outside edge to make a mess of the stumps.

Kishan pats it towards cover and sets off, Pollard doesn't move and the young man has to turn back, run and puts in the dive as well. By this time, Bairstow had disturbed the stumps with his pad before the throw came but he ensured he uprooted one of the stumps with the ball in his hand.

Kolkata are dominos and Harbhajan - if not pushing them out on his own, continues having himself in some form or the other on the scorecard. This time, courtesy a lame flick uppishly off his legs, picking out a funky silly mid-on perfectly. Prasidh c Harbhajan b Jadeja 0(2)",Jadeja to Prasidh,OUT
7815415,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Chahar to Nitish Rana, out Caught by Rayudu!! Sharp stuff from Rayudu! KKR are falling apart quite early here. The shot selection is going awry at the moment. This was slightly short but not much bounce as Rana looked to whip this away aerially on the leg-side. Didn't get the required timing as it dipped on short mid-wicket where Rayudu took a really sharp catch. Nitish Rana c Rayudu b Chahar 0(3)",Chahar to Nitish Rana,OUT
7815415,KKR 1st Inns,4.4,"Chahar to Uthappa, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Outrageous shot from Uthappa! Was looking in good touch but just when he should have started to kick on, falls to a terrible stroke. Despite a deep mid-wicket in place, he goes for the aerial pull off the shortish length ball that had no pace at all. Gets it off the top half of the blade and it's a rather easy catch for Jadhav stationed there, precisely for this kind of a stroke. It's one-way traffic in Chepauk at the moment. KKR don't seem to have turned up yet. Uthappa c Kedar Jadhav b Chahar 11(9) [4s-2]",Chahar to Uthappa,OUT
7815415,KKR 1st Inns,8.4,"Tahir to Karthik, out Caught by Harbhajan!! Redemption for Tahir. Sombre faces among KKR fans in the stands and Tahir unleashes the Baby-in-the-arms celebration for a change. No celebratory run on this occasion. But poor shot this from Karthik. Just runs out of patience and goes hard on the whippy flick, hits it airly and finds Bhajji at short mid-wicket, who takes a sharp catch. Tahir gave more flight and it kind of dipped which tempted the KKR captain into playing that false shot. Karthik c Harbhajan b Tahir 19(21) [4s-3]",Tahir to Karthik,OUT

This is the exact kind of delivery that was disappearing earlier in the night when the Jamaican got stuck into Behrendorff. But after a brief delay where he was attended by the physio, Gayle - even Gayle - fails to find the strength to clear deep midwicket. It's right in the slot for him, but he drags it off the inside half to Krunal Pandya. Gayle c Krunal Pandya b Behrendorff 63(36) [4s-3 6s-7]",Behrendorff to Gayle,OUT

He was taken for 17 in his first over, but has come back strongly. Low full toss at the stumps, Nair attempts a cross-batted swing - more like a sweep, and skies it up off a thick top-edge.

Surely might have been frustrated at the onslaught in the over and although it's not the wicket KXIP wanted, it's definitely potential danger out of the way. Was a good full ball that cramped up Pollard on leg stump. He squeezed it to the left of Curran who was quick to get to the ball and fired a direct hit at the bowler's end.

Not a wicket-taking ball, was actually in the slot but was pacy from Shami and Hardik didn't get hold of it. Never really got going tonight to be honest and the miscue finds a gleeful Miller at long-on. Dolly it is and that's the end of HP.

Removes the Pandyas and now, Pollard is stranded with the tail left. This was a slower ball, comfortably slower than his stock pace and Krunal got early into the loft. Ends up chipping it towards extra cover where it's that man, Miller, again. Another sitter for the South African. Krunal Pandya c Miller b Shami 1(2)",Shami to Krunal Pandya,OUT

The big man thought he had hit another six, the match-winning one but nope, he's found Miller at deep mid-wicket. Was a short ball outside off, had to really fetch it but Pollard rode his luck on the pull. Could only sky it high and not long enough. What a turnaround! Rajpoot could still be the hero. Wowza!

4702243,CSK 1st Inns,0.4,"D Kulkarni to Watson, out Bowled!! That is a peach, an absolute peach. Give Kulkarni the new cherry and more often than not he will deliver. It was on a good length and it shapes away from Watson a bit, he wanted to whip it across the line, ends up playing it down the wrong line. It breaches his defence and clatters the stumps. The horrible season for Watson continues. Watson b D Kulkarni 0(4)",D Kulkarni to Watson,OUT
4702243,CSK 1st Inns,1.5,"Unadkat to Raina, out Raina Run Out!! Stephen Fleming shakes his head in the dug-out. And this is probably the first time he is showing discontentment in this IPL season. It was on a length and Raina tucks it straight to Archer at short fine, Faf charges for a single and Raina for some reason instead of running was ball-watching ( A criminal thing to do). Archer picks it up cleanly and smashes the stumps at the non striker's end where Raina was short of the crease. RR are off to a perfect start.

He may have misjudged it initially, came running in, but then has to cut back to the right, almost going zig-zag. Eventually takes it behind his body. It's the slower ball from Stokes that brings out the miscue from Rayudu, and these long square boundaries ensure that it doesn't go over.

And look at Unadkat, he is pumped. It was a short of length delivery around hip-height, du Plessis pulled and he gave the impression that he got decent amount of willow behind it.

A nothing shot from one of the premier batsman across every format - this was tossed up around middle, Smith bent down on the slog sweep, didn't get close to the ball and only managed to shovel it into the safe hands of Rayudu at deep mid-wicket.

Clearly no bat. The impact is on middle and ball-tracking shows it to be hitting leg! Bruce Oxenford has overturned his original decision. The bowler had a lengthy chat with skipper and a jovial-looking MS Dhoni signalled 'T' only at the last second. Turned out to be the correct move.

After hitting three successive boundaries, Buttler tries to play another biggie. He hung back and wanted to thump it downtown - this short of length delivery - similar to the shot he played off Chahar. But, this time, Jos lost his shape in the process and the ball ballooned up a long way off the top part of the bat. Rayudu settles under it at the extra cover region and snaffles with both hands.

Hint of away-spin, and Samson doesn't get the timing right on his one-legged sweep. It was on the leg-stump line and hence Samson went for that shot.

Not what Ponting wanted either and not what he himself wanted ahead of the WC selection. All these little things matter. Fantastic knock but he has thrown it away at the brink of it. 17 still needed.

Didn't get it fully right and was a low full toss but induced the slice from Russell who didn't get the desired connection. It's flat and towards deep backward point where Rabada accepts it with glee. This wicket will definitely make a difference of 15-20 runs to the eventual total and DC know it.

He never got going today though, seemed scratchy and even disinterested a bit. Had to launch now with enough batting in the shed and opts for the muscular slog of his. The length isn't there and the result is a miscue that goes miles in the air. Brilliant catch from Gopal who steadied himself nicely at mid-wicket to take it with a tumble.

But that's the hallmark of a superb fielder, made it look like regulation stuff. Ends a fine knock from de Kock who was visibly jaded. Went for the loft but was undone by the slower ball this time.

Kohli absolutely smashes this pull shot, but it goes straight to Murugan Ashwin who was standing at least 15-20 yards inside the boundary. That positioning was probably to stop the second run, which this pair has so frequently charged for to exploit the long boundary. But it works brilliantly in a separate context here. Short ball, hammered off the front foot well in front of square, it goes flat and hard - straight to deep midwicket. Ashwin comes charging across in celebration. There might yet be some more chapters to write before this game is done. Kohli c Murugan Ashwin b Shami 67(53) [4s-8]",Shami to Kohli,OUT

Sensed Parthiv giving the charge and slowed it down considerably, while also dragging the length back ever so slightly.

Jadhav's been trapped in front but he walks down the pitch to have a chat with Raina in quest for a review but nope, the Southpaw advises him against going for the review and off he goes. Eden explodes. Chawla picks up his second wicket and he's keeping KKR in the game. Such a vital wicket this because Jadhav was looking ominous. Quicker delivery, skidded through after pitching and KJ misjudged it, ended up playing it down the wrong line and it pings him on the front pad.

There's some turn, and Dhoni is well forward. So there's a chance it might go down. No, it doesn't. Per ball-tracking, it's crashing leg stump - three reds. KKR needed this desperately to have any hope of getting back. And they're surely back in it now.

He's been short on confidence with the ball in this tournament but this wicket is a much-needed boost. Poor shot from du Plessis, perhaps was tempted by the flight there as he leant forward aiming for an agricultural heave, didn't fully commit himself as the ball dipped in after pitching.

He's deceived him with the off-cutter here. It was slanted across well wide of off, Buttler - almost premeditatedly - wanted to slug it through midwicket but goes through with it too early.

Umpire's call on hitting and he has to go. Hasn't been at his fluent best and this shot is a firm proof of that. Just looks to slog without having a real sense of where the ball pitched and he loses his shape in the process, swings way too early and Rashid's floaty legbreak clonks him in front of middle.

Has it done too much though, the googly? He's struck in line with off and there's another umpire's call on hitting. Shaving the top of leg peg. OUT!! A rather simple set-up this from Rashid, bowled the wrong 'un and gave it ample flight to draw Jadhav on the front foot.

Shaw settled underneath the skier at deep mid-wicket and holds on. What are KXIP trying to achieve? This isn't a 200 wicket for sure. Miller c Prithvi Shaw b Axar 7(5) [4s-1]",Axar to Miller,OUT

Bhuvi looks to pin the yorker but feeds a low full toss on the pads instead, Russell batters it off the cue end and he didn't get as much of an elevation as he would have liked.

Tried the yorker - didn't work. What was left? The slower ball - worked. The off-cutter and it holds up on the surface, Narine is through his heave early and the ball arrives later to uproot the leg-stump.

This was a suicidal second by DK and he's livid with himself. Had flicked the flatter delivery to deep mid-wicket and two was the call straightaway. He decides to take on one of the best fielders in SRH's team though. Shankar charges in towards the ball, gathers it neatly and gets rid of the ball in the blink of an eye.

That flew off the blade and was taken by the slip fielder who sat under it and took it over his head. Nice carry off the wicket as the batter threw his hands at it. CSK have lost Watto early, again.

He had rushed Dhoni for pace with this short ball, inducing a mistimed pull shot beside the pitch. Dhoni initially came down for a single, which set Jadeja on his way, but then turned his back on him. There was no turning back for Jadeja from there.

But RCB, who almost looked like having a meltdown in the final over, have been bailed out by a direct-hit from Parthiv Patel. Very brave from Umesh initially to go for the slower off-cutter. And his execution is spot on, as it sneaks through Dhoni's attempted cut. They have to run, and Parthiv is alert to it. With the ball bouncing just in front of him, the gather couldn't have been easy, but he makes no mistake and his throw at the stumps is on target too, finding Thakur just short.

Ah, this is some night for the RCB fans. Umesh kept rattling the batsmen with pace and something had to give; Jadhav tries to go across the line and doesn't bother to move his feet while at it.

Credit to Shorey as well not to distract Faf and also linger closeby in case something like this happened. Superb presence of mind to throw the ball away in the nick of the time.

Short of length outside off, slower one, Vijay mistimes the cut in front of backward point. Now then, Surya was diving forward there. Did he have his fingers underneath? The ball has bounced into his palm, but did it bounce off the fingertips, or the ground? Tough call with the replays that are available. Soft signal is out, so that may be telling. Or does the third umpire have enough evidence to overrule the soft signal? No he doesn't. OUT on the big screen. CSK dugout doesn't look too happy.

Quality of a champion bowler. It was a well-disguised slower delivery, de Kock was totally taken aback by it. His bat swing came down much much early, it clipped his top-edge and went straight up in the air. Rayudu with the gloves takes it with ease.

The ball ballooned up and Smith ran back and to his right from mid-off before putting a full-stretched dive. He kept his eyes on the ball and completed a superb catch.

It was the googly and Manish Pandey was cramped for room. He was looking to guide it to third man and it went off the face of the bat. Samson caught it and then dislodged the bails. Wierdly, the keeper didn't appeal for caught-behind. The TV umpire was called for a stumping appeal and Pandey's back leg was in the air.

Gets it off the top-half, Bhuvi at fine leg, charges forward, dives in a dramatic fashion and takes a beauty. Pooran c Bhuvneshwar b Khaleel Ahmed 21(10) [4s-2 6s-2]",Khaleel Ahmed to Pooran,OUT
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,12.5,"Rashid Khan to Miller, out Caught by Shankar!! Second for Rashid. Not the greatest of deliveries but SRH won't be complaining. Another one of KXIP's big hitters is back in the pavilion. It was a half tracker and Miller picked it early, went back and pulled it flat to deep mid-wicket. He just could not place it better.

9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,13.0,"Rashid Khan to Ashwin, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Rashid is on a hat-trick. Ashwin coming ahead of debutant Prabhsimran doesn't pay off. What started with a boundary has ended with two wickets. Googly outside off, Ashwin spotted it off the hand and heaved it with the spin, but could not generate power to clear long-on.

9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,18.2,"Khaleel Ahmed to Rahul, out Caught by Williamson!! Fine catch! Khaleel picks up his third wicket. He's been the pick of the bowlers along with Rashid. Change of pace and Rahul went after it, cleared his front leg and swung as hard as possible, came off the toe-end and went straight up, Williamson ran across from extra cover and took it near mid-off. It was in the air for a long time and the skipper had to put in a dive to take it. Rahul c Williamson b Khaleel Ahmed 79(56) [4s-4 6s-5]",Khaleel Ahmed to Rahul,OUT
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,19.1,"Sandeep Sharma to Simran Singh, out Lbw!! Looked a 50-50 call and that's why only Sandeep went up for it. A slow dipping yorker and Simran swings blindly without watching the ball, the ball lands in front of him and strikes him on the back leg around leg-stump. Ball-tracking has to be kissing the stumps.

Goes hard at a length delivery and gets a top-edge that goes miles up in the air. Manish at point settles under it and takes it, not on the first but on the second attempt. The ball almost popped out of Manish's hands who did well to cling on the catch eventually. Sunrisers on top! Gayle c Manish Pandey b Khaleel Ahmed 4(3) [4s-1]",Khaleel Ahmed to Gayle,OUT
9097534,KXIP 1st Inns,8.4,"Rashid Khan to Agarwal, out Caught by Shankar!! Mayank gets greedy there. And he pays the price for it. Rashid is so skilfull a bowler that you just can't hit him for consecutive sixes. It was a flighted delivery on the stumps, Agarwal goes down on his knees and wanted to launch it over deep mid-wicket, fails to connect as well as he would have liked. And ends up gifting a catch to Shankar at deep mid-wicket. Agarwal c Shankar b Rashid Khan 27(18) [4s-2 6s-1]",Rashid Khan to Agarwal,OUT
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,15.3,"Ashwin to Manish Pandey, out Caught by Shami!! Ashwin removes Pandey. Finally, a wicket for KXIP which should give them some lift. Wasn't that great a delivery from Ashwin. Rifled it quick - the carrom ball and down leg, Pandey tried to be cheeky and thought of helping it over the man at 45. But he didn't get the required timing to clear the fielder and hits it to Shami at short fine leg, who clings onto it. First wicket for Ashwin and let's see if they can put the brakes from here.

9097534,SRH 1st Inns,16.0,"Ashwin to Warner, out Caught by Mujeeb!! Wow! Is this the game-changing over from Ashwin? He's gotten rid of both the set-batsmen in this over and Warner is livid with himself as he thuds his bat onto his pads. But doesn't matter because he's played a fabulous knock here. The Hyderabad crowd gives him a rousing reception. It was the round-arm darter from Ashwin, bowled it quick outside off. Warner with a tired looking shot as he threw his bat and skews it up towards point, who takes a couple of steps back and grabs it. Warner c Mujeeb b Ashwin 81(56) [4s-7 6s-2]",Ashwin to Warner,OUT
9097534,SRH 1st Inns,18.2,"Shami to Williamson, out Caught by Murugan Ashwin!! That's a stunning catch by Murugan Ashwin at cover as he times his jump to perfection and plucks it out of thin air. Was a back of a length delivery and Williamson had chipped it in order to clear the infield, however the fielder does well to pull off a blinder. With 10 balls remaining, Williamson had to go for it and perishes in his quest to get some quick runs. Williamson c Murugan Ashwin b Shami 14(7) [4s-1 6s-1]",Shami to Williamson,OUT

9097534,SRH 1st Inns,6.2,"Murugan Ashwin to Saha, out Caught by Simran Singh!! Murugan draws first blood! Was a quickish slider and Saha wanted to pull across the line. Got a tiny under edge and Simran Singh who had looked awful initially, held on to a brilliant catch. The fun part began after this, because the appeal for caught behind wasn't given at first. As KXIP were about to review, the umpire raised his finger but Saha didn't probably see that. He was standing with Warner, which made it seem like he wanted the review. It seems like he wasn't clear of the decision and once it was clarified, he walked away Saha c Simran Singh b Murugan Ashwin 28(13) [4s-3 6s-1]",Murugan Ashwin to Saha,OUT

He's been a star for RR and continues to impress. Well-flighted delivery again, drawing de Villiers into a false shot. AB wielded his bat hard, loses his balance and shape completely. Skies it into the night sky as the timing goes for a toss. Riyan Parag at extra cover calls for it and settles under it. Big setback this for RCB.

He resurrected the innings after a slow start and given them the impetus going into the final 5 overs. He looks to go across the line against a ball that is angled across him, slices it off the outer half towards backward point, Dhawan gets into all sorts of tangle as he runs back, but he manages to hang on to it.

Thrown wider of off, Suchith leans across and pushes it to point. Watto sprawls across, collects it and nails the stumps at the non-striker's end.

This is a crucial wicket for SRH as we all know how dangerous Hardik can be towards the back-end of the innings. It was banged in short, the batsman wasn't expecting it. Gets cramped for pace and room, went for the pull and poor connection sees him slicing it off the top half of the bat to long-off. Nabi takes the sitter.

Ends up taking the upper half of the bat and picks out the only man out there, deep square leg. Gayle c Shubman Gill b Warrier 14(14) [4s-2]",Warrier to Gayle,OUT
5231019,DC 1st Inns,13.4,"Ish Sodhi to Ingram, out Caught by Rahane!! And when Pant's extravaganza doesn't consume him, Ingram's cheek will. So he tries to be cute, with a late fine sweep past the keeper. But in his pre-guessing, gets a little too early into it and the length's just too full for it as well, resulting in a glove, popping up off his shoulder to a very-alert Rahane - at slip - who runs to where a leg-slip would've been.

He might have been smashed for a six, but now with nothing to lose - except this match which is alrady lost - Gopal tosses his googly up. Rutherford charges down, doesn't really get close enough but still goes through with the hoick. Ends up with a massive miscues to long-on, where Livingstone runs in to, and then adjusts really well to the ball dipping behind him.

Charged down the track, decided to launch it in the 'V' but gets it off the bottom part of the bat. Skies it up in the air and Parag from mid-on calls for it, keeps his eyes on the ball and cups it safely. RR have their first wicket, can they nip out a few more?

Another flop show from Shaw - getting dismissed again for a single-digit score. The top-spinner from Sodhi, gave more loop and Shaw opted to play it on the off-side staying back in his crease. Goes hard away from the body and gets a thick inside edge which shatters back onto the stumps. Sodhi is elated. Prithvi Shaw b Ish Sodhi 8(8) [4s-1]",Ish Sodhi to Prithvi Shaw,OUT

Shreyas gets the prized scalp of Iyer, who can't believe his luck that he's holed out to the fielder. Shreyas continues to grow from strength to strength and provides his team a crucial breakthrough. Throws it up luringly, Iyer takes his front leg out of the way and launches it down the ground. The timing goes haywire and picks out Livingstone at long-on, who didn't have to move an inch.

This is the most ordinary batting performance we have seen by any side in this year's IPL. It was a flighted delivery on the stumps, Gowtham charges down, wanted to loft it over long-off.

That's a soft dismissal for the captain - a leg-stump half-volley from Ishant, Rahane was looking to work it to the on-side, closed the bat-face early, gets a fat leading edge, high and behind square on the on-side. Dhawan called for the catch, gets across from deep backward square leg, watches the ball all along and completes the catch - cuts to his trademark thighslap celebrations, the Royals have lost an easrly wicket.

The fallacy of the Kotla wicket does Livingstone in - this wasn't a slower ball, but there's no pace on this off-cutter - Livingstone came down the track and was way too early on the slog - completed the shot even before the ball arrived, let a big gap between bat and pad - the ball found its way and rattled the top of middle-stump.

This is disaster for the Royals - zero communication from both batsman - Lomror kept screaming at his partner who was oblivious to his call, kept running down the track aand then had nowhere to go. This was tossed up on off and Samson pushed it towards cover-point, he took a step down the track and stopped, so did his partner and then suddenly Samson had this urge to run - kept running even as his partner asked him to go back.

Rare failure for PP as RCB lose their first wicket. Lenght delivery that gained some extra bounce, Patel was rooted to the crease and whips his bat across.

It was short, it was wide and there was width. Kohli wanted to have a piece of it, throwing his bat at it. Only succeeds in feeding an outside edge. Saha grabs it in front of his face and Ahmed didn't wait for the catch to be taken. Roars and redeems himself after getting slammed for a four and a six earlier in the over.

It means a lot to these players. Kohli appreciates the effort from the balcony. It was well wide of off, Hetmyer wanted to lift it over long-off. It wasn't timed as well as compared to his previous shots. And Vijay Shankar takes a brilliant catch at long-off. He knew exactly where the ropes were and made sure he didn't touch it.

Like Kohli, it's a sorry end to de Villiers' IPL campaign as he falls cheaply. But it was a nothing shot from the South African. It was shortish and curled away outside off, he just flirted his bat at it without any intent and guided it straight into the hands of Guptill at slip. VVS Laxman is all smiles in the dug-out.

Shankar tries tonking another, revealing his cards a touch too early as he commits down on a knee. Sundar spots, shortens his length a wee bit, letting the ball spin in, which it does to take the eventual top-edge, and CdG isn't messing up the skier, waiting patiently under at short fine leg.

He does it with a pretty innocuous-looking short-wide sitter outside off, but it's foxed Pathan to go hard at it, which he does without a lot of control.

Was he under control? Sunil Gavaskar thinks it's NOT OUT as he wasn't in complete control. But what will the third umpire think? He thinks Manish is OUT. Two wickets in the over and RCB are pulling things back - this was dropped short and Manish's eyes lit up - rocked back on the pull, didn't get hold of the shot, was in the air for a long time, Hetmyer got across from deep mid-wicket, slid forward and completed a good two-handed catch.

Malinga's ploy to bowl round the wicket has worked. Dug in short and gets it to climb near chest high, Russell arches back to evade it but leaves his gloves hanging mid-air, there is a brush and de Kock does the rest.

Floated up by Harbhajan, de Kock creates room seeking for the inside-out loft and ends up lofting it towards du Plessis at long-off who moved to his right and gobbled it up. The fielder was a bit wider and de Kock intended it to go more squarer there. Unfortunately, picked out the fielder. Both openers back in the hut for MI.

He might have actually been reprieved first up, think he gloved the pull and KL spilled it - the ball rolled wide of him and Dhawan thought there was a single on offer - dashed way down the track only to watch his partner motionless at the other end. Too late to return, KL ran across, collected the ball and lobbed in a throw at the striker's end - Gowtham was waiting for it and breaks the stumps, with a disconsolate Dhawan stranded in the middle.

Not a wise shot from Iyer at this stage. It was fuller just outside off, Iyer knew the mid-off was inside the ring, so got tempted and wanted to lift it over him.

So, they are referring it to the third umpire. Axar is also asked to wait. No doubt about the glove, it's all about the catch. It's dipping on the way to Rahul and seems like he's grabbed it cleanly. OUT is the decision and the batsman can continue his walk back to the hut. Delhi are falling away quickly. A back of a length, veering down leg.

Never looked comfortable at the crease to be honest. Pattinson just kept it short and took it away from him. The Southpaw went for the cross-batted pull and it didn't really come off for him, de Kock timed his jump to perfection and snatched it with one glove.

Big call to trust him with this over after Saini had gone for a few, but Pooran has just thrown it away. Charges down, converts it into an overpitched delivery and drills it straight to AB at mid-off. The idea was to place it wide of the fielder like he done to Umesh but Pooran was not able to do that.

Watson will be kicking himself there, couldn't have placed it any better.

UltraEdge confirms that there's no bat on that, Hawk-Eye in and it's three REDS. Karthik is OUT and KKR have wasted their review. Lovely delivery from Khan, slipped in the wrong 'un and Karthik didn't spot it - ended up playing outside the line as he lunged forward.

That's enough for the third umpire to overturn the original call. Warner is OUT. Think it's a fair decision from the third umpire, Chris Gaffaney. The spike wasn't huge, but there seemed to be a deviation when the ball went past the gloves - Warner was attempting the reverse sweep to one that drifted across him - caught the glove and Pant stood low to hold on.
