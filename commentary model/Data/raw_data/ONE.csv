4281444,RCB 1st Inns,16.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Binny, 1 run, dropped! Naman Ojha, with the gloves on, puts one down. The ball went high up and was swirling awkwardly all the way through. But at this level, it should be taken. Binny was completely duped by the slower leg-cutter. Such good bowling from Bhuvi to keep it wide of off and out of reach",Bhuvneshwar to Binny,ONE
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,13.0,"Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj, 1 run, oh Aravind. You really do not grant a life. Certainly not to this guy. Another compulsive pull here from Yuvraj but with the ball gaining in height, only manages the top-edge. Right into the hands of fine leg, who slides and makes an absolute mess",Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj,ONE
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,15.5,"Chahal to Yuvraj, 1 run, is that a bird? Is that a plane? Oh it is Mandeep Singh on his flying ways. Yuvraj goes through with yet another ones of his delightful airy drives. Is in the process of admiration just as Mandy runs across at the long-off fence, leaps and pulls it back into the field of play. Almost plucked it out while landing down too. Oof",Chahal to Yuvraj,ONE
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,3.5,"Chahal to Henriques, 1 run, a direct hit at the bowler's end and Henriques was struggling. He was coming back for the second run, Dhawan didn't respond one bit. Aravind was the man with the throw and he sent it to the keeper. Kedar Jadhav still had time to effect the run-out, but his shy is way off-target. Henriques scrambles home with a dive. Coming to the ball, it was flat and wide of off, punched to the left of long-off",Chahal to Henriques,ONE
7898444,MI 1st Inns,3.0,"Dinda to Parthiv Patel, 1 run, dropped by Bhatia. A straightforward chance. Parthiv Patel doesn't get control of the cut and he slices it straight to third man, Bhatia didn't even need to move an inch. It was going arrow straight towards his chest. Straight in and straight out. Oops!",Dinda to Parthiv Patel,ONE
7898444,MI 1st Inns,7.1,"Stokes to Rayudu, 1 run, direct hit and Rayudu was gone! Smith was the fielder, curses himself after he missed the target. A casual knock down the wicket from Rayudu, goes straight to mid-off, Smithy had ample time to target all three at the non-striker's end. A big miss",Stokes to Rayudu,ONE
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,13.0,"McClenaghan to Smith, 1 run, dropped! It's Nitish Rana in the deep. The ball flew towards his left and he was on the move but he got there with both hands. Exquisite timing on the short-arm pull from Smith. It's precisely that which gets him in trouble. Rana provides the reprieve. The ball actually hit him flush on the shoulders. That's quite an error. Huge moment",McClenaghan to Smith,ONE
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,19.0,"Bumrah to Dhoni, 1 run, dropped! An absolute sitter put down by Southee. Oh boy. They've already dropped Smith earlier. That hasn't quite gone well. Now another one. Dhoni miscues the full toss to deep mid-wicket where Southee doesn't have to move. Dear me",Bumrah to Dhoni,ONE
2373690,GL 1st Inns,16.1,"Chawla to Raina, 1 run, fifty for Raina. 29th in IPL. Not one of his best. Quicker delivery on the stumps, clocked at 113kph, that's the pace of Bhatia. Raina is hurried into the flick and sends it along the ground to deep mid-wicket",Chawla to Raina,ONE
2373690,GL 1st Inns,16.3,"Chawla to Raina, 1 run, dropped! Would you believe it? I have lost count of the number of chances Raina has got today. Flighted delivery on the stumps, Raina kneels down and sweeps to deep backward square, went straight to Yusuf and he split it. He was on the move a bit and that put him off. He's been whisked away from that position by a stoic GG",Chawla to Raina,ONE
2373690,GL 1st Inns,17.1,"Boult to Raina, 1 run, Raina backs away and Boult follows him with a yorker, squeezed to backward point",Boult to Raina,ONE
2373690,GL 1st Inns,18.2,"Woakes to Raina, 1 run, Raina and Woakes collide. Short and slow outside off, Raina cuts it on the bounce to backward point. Both were ball watching and Raina dashed into the bowler, Woakes is down on the ground and Raina makes his crease. The GL skipper goes back to check on Woakes and the Englishman is fine",Woakes to Raina,ONE

2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,4.1,"Stokes to Saha, 1 run, a very tough chance goes down! Saha prods forward and drills the cover drive. Dan Christian, at cover leaps to his right and gets a hand to it. Those are the ones that need to stick. Wasn't the case this time",Stokes to Saha,ONE
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,17.0,"Mohit Sharma to Stokes, 1 run, clears his front leg and shovels it down the ground. The yorkers keeping him quiet(er). Nevertheless, the half-ton comes up",Mohit Sharma to Stokes,ONE
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,3.2,"Mohit Sharma to Rahane, 1 run, DROPPED!! The man at cover - Vohra had enough time to settle down under it by going back but he makes a meal of it. That was a nothing shot to a length ball and the ball scooped high up in the air and never scaled any distance. Vohra was put off by Natarajan at mid-off who was just beside him. The former could see the fast bowler from the corner of his eye and that was enough",Mohit Sharma to Rahane,ONE
7088566,DC 1st Inns,17.3,"Tymal Mills to Pant, 1 run, beautiful slower ball, it's all the more effective with Mills bowling it. Pant is deceived by the lack of pace and he has to reach out as a result. He skews it right off the toe-end to mid-on. It's fifty for Pant. Superb knock, but he has to go all the way",Tymal Mills to Pant,ONE
7200146,GL 1st Inns,17.1,"Nehra to D Kulkarni, 1 run, wristed into the on-side, takes off for a quick single before being sent back. Rashid fires at the bowler's end and misses. The duo run on the overthrow. Karthik was in trouble had that hit",Nehra to D Kulkarni,ONE
7200146,GL 1st Inns,18.3,"Cutting to P Kumar, 1 run, silly running from the GL batsmen. Could've lost another one. A short of length delivery outside off, Kumar toe-ends the drive to extra cover, takes off for a single. The fielder collects the ball and fires a throw but misses the target. PK had given up",Cutting to P Kumar,ONE
7200146,SRH 1st Inns,17.1,"Nehra to D Kulkarni, 1 run, wristed into the on-side, takes off for a quick single before being sent back. Rashid fires at the bowler's end and misses. The duo run on the overthrow. Karthik was in trouble had that hit",Nehra to D Kulkarni,ONE

PK had given up",Cutting to P Kumar,ONE
9873957,KKR 1st Inns,17.4,"Bumrah to M Pandey, 1 run, here's his half-ton. Playing a vital hand here. Gets there with a flat batted agricultural heave. Then watches all his effort neutralized by the ball finding deep mid-wicket on the bounce",Bumrah to M Pandey,ONE
9873957,MI 1st Inns,16.5,"Woakes to Nitish Rana, 1 run, Woakes botches a run-out opportunity! He just had to collect the ball cleanly. Rana was well short. Rana couldn't find any elevation as he tried to flat-bat the back of length delivery and he hit it straight to mid-off. Never a run there, but the non-striker had come a long way down so Rana obliged. Would have been gone",Woakes to Nitish Rana,ONE
9873957,MI 1st Inns,3.4,"Woakes to Parthiv Patel, 1 run, direct hit and Parthiv was running back. Finally he connects with one of his heaves, not middled though and finds Yusuf at mid-wicket. The shy is at the bowler's end and it is way off target",Woakes to Parthiv Patel,ONE
2604889,KXIP 1st Inns,11.1,"Watson to Maxwell, 1 run, dropped by backward point, a real sitter, RCB fans can't believe it! Full and wide, Maxi slices the drive sitting deep inside his crease, it went flat and straight to Mandeep Singh. He was a tad slow to react, straight in and straight out",Watson to Maxwell,ONE
2604889,KXIP 1st Inns,5.0,"Stanlake to Vohra, 1 run, goes wide of the crease and angles one on the pads, clipped away sweetly to deep square leg. 50-up for Punjab",Stanlake to Vohra,ONE
2172197,DC 1st Inns,13.5,"Stokes to Samson, 1 run, just short of the long-on fielder and Samson reaches his fifty! Pitched up delivery, Samson lofted it over mid-on and falls in front of the diving long-on fielder. Samson collects a single to get to his milestone",Stokes to Samson,ONE

3000439,KKR 1st Inns,12.0,"Axar to Gambhir, 1 run, 33rd IPL fifty for GG. Equals Warner's record for the most number of fifties. Waves his bat around to acknowledge the Eden Garden crowd. Reaches the milestone with a wristy flick through mid-wicket",Axar to Gambhir,ONE
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,2.5,"Boult to Vohra, 1 run, Narine has shelled a sitter at third man. Oh dear. Boult just turns around in despair. A short of length delivery, Vohra tries to pull off the front foot and sends a top-edge flying down to third man. They don't come easier than that",Boult to Vohra,ONE
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,7.3,"Narine to Amla, 1 run, fires them in, 103kph, Amla punches it to the right of point and quickly goes through to the other end",Narine to Amla,ONE
3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,8.3,"Woakes to Maxwell, 1 run, dropped by Uthappa! Definitely two noises there. Back of length, cutting in and takes the inside edge.

3210359,RCB 1st Inns,12.2,"Krunal Pandya to de Villiers, 1 run, dropped! Buttler went backwards at deep-midwicket, then circled under it and drops it in the end. That was a mistimed slog-sweep and the ball stayed in the sky for a long long time. Buttler messed it up by never really judging it",Krunal Pandya to de Villiers,ONE
8517839,RPS 1st Inns,16.1,"Jadeja to Manoj Tiwary, 1 run, hammered back at the bowler and that's not really a chance. Props to Jadeja for getting his hands in position quick enough and attempt a catch but he can't hold on. It was hit powerfully. Saved a boundary really",Jadeja to Manoj Tiwary,ONE
1036316,KKR 1st Inns,5.3,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, 1 run, flicks to square leg and rushes for a non-existent single. Dhawan aims at the bowler's end and misses, had that hit Uthappa was a goner. He is living dangerously here",Rashid Khan to Uthappa,ONE
1036316,SRH 1st Inns,2.0,"Boult to Dhawan, 1 run, catch it is the cry, but Woakes can't hold onto it. That came in at a rapid pace. Once again, Dhawan gives the charge and this time he slashes it off the middle of the bat. The Englishman at cover-point dived to his right and half-stopped it. Saved three runs there",Boult to Dhawan,ONE
8351592,DC 1st Inns,12.0,"Mohit Sharma to Billings, 1 run, fifty for Billings. Raises his bat and acknowledges the applause from the home crowd. Still a long way to go for him. The pitch has started to get slower and run making is not going to be easy. With him being set, DD would want him to carry on. Coming to the ball: Plays the slower delivery with soft hands into the off-side ring and jogs across to the other end",Mohit Sharma to Billings,ONE
8351592,DC 1st Inns,6.1,"Cariappa to Billings, 1 run, rushes it through outside off, Billings goes deep in his crease and pats it softly to cover",Cariappa to Billings,ONE
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,12.0,"Corey Anderson to Miller, 1 run, is that a dropped catch? It looks like it. Another very full ball, Miller crashes it to the right of cover where Zaheer goes across low with both hands but fails to hold on",Corey Anderson to Miller,ONE
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,18.1,"Pat Cummins to Axar, 1 run, dabs a short of length off-cutter straight to short third man. They impetuously run across for a non-existent single. Mohit had given up. No direct hit though",Pat Cummins to Axar,ONE
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,4.5,"Chris Morris to Miller, 1 run, ah! A direct hit there at the striker's end would have been curtains to Eoin Morgan!

7374716,GL 1st Inns,10.3,"Krunal Pandya to Brendon McCullum, 1 run, fifty for McCullum. A very unlike McCullum innings this. Waves his bat around and is congratulated by his skipper. Looked scratchy to start off and has slowly found his bearings. GL would want him to continue. Flatter and on off, worked to deep square leg",Krunal Pandya to Brendon McCullum,ONE
7374716,GL 1st Inns,11.0,"Krunal Pandya to Raina, 1 run, direct hit and McCullum would have been on his bike. Raina punched this towards extra cover, where Suchith got a good bounce and it was to his strong hand as well. Fires a throw at the striker's end and fails to hit the stumps. McCullum was stretching and would have been touch and go",Krunal Pandya to Raina,ONE
7374716,MI 1st Inns,1.4,"Basil Thampi to Nitish Rana, 1 run, dropped! Jason Roy has put down a dolly. The pacy short ball catches Rana by surprise. He still persists with his pull shot and gets it off the top part of the willow. The ball balloons up on the leg-side. Roy, at mid-wicket, runs back, settles under it and makes a mess of it. Thampi can't believe it. He has to wait for his first IPL wicket",Basil Thampi to Nitish Rana,ONE
7374716,MI 1st Inns,16.1,"Andrew Tye to Rohit, 1 run, as expected starts with a slower delivery outside off, Rohit drives to sweeper cover",Andrew Tye to Rohit,ONE
7374716,MI 1st Inns,17.2,"Basil Thampi to Pollard, 1 run, run-out chance and Kishan hits the stump mic instead of the stumps. Pollard was a goner. Thampi nails the wide yorker, Pollard digs it to point and sets off for the single, no response from Rohit and he had to turn back, well short with a direct hit. No one backing up and the duo eventually get the single",Basil Thampi to Pollard,ONE
9515142,RCB 1st Inns,17.4,"SN Thakur to Binny, 1 run, what an effort from Stokes. This is stunning fielding. He's actually caught the ball and has control over it, but he doesn't have control over his weight which is causing him to fall over the ropes. So he has to flick it back in - does so incredibly, through his legs. Lots of height from Binny on the slog, fair amount of distance too. Stokes's foot is stationed just a foot inside the ropes at wide long-on, he takes it overhead, and flicks it in. They just take a single",SN Thakur to Binny,ONE
9515142,RCB 1st Inns,18.1,"Unadkat to Milne, 1 run, slower back of a length delivery on middle, Milne glances it to short fine leg. Badree was struggling had Thakur hit direct",Unadkat to Milne,ONE
2969824,DC 1st Inns,18.3,"Coulter-Nile to Chris Morris, 1 run, dropped! Tough chance, but when you get two hands, you have to catch it. Short delivery and Morris is hurried into the pull, spliced towards long-on. Umesh runs forward and across, overruns and the ball comes near his waist while he was diving forward, hits his hands and pops out. GG is not happy with the effort",Coulter-Nile to Chris Morris,ONE
2969824,DC 1st Inns,18.5,"Coulter-Nile to Chris Morris, 1 run, Morris living a charmed life. Now, GG puts one down. What do you say now skipper? Umesh might be asking. It was a straightforward chance unlike his. Slower delivery and Morris is early into the drive, toe-ends it towards extra cover. It was going in slow motion and GG lost it in the background. The ball hit his fingers and went to ground",Coulter-Nile to Chris Morris,ONE
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,15.5,"Pat Cummins to M Pandey, 1 run, a fore-handed stroke to send this short ball to long-on. Manish Pandey notches up his fifty with that single",Pat Cummins to M Pandey,ONE

9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,16.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Vohra, 1 run, put down, put down! Dhawan seemed to have grabbed that for a split second, but no, it's down. Back of a length outside off, Vohra carves it off the back foot but he's hit it very close to sweeper cover. The ball was travelling though and Dhawan can't hang onto it as he was on the move",Bhuvneshwar to Vohra,ONE

1005940,DC 1st Inns,20.0,"S Kaul to Shreyas Iyer, 1 run, a tame flat-drive through cover to get to his fifty, but that won't help. 4/4 wins for SRH at home, yet again their bowling comes to the rescue. Superb death bowling",S Kaul to Shreyas Iyer,ONE
1005940,SRH 1st Inns,1.1,"Chris Morris to Warner, 1 run, direct hit would have made things interesting. Pitched up delivery outside off, Warner pushes to mid-off and sets off. He puts in a dive. But had Jayant Yadav found the target, Warner would have been a goner",Chris Morris to Warner,ONE
1005940,SRH 1st Inns,14.5,"Zaheer to Dhawan, 1 run, fifty for Dhawan. His first of the season. After a couple of 40s, he finally has a half-century to his name. That should bring back the confidence in him. Williamson walks up and congratulates him on the milestone. The knuckle ball which is short in length, Dhawan is early into the pull and lobs it off the edge to fine leg",Zaheer to Dhawan,ONE
3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,11.5,"Malinga to Amla, 1 run, slower and wider, Amla had to fetch, pings a single to cover to celebrate his fifty. Job half-done, his team-mates are a happy bunch in the dugout",Malinga to Amla,ONE

9478272,KKR 1st Inns,5.2,"Raina to Uthappa, 1 run, uppish, catchable but Finch lets it slip. A tough chance though. Maybe a swifter fielder would have easily had that. Shortish delivery on the stumps, Uthappa mistimes the pull, Finch didn't move quickly to his right from long-on, tried to grab the ball with his right hand but couldn't",Raina to Uthappa,ONE

3657322,RPS 1st Inns,12.2,"Siraj to Dhoni, 1 run, Tripathi had given up there. But backward point has just one stump to aim at and Vijay Shankar, who is on as a substitute, misses. Even wider than the previous ball and Dhoni has to really reach out for the cut. He mistimes it to the left of the fielder who turns around quickly after collecting and fires it in. Not great judgement from these two batsmen",Siraj to Dhoni,ONE
3657322,RPS 1st Inns,17.1,"Siraj to Dhoni, 1 run, just about carries to Bhuvneshwar but he cannot hold on. Pops out of his fingertips. A low full toss which is very wide of off and Dhoni squirts it right off the toe-end as he reaches out",Siraj to Dhoni,ONE

1169775,MI 1st Inns,4.5,"Zaheer to Nitish Rana, 1 run, subtle change of pace. Rana plays it late as he tucks it to short fine. A good throw from the fielder would have had Rana struggling at the non-striker's end",Zaheer to Nitish Rana,ONE
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,9.5,"Andrew Tye to Maxwell, 1 run, confusion but Amla survives. Nathu Singh from short fine leg failed to hit the target at the striker's end. Maxwell got across to flick this one straight to him. He got the ball, the batsmen in the meantime were staring dead into each other's eyes - standing in the middle of the pitch. Eventually decided to go for the run. And as luck would have it. Amla stayed",Andrew Tye to Maxwell,ONE
7614896,MI 1st Inns,12.5,"Stokes to Pollard, 1 run, oh a mix-up. Could have been a lot more. But for these missed aims. A polite knock to mid-wicket from Pollard and he just charges out to get away. Rohit meanwhile stands half way down the pitch hoping his partner would return. None of that happening though. And the Wankhede doesn't let sound travel, even across the pitch. Rohit has to thank a wayward throw",Stokes to Pollard,ONE

7614896,RPS 1st Inns,1.4,"McClenaghan to Tripathi, 1 run, direct hit at the striker's end and Rahane is in. The TV umpire was called for assistance. Easy one for him.

4947883,DC 1st Inns,8.5,"Russell to Prithvi Shaw, 1 run, Shaw had given up at the non-striker's end. Cummins, from mid-off, misses the stumps but he has hit Shaw right on the boot. He looks in some pain, but is back up quickly",Russell to Prithvi Shaw,ONE
4947883,KKR 1st Inns,1.5,"Nortje to Shubman Gill, 1 run, 149.6kph! Very full ball, Gill jams it out towards mid-off and sets off for a tight single. Iyer misses the target at the bowler's end. A direct hit would have been curtains for Gill",Nortje to Shubman Gill,ONE
4947883,KKR 1st Inns,11.5,"Stoinis to Nitish Rana, 1 run, slow, just outside off, and angling away. A quiet, neat run down to third man -- and fifty",Stoinis to Nitish Rana,ONE

9843066,SRH 1st Inns,12.0,"Bumrah to Warner, 1 run, 146.2kph, Bumrah tries to bowl a yorker and ends up bowling a low full toss. Warner push-drives down the pitch and the mid-off fielder dives to his left to stop it. The single also brings up Warner's fifty! Can he take his team over the winning line. Just 6 runs came off the over - SRH were happy to take the singles against Bumrah",Bumrah to Warner,ONE
9843066,SRH 1st Inns,14.0,"Pollard to Priyam Garg, 1 run, just 7 runs off the over. Overpitched delivery at 121.5kph, Garg gets under it and absolutely smashes it. Pollard is brave to stick his right hand out - over his head - and parry it towards the mid-wicket region. Too harsh to call it a drop...",Pollard to Priyam Garg,ONE

4491659,DC 1st Inns,15.0,"Navdeep Saini to Stoinis, 1 run, dropped! How costly a miss is this going to be? They dropped Rahul around the same time and we know what happened after. This was a full toss and Stoinis does not get it off the middle, heaves it towards deep mid-wicket where Chahal moves to his left and lets it slip through his hands. Moeen too was running across from long-on. Did that put him off?",Navdeep Saini to Stoinis,ONE
4491659,DC 1st Inns,15.4,"Siraj to Pant, 1 run, back of a length around off, Pant miscues the heave and the ball bounces just in front of long-on. The 50-run stand comes up between the duo and it has come in quick time",Siraj to Pant,ONE
4491659,DC 1st Inns,16.3,"Navdeep Saini to Stoinis, 1 run, run out chance missed. RCB making the same mistakes they made in their loss against KXIP. Low full toss outside off, Stoinis moves across and flicks it to the right of deep mid-wicket, he wanted the second and was halfway down, even given up since Pant didn't want it. But Kohli does not gather Padikkal's throw and that allows Stoinis to make his ground back",Navdeep Saini to Stoinis,ONE

3130666,MI 1st Inns,17.4,"Tom Curran to Hardik Pandya, 1 run, dropped! How costly will that be? Curran has no one else to blame than himself. The slower short ball outside off, Hardik tries to flat-bat it down town but the top-edge flies straight up to the right of the bowler, Curran sets himself up and lets it slip through his hands.
