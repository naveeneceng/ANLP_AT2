7898444,RPS 1st Inns,14.3,"Southee to Smith, 2 runs, fifty for Smith. This guy, huh, unbelievable. He comes off a 499-run series in Tests and now belts a half-century in his first IPL X innings. Clips a short of length off-cutter from outside off and rushes back for two",Southee to Smith,TWO
2373690,GL 1st Inns,13.3,"Chawla to Raina, 2 runs, in no man's land. The googly and Raina takes it on without reading, he charges down and goes across the line, the leading edge balloons up and drops in front of the incoming long-off fielder",Chawla to Raina,TWO
2373690,GL 1st Inns,15.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Raina, 2 runs, comedy of errors. First Raina gets away with yet another leading edge, goes on the bounce to long-on. He was never wanted the second and Karthik was almost near the bowler's end before Raina decided to go, Karthik makes it in and Kuldeep for some unknown reason doesn't throw it to Uthappa and Raina also survives. He's living a charmed life",Kuldeep Yadav to Raina,TWO
2373690,GL 1st Inns,5.5,"Woakes to Raina, 2 runs, that will go down as a chance, but Kuldeep did very well to get to the ball, got both hands and lost control as he fell down. Would have been a stunner had he held on. This was short and on the stumps, Raina was making room for the pull, gets slightly cramped on the shot, hits it high and over mid-on. Kuldeep ran a long way back, stretched as he got both hands to the ball - but can't complete the finishing act",Woakes to Raina,TWO
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,7.4,"Shadab Jakati to Gambhir, 2 runs, short ball on middle, Gambhir jumps on the back foot and lifts the pull over mid-wicket. 4th fastest team 100 in the history of IPL, gee!",Shadab Jakati to Gambhir,TWO
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,13.4,"Brathwaite to Kedar Jadhav, 2 runs, fifty for Kedar, this has been a superb innings, short and just outside off, he backed away and cut it to the left of point. Billings put in the dive, made the stop and fired in a throw at the striker's end, concedes another run",Brathwaite to Kedar Jadhav,TWO
9873957,MI 1st Inns,19.4,"Boult to Hardik Pandya, 2 runs, this is very, very ordinary from KKR in the field. The substitute Rishi Dhawan is the culprit this time. He drops a skier. Another brilliant short ball, rushes Hardik on the pull and takes a thick top-edge to deep square leg. Dhawan looks nervous under the ball, slips a bit and then has to dive to his left after the misjudgement. Makes a hash of it",Boult to Hardik Pandya,TWO
9873957,MI 1st Inns,6.1,"Narine to Buttler, 2 runs, the new opening combo for MI has registered a 50-run stand in only their second game together. Buttler works it away with the spin wide of long-on and the second was on",Narine to Buttler,TWO
8517839,RPS 1st Inns,15.3,"Basil Thampi to Ankit Sharma, 2 runs, back of a length slower ball on middle and leg, Ankit makes room and chops it into the pitch. He's ambling across for a single as Thampi appeared to be lazy in getting to the ball, but that's only a smokescreen. Thampi quickly pounces, turns and throws and would have caught Ankit short had he hit the stumps direct. Instead, concedes an extra run",Basil Thampi to Ankit Sharma,TWO
8517839,RPS 1st Inns,20.0,"Andrew Tye to Rahul Chahar, 2 runs, that could have, and should have, been four in the over for Tye. Another knuckle ball, Chahar is early into the slog and miscues it to Jadeja of all people at deep mid-wicket. He puts down a simple enough chance",Andrew Tye to Rahul Chahar,TWO
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,14.1,"Zaheer to Axar, 2 runs, Zaheer only had to gather that and Mohit was gone. But the throw landed very close to him making it difficult. Knuckle ball outside off, Patel punches it through backward point and calls his partner back for two despite the fielder swooping in quickly",Zaheer to Axar,TWO
2969824,DC 1st Inns,4.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Samson, 2 runs, to long on, 50-run stand in the fifth over. A gentle nudge into the leg-side, followed by a quick double",Kuldeep Yadav to Samson,TWO
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,14.0,"Henriques to Vohra, 2 runs, more than a dropped catch, that's two runs saved. A fine stretch from Nabi at short third man to get fingertips to the ball. Vohra wanted to ramp this back of length delivery above him, and was so nearly successful",Henriques to Vohra,TWO
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,10.4,"Cariappa to Warner, 2 runs, a calm looking pat through mid-wicket. And pulls his partner back for the second. Makes the dive as well as Maxwell charges in from the mid-wicket fence and misses with the direct hit. Had he hit, Ojha would've been gone",Cariappa to Warner,TWO
5231444,GL 1st Inns,18.0,"Head to Andrew Tye, 2 runs, dropped at long-on. Miscues it high and over but it's been dropped there. Fairly simple chance after Kohli runs across and gets the ball on his stuck out palm as well. Only for it to pop out",Head to Andrew Tye,TWO
5231444,RCB 1st Inns,14.1,"Shivil to Kohli, 2 runs, 28th IPL fifty for Kohli. Whips it wide of long-on and reaches the landmark",Shivil to Kohli,TWO
5231444,RCB 1st Inns,19.0,"Andrew Tye to Kedar Jadhav, 2 runs, dropped. Hard chance though since he was in his followthrough. Looked like the knuckle ball, Jadhav played it too early, gets a leading edge that popped back to Tye, who leapt with both hands outstretched. Can't cling onto the offering. Parries it towards long-off and they will steal a brace",Andrew Tye to Kedar Jadhav,TWO
1005940,SRH 1st Inns,12.0,"Mishra to Williamson, 2 runs, fifty for Williamson. First game and he's already making an impact. Whichever format it is just pleasing to watch KW bat. Moves away to the leg-side, reads the googly off the surface and works it in the gap in front of square on the leg-side, sprints back for the second and raises his bat to acknowledge the applause",Mishra to Williamson,TWO
3657322,RPS 1st Inns,4.1,"Siraj to Tripathi, 2 runs, Bipul has made a meal of a skier, he never settled himself under the ball, only manages to get his fingertips and lets the ball pop out. This was banged in short and on the stumps, Tripathi was looking to pull, gets a fat top-edge, high and behind square on the on-side. Bipul called for the catch, it kept swirling around, so did he and wasn't in any position in the end",Siraj to Tripathi,TWO
1169775,DC 1st Inns,19.3,"Hardik Pandya to Chris Morris, 2 runs, more of the same. Pandya persists with the line way outside off and Morris responds with another square drive. Uppish, whistling away off the turf. Just that this time Krunal is present in putting in the dive to keep it down to a couple. Meanwhile Morris has his fifty to boast of. He doesn't know. He doesn't care",Hardik Pandya to Chris Morris,TWO
7614896,RPS 1st Inns,11.4,"Karn Sharma to Smith, 2 runs, dropped! Harbhajan spills a sitter. That would have been a huge moment in the game. Tossed up on off, Smith not completely down on his knee to sweep, hence the ball lobs towards deep square leg. Harbhajan runs across to his left and goes with both hands, but manages to grass it. He was on the move and that made it difficult for him to control the ball. Karn is disappointed, he should have had his third",Karn Sharma to Smith,TWO
3554829,KKR 1st Inns,13.5,"Tahir to Gambhir, 2 runs, third umpire was called in but Gambhir has made it. Fifty for skipper. Yet another valuable knock from the skippy. His 100th game for KKR, all as skipper and he has again stepped up in a crucial game. The ball was cut away into the off-side and the throw came in at the striker's end to which Dhoni flicked it back onto the sticks. GG had made it easily",Tahir to Gambhir,TWO
1120275,GL 1st Inns,9.0,"Aniket Choudhary to Finch, 2 runs, fastest fifty by a GL player in the history of IPL, off 22 balls. Pitched up, Finch looks to drive firmly, it takes a big chunk of bottom half before dancing down towards the third man fence. A diving stop keeps it down to two, but cannot stop Finch from reaching fifty",Aniket Choudhary to Finch,TWO
4118946,DC 1st Inns,12.5,"de Grandhomme to Shreyas Iyer, 2 runs, pushes it away into the off-side for a quick single and a direct hit at the bowler's end would have seen the back of Shreyas Iyer but he survives as there was no direct hit and in the end, gets an extra run on the overthrow",de Grandhomme to Shreyas Iyer,TWO
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,17.1,"S Kaul to Axar, 2 runs, he's miscued that, but manages to place it to perfection in between long-on and long-off. Actually, Williamson got there from long-on with a one-handed effort but hardly managed to get fingers on the ball. A length ball which Axar wants to tonk down the ground, just couldn't get hold of it. Back for two",S Kaul to Axar,TWO
6727718,RCB 1st Inns,17.4,"Christian to Kohli, 2 runs, in the airrrr, just short of the fielder, Tiwary it was. Looks like he didn't see the ball at the last moment and it crashes into his knee",Christian to Kohli,TWO
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,11.0,"U Yadav to Warner, 2 runs, Davey Warner rushes for the second and there is that Mario jump from the little man. What a knock. It's a 43-ball 100. The helmet comes off and the arms are aloft in joy. A special effort indeed. He's single-handedly manhandled the visitors. This is an inswinging yorker on the leg stump, clipped to mid-wicket and he was quick to rush back for the second. Right then, can he beat Gayle's 175? If he carries on, he certainly can",U Yadav to Warner,TWO
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,3.5,"Y Pathan to Warner, 2 runs, change of angle and finally a ball in the fuller length, Warner tucks it through mid-wicket, a fumble and the third run was on, but Dhawan was not ball-watching",Y Pathan to Warner,TWO
4078176,MI 1st Inns,2.4,"Milne to Nitish Rana, 2 runs, uppish, Aniket is tested again and he comes second in the race. Lucky escape for Rana. This was a shortish delivery on the leg stump, Rana tried to work it on the on-side, got a leading edge that flew high, deep square leg and short fine leg tried to hunt, but the ball beat the outstretched arm of the latter",Milne to Nitish Rana,TWO
2608816,GL 1st Inns,6.3,"Shami to Raina, 2 runs, dropped. This is turning out to be the kind of knock he played against KKR very early in the tournament. This was in the slot for the batsman, Raina teed off with a slog, went at a catchable height to mid-wicket, although it was hit with power, Samules tried to grab it above his head but it popped out",Shami to Raina,TWO
2608816,GL 1st Inns,9.0,"Samuels to Raina, 2 runs, worked away off the back foot into the vacant mid-wicket region and that's a fifty for Raina, his 31st in the IPL. Pressure clearly back on Delhi, despite a dream start",Samuels to Raina,TWO
4825658,RPS 1st Inns,13.2,"S Kaul to Stokes, 2 runs, common-sense cricket from Stokes. Knocks it away into the leg-side and comes back for the second without breaking a sweat",S Kaul to Stokes,TWO
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,12.5,"Stokes to Yuvraj, 2 runs, direct hit and Yuvraj was struggling. Stokes sprays one down the leg-side from round the wicket, Yuvraj wanted to play his favourite pick-up shot over backward square, right off the cue-end and to deep mid-wicket, Unadkat get the angle and released the ball quickly. Dhoni also failed to collect the ball. Had he even deflected it onto the stumps, Yuvraj was a goner",Stokes to Yuvraj,TWO
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,14.5,"de Grandhomme to Mandeep, 2 runs, fifty for Mandeep. First of the season and he's repaid the faith shown in him. Raises his bat and soakes in the applause from the crowd. Nurdled in front of square leg and races back for the second. The running has been excellent from these two",de Grandhomme to Mandeep,TWO
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,18.4,"Woakes to Head, 2 runs, fifty for Head. It is his maiden IPL fifty for him. Good time to get it. The dugout are up on their feet applauding.

6360325,GL 1st Inns,16.4,"Aaron to Raina, 2 runs, that kind of a day it has been for Punjab. Gurkeerat misjudges this mistimed loft from Raina. Goes back, comes forward but is late by then, fails to get underneath the ball despite the dive from long-off. Got fingers to that, so will go down as a drop chance",Aaron to Raina,TWO
4724289,MI 1st Inns,4.2,"S Kaul to Parthiv Patel, 2 runs, dropped! Vijay Shankar the culprit. Could have been three down. Short and wide outside off stump, Parthiv cuts, doesn't bother to keep it down, went to backward point, the fielder jumped and got both hands to it, easily catchable but it burst through the hands",S Kaul to Parthiv Patel,TWO
2544566,DC 1st Inns,2.3,"D Kulkarni to Shreyas Iyer, 2 runs, back of a length just outside off, Iyer pats it to the left of Jadeja at backward point. They go through for a single. Jadeja shies at the stumps and concedes an overthrow. Replays show that Iyer had given up and had Jadeja hit, Iyer would've been gone",D Kulkarni to Shreyas Iyer,TWO
4550802,KXIP 1st Inns,15.1,"McClenaghan to Shaun Marsh, 2 runs, full toss but Shaun Marsh, in his bid to go too hard on the shot, mistimes it towards long-on. Is still wide of the fielder and fetches him a couple",McClenaghan to Shaun Marsh,TWO
6270193,DC 1st Inns,16.1,"Stokes to Pat Cummins, 2 runs, a direct hit and even Cummins' dive wouldn't have saved him. MS let the ball go and Cummins was sprawling all over the place. Coming to the ball, on a good length and just outside off, eased away backward of square on the off-side",Stokes to Pat Cummins,TWO
6270193,DC 1st Inns,19.4,"Unadkat to Shami, 2 runs, that's a chance and Sundar has dropped it, very similar to that of Unadkat's catch, this was another top-edge that went high and behind the keeper.

5641860,CSK 1st Inns,14.2,"Tom Curran to Billings, 2 runs, dropped! That should have been taken. Uthappa the culprit. Full and on the stumps, Billings makes room to go over mid-off, does not get the elevation and Uthappa does not time his jump near the edge of the circle. Parries it behind him and Rinku Singh from long-on tidies up",Tom Curran to Billings,TWO
5641860,CSK 1st Inns,16.0,"Narine to Billings, 2 runs, and Billings nudges one into the on-side ring, Dhoni was off in a flash and wanted two, he was cruising for the second when he saw the throw come to his end and decide to charge. Got it comfortably",Narine to Billings,TWO

True pitch, lovely stroke-maker, you got to expect him to come good and boy, he's done well in a stiff chase. Very full and outside off stump, Roy squeezes it out, straight to backward point and it goes right through him",Bumrah to Roy,TWO
1505006,DC 1st Inns,14.2,"Dananjaya to Roy, 2 runs, that's almost another catch. Delhi are going really hard and the opportunity for a wicket is always there. Need a bit of calmness out there. 50 odd 35 balls isn't that tough, especially at the Wankhede. Very full delivery, Roy slogs, connects well, luckily it dipped on SKY who was diving forward",Dananjaya to Roy,TWO
1505006,MI 1st Inns,15.1,"Christian to Ishan Kishan, 2 runs, short of length delivery angled in on middle, 116kph, thwacked through square leg on the front foot. They amble back for two",Christian to Ishan Kishan,TWO
1505006,MI 1st Inns,2.0,"Nadeem to Lewis, 2 runs, dropped by Trent Boult but geez that was a good attempt. Top-edge on the slog-sweep -- told ya that Nadeem was bowling slower in this over -- Boult runs back from backward square leg, doesn't get beneath the ball but doesn't stay put there. Rushes in front and stops the boundary. Top class athlete with a short term memory loss for good",Nadeem to Lewis,TWO
1505006,MI 1st Inns,9.4,"Maxwell to Suryakumar Yadav, 2 runs, now he's hanging the ball flat in the air. Full, worked to long-on and that's a half-century for Suryakumar Yadav off 29 balls. Second of his career. Wankhede crowd go berserk with the flags. Quite blue.",Maxwell to Suryakumar Yadav,TWO

2619288,KKR 1st Inns,14.4,"Shami to A Russell, 2 runs, fantastic work by Roy from long-on, but he can't get to the ball, in fact gets a fingertip on that on the dive forward.

4053491,KKR 1st Inns,13.0,"Andrew Tye to Chris Lynn, 2 runs, chance and Sran has dropped it. He did all the hard work, ran across to his left from deep cover, got both hands as he slid across, but fails to hold on. A life for Lynn, how costly will it prove to be? This was short of a good length and well outside off, Lynn threw his hands at that and carved it over cover, no real timing on the shot and it should have been gobbled up",Andrew Tye to Chris Lynn,TWO
4053491,KKR 1st Inns,14.0,"Mujeeb to Chris Lynn, 2 runs, slower and wider of off, Lynn went hard on the drive once again and mistimed it wide of long-off, that actually allowed the batsmen to come back for the second run",Mujeeb to Chris Lynn,TWO
7308498,MI 1st Inns,10.3,"Stokes to Suryakumar Yadav, 2 runs, oh, what a clanger. Krishnappa Gowtham, what have you done? Spills a straightforward catch at long-on. This is going to hurt RR, for sure. A slower ball from Stokes, Suryakumar took it on and miscued it completely. Gets it off the top half of the bat towards long-on. Gowtham had to move across a bit, went with both hands but it pops out of his hands. Tried grabbing it on the second attempt, in vain",Stokes to Suryakumar Yadav,TWO
