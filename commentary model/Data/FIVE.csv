3000439,KXIP 1st Inns,4.1,"Narine to Vohra, 5 wides, an inswinger from Narine. But this one goes a long way in the air, falls away down the leg-side and beats Uthappa completely. There's no stopping those runs",Narine to Vohra,FIVE
9886489,MI 1st Inns,4.5,"Siraj to Lewis, 5 wides, poor from Siraj and nothing much de Kock can do about the bad bounce. Tries the variation and it slips outside off, could say that the wide call was marginal but the uneven bounce means that de Kock couldn't get down in time. Races away to the fence",Siraj to Lewis,FIVE
7815415,KKR 1st Inns,0.5,"Chahar to Narine, 5 runs, direct hit would have taken out Narine! Rayudu the man at mid-on but he can't get it on target and what's worse, there is nobody backing up. Races away to the extra cover fence. Bonus runs for KKR. Was worked softly with a straightish bat but it was a risky run and Narine is lucky to survive",Chahar to Narine,FIVE
9969874,CSK 1st Inns,7.2,"K Paul to Watson, 5 wides, oh dear, tries the fast yorker and bowls down the leg-side, Pant can't cut if off. 50 up for CSK and they have got a solid start in the all important Qualifier game after struggling throughout the league phase. That's what experience does!",K Paul to Watson,FIVE
