4281444,RCB 1st Inns,15.0,"Rashid Khan to Watson, SIX, Rashid finishes with a long hop. To be fair, it's not abysmally short, but Watson is so good on the back foot. Rocks back quickly and hammers the pull over long-on",Rashid Khan to Watson,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,15.2,"Cutting to Binny, SIX, slower ball again but this time Binny hacks it over deep mid-wicket. It was slightly closer to off-stump and was given a fair tonk",Cutting to Binny,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,18.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Tymal Mills, SIX, full and wide, Mills has a proper dash at it and he's flayed it away over the point boundary. Magnificent hit. Bhuvneshwar won't enjoy that",Bhuvneshwar to Tymal Mills,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,19.3,"Cutting to Aniket Choudhary, SIX, first ball Choudhary faces in the IPL, he smashes it over long leg. A short ball from Cutting, Choudhary swings into an instinctive pull and gets enough on it",Cutting to Aniket Choudhary,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,3.0,"Nehra to Gayle, SIX, that ball hung in the night sky for eternity. Never looked like coming down. For what it's worth Gayle gets the maximum result. Length delivery right in the swinging zone and Gayle did not hold back, went full-monty and heaved it over deep mid-wicket. Six number one for Gayle in IPL 10",Nehra to Gayle,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,3.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, SIX, Gayle is in the mood. Mind you, he's not been in the best of forms, but IPL is his cup of tea. Bhuvneshwar dishes a full length delivery and hopes to get away with it, Gayle doesn't allow him to, carves it over long-on for his second maximum",Bhuvneshwar to Gayle,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,6.2,"Deepak Hooda to Gayle, SIX, a gift from Hooda and Gayle thumps it over the rope. A full toss outside off, Gayle takes a step out and slots it straight back over the bowler's head. Went miles back into the crowd",Deepak Hooda to Gayle,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,8.5,"Cutting to Kedar Jadhav, SIX, that looked like a half-hearted shot from Jadhav and it has travelled the distance. Picked the back of a length delivery and pulled it to the vacant deep mid-wicket region, just cleared the rope",Cutting to Kedar Jadhav,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,1.3,"Aniket Choudhary to Warner, SIX, .. and Warner makes the most of the free-hit. Another pretty poor ball from Choudhary, short and just outside off, Warner rocks back and pulls it high and over mid-wicket, went sailing into the stands for the first six of IPL 10",Aniket Choudhary to Warner,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,12.2,"Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj, SIX, whoa. This is getting back in the 2007 zone. Choudhary without a clue as to where to bowl goes full and wide. The mind-reader gets the front leg out and unleashes a full bat swing showing the maker's name in tonking it right on the extra cover ropes",Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,14.3,"Aravind to Yuvraj, SIX, into the first tier. And a standing admire from Yuvraj. Aravind serves a pie with the short sitter and heaved away. So very typical. Equally friendly bowling here as well",Aravind to Yuvraj,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,14.5,"Aravind to Henriques, SIX, now Henriques joins the act. Wants to ive his partner a run for his money. A run for some crowd catchers. Keeps banging it in short with the pitch sucking away all the momentum. Another mow across to give the crowd some work. Brings up his fifty. In some style",Aravind to Henriques,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,17.1,"Aniket Choudhary to Deepak Hooda, SIX, the march to the double ton gets another gear. And some help from Chahal in tipping it over the fence. Hooda opens up and uses his entire height to good effect in his tall pull. Mid-wicket takes another one in its kitty",Aniket Choudhary to Deepak Hooda,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,18.3,"Tymal Mills to Yuvraj, SIX, the murder continues. Mass murder. Another spirit buries itself inside this pitch. Overcompensates going short, going quick but the response is quicker. Is brutal too. Back to his high backlifted pulls. Gravity too cannot pull it down",Tymal Mills to Yuvraj,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,19.3,"Watson to Cutting, SIX, the yorkers too cannot stop the bleeding. Cutting rocks way inside, crouches, gets underneath the supposed yorker and carries on from the finals a year ago in tonking the drive",Watson to Cutting,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,20.0,"Watson to Cutting, SIX, a dramatic photo finish. Watson tries another short one but this time Cutting ain't surprised. Stands up, uses his entire height to good effect and smokes it away. Admiring it as he does so. As flat as the bat motion could get",Watson to Cutting,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,7.4,"Head to Henriques, SIX, massive, Henriques shimmies down the track, makes room as he did so and goes high and over long-on, went a long way into the stands. Watches in admiration as the ball kept going and going",Head to Henriques,SIX
7898444,MI 1st Inns,12.1,"Stokes to Nitish Rana, SIX, Stokes would be proud of that shot. Banged in halfway down and the line was around off, Rana is quick to transfer his weight onto the back foot and nails the pull over deep square leg. Third six that Stokes has conceded",Stokes to Nitish Rana,SIX
7898444,MI 1st Inns,16.5,"Tahir to Pollard, SIX, Tahir shouted ""catch it"" and there was no way anyone could have caught that. The South African goes a tad fuller in his length and that enables Pollard to get underneath it, slams it flat and over long-off for a maximum",Tahir to Pollard,SIX
7898444,MI 1st Inns,19.0,"Stokes to Southee, SIX, Southee nails this. He should have tried this shot on the previous ball.

7898444,MI 1st Inns,19.1,"Dinda to Hardik Pandya, SIX, consecutive sixes for MI. Dinda missed his yorker by a few inches and is launched into the crowd. Low full toss outside off, Pandya keeps a firm base and carves it over point. Went a long way back into the stands",Dinda to Hardik Pandya,SIX
7898444,MI 1st Inns,19.2,"Dinda to Hardik Pandya, SIX, Dinda attains normal services. Three sixes in a row. Pandya getting into the thick of things. Length delivery and Pandya dismisses it over long-off. Just stood there and dispatched it with disdain",Dinda to Hardik Pandya,SIX
7898444,MI 1st Inns,19.3,"Dinda to Hardik Pandya, SIX, make it four in a row. Dinda and death overs are not the best of mates. He goes full and misses the yorker by a couple of inches, Pandya had enough to get under that and smack it over long-on",Dinda to Hardik Pandya,SIX
7898444,MI 1st Inns,19.5,"Dinda to Hardik Pandya, SIX, Smith has a worried look as Pandya sends another one crashing over the rope. Switched to back of a length and the result remained the same, Pandya went back and nailed it over wide long-on. Pinged the ad hoarding on the full",Dinda to Hardik Pandya,SIX
7898444,MI 1st Inns,3.4,"Stokes to Buttler, SIX, for the first time this over, he pitches it up and Buttler goes bam! Gets underneath it and launches it for a maximum over long-on",Stokes to Buttler,SIX
7898444,MI 1st Inns,3.5,"Stokes to Buttler, SIX, Stokes turns back and smiles. That's all he could do. Ridiculous T20 batting on display. Buttler shuffles and scoops a pacy length ball over the keeper's head, lands just over the advertising triangles. Back to back sixes for Buttler",Stokes to Buttler,SIX
7898444,MI 1st Inns,5.5,"Chahar to Buttler, SIX, that's gone flying into the stands. Greyhounds out of his crease, picks the bones out of it, a Tennis-esque flat-batted smite over wide long-off",Chahar to Buttler,SIX
7898444,MI 1st Inns,8.3,"Zampa to Nitish Rana, SIX, half-tracker and gone! Lovely swivel-pull from Nitish Rana, lands Zampa over the mid-wicket fence, brute power!",Zampa to Nitish Rana,SIX
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,13.4,"Pollard to Smith, SIX, it's not working. Smith is just too good for Pollard. His slower balls do work sometimes but this is just different class. Smith picks it up, waits on it and swipes it over deep mid-wicket",Pollard to Smith,SIX
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,19.4,"Pollard to Smith, SIX, going, going, gone... Is there anything he can't do? It's a slower ball from Pollard, Smith swipes across the line and muscles it over wide long-on",Pollard to Smith,SIX
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,19.5,"Pollard to Smith, SIX, he's done it. A couple of sixes to finish the game off just when it was getting away from them. What a player! A full ball on leg stump, Smith whips it away with unbelievable timing over the deep mid-wicket boundary. Pune clinch the game with a ball to spare",Pollard to Smith,SIX
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,2.3,"Southee to Rahane, SIX, Rahane is looking in good touch, this was banged in short and on the stumps, Rahane swivels across, doesn't bother to keep it down. He didn't look in complete control - but has enough to send it sailing over the head of the man at long leg",Southee to Rahane,SIX
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,5.3,"McClenaghan to Rahane, SIX, that's easy pickings for Rahane, width on offer from McClenaghan. He stays in his crease, uses his hands to good effect, makes the most of McClenaghan's pace and helps it high and over third man for a maximum",McClenaghan to Rahane,SIX
7898444,RPS 1st Inns,9.2,"Krunal Pandya to Rahane, SIX, stunning bit of timing from Rahane and he gets just enough to beat Pollard's leap at long-on. At first instance, it looked like a simple dolly to long-on, the ball kept going and going. Pollard arched back one-handed, got a finger-tip, but the ball was always beating him",Krunal Pandya to Rahane,SIX
2373690,GL 1st Inns,17.0,"Chawla to Karthik, SIX, ends the over with a maximum. A much needed one for GL. Bit of air on this and a fuller length meant Karthik was able to get underneath that, he heaves it high and over the cow corner fence",Chawla to Karthik,SIX
2373690,GL 1st Inns,18.3,"Woakes to Karthik, SIX, Karthik picked the bones out of that. Length delivery right in the slot and it was a clean swing of the bat from Karthik, lofted it with a straight bat and cleared long-on with ease",Woakes to Karthik,SIX
2373690,GL 1st Inns,3.4,"Chawla to Brendon McCullum, SIX, massive, tossed up nicely by Chawla, fell right into McCullum's hitting zone, he gets forward and clubs it high and over mid-wicket, went a long way over the ropes",Chawla to Brendon McCullum,SIX
2373690,GL 1st Inns,7.0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Brendon McCullum, SIX, McCullum is in some form alright, comes down the track, doesn't get too close to the ball, allows him a free swing and he deposits it high and into the sightscreen. Another expensive over for the Knight Riders",Kuldeep Yadav to Brendon McCullum,SIX
2373690,GL 1st Inns,9.2,"Y Pathan to Finch, SIX, Finch gets going with a massive hit, Yusuf tosses one on the stumps, Finch gets a big stride forward, lifts it with the spin and sends it high and over deep mid-wicket for a maximum",Y Pathan to Finch,SIX
2373690,GL 1st Inns,9.3,"Y Pathan to Finch, SIX, back-to-back sixes from Finch, flighted delivery on the stumps, Finch gets forward and thumps it high and way over the fence at deep mid-wicket",Y Pathan to Finch,SIX
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,1.2,"D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn, SIX, that's the Chris Lynn we saw in BBL. Full-blooded swing, clears his front leg, picks the length early and goes bang over mid-wicket",D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn,SIX
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,13.1,"Shivil to Chris Lynn, SIX, way too many half-trackers from Shivil today. Just can't get away with it at this level. Lynn rocks back and blooters it over long-on",Shivil to Chris Lynn,SIX
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,14.1,"D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn, SIX, that about sums their night up. McCullum makes a blunder in the deep and palms the ball over the ropes. A miscue from Lynn off a full toss, should have been taken at long-off",D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn,SIX
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,14.3,"D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn, SIX, flat, strong, six! Kulkarni misses his mark, bowls it in the slot and is walloped over long-on. Lynn can do no wrong",D Kulkarni to Chris Lynn,SIX
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,2.4,"Gony to Chris Lynn, SIX, boy, has he nailed it! You bet. 95-metre smite. Gony serves length and gets smoked for a maximum over long-off",Gony to Chris Lynn,SIX
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,6.1,"Dwayne Smith to Chris Lynn, SIX, if that ball had voice, it would have pleaded: ""Chris please take me for a journey"". Lynn heard that and obliged, rubbish length ball outside off and the next thing Smith sees is the ball flying over deep mid-wicket",Dwayne Smith to Chris Lynn,SIX
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,6.4,"Dwayne Smith to Chris Lynn, SIX, in his zone and Lynn doesn't have any second thoughts. Marmalizes it with utter disdain, Roy came in the way to interrupt, he was never going to catch that. Never",Dwayne Smith to Chris Lynn,SIX
2373690,KKR 1st Inns,6.5,"Dwayne Smith to Chris Lynn, SIX, the onslaught continues... Full ball, don't even look back Mr Smith, the ball has gone to Brisbane. Period",Dwayne Smith to Chris Lynn,SIX
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,10.2,"Rahul Chahar to Axar, SIX, goes for the big whammy and succeeds. That was short and has been flat batted over long-on for a huge maximum. Pressure on the youngster",Rahul Chahar to Axar,SIX
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,12.1,"Rahul Chahar to Maxwell, SIX, MAAMMAAAMIAAAHH! The Big Show has arrived. The showman lays the bat on that and crunches that over the man at long-on. That scaled many a light years before coming down",Rahul Chahar to Maxwell,SIX
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,13.5,"R Bhatia to Miller, SIX, slower ball, doesn't matter. That was a dead meat of a delivery and the batsman has picked the bones out of that. It's that time of the season folks - In the arc, it's out of the park. If it's in the V, it's into the trees. Remember the carnage from 2013 against RCB?",R Bhatia to Miller,SIX
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,15.0,"Stokes to Maxwell, SIX, backs away by clearing his legs and then sees the ball like a football to have a clear swing at it. The ball soars over the long-off region for a maximum. Maxwell is taking it away",Stokes to Maxwell,SIX
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,15.2,"Tahir to Maxwell, SIX, 50 for the combo! That was a short ball, never got enough wood on it but enough on it to send it packing just over the man at mid-wicket. There were shouts of catch it but that region was unmanned",Tahir to Maxwell,SIX
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,15.3,"Tahir to Maxwell, SIX, the most powerful delivery boy is here. He has sent it packing over the cow corner region. Brutal sinews into that pull and the ball flies away into oblivion",Tahir to Maxwell,SIX
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,17.4,"Dinda to Miller, SIX, has that gone all the way? An overpitched delivery and the batsman checked his drive with power on his bottom hand to hit it flat and just past the diving Christian at long-on. The ball landed on the cushion and the third umpire signalled it as a half-a-dozen",Dinda to Miller,SIX
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,2.1,"Dinda to Vohra, SIX, that has been slapped! Short of a length delivery, Vohra dances down and wallops it over the bowler's head. Muscled it. Way past the boundary rope",Dinda to Vohra,SIX
2837493,KXIP 1st Inns,3.5,"Christian to Amla, SIX, Amla is turning it on here now! He walks down and lifts this shortish ball over mid-off. The ball has enough wings to go into the stands",Christian to Amla,SIX
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,10.0,"Swapnil Singh to Stokes, SIX, good end to the over. A massive end actually. In the arc of the southpaw and the batsman comes up with an explosive response to tonk the ball over the cow corner region",Swapnil Singh to Stokes,SIX
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,13.4,"Axar to Stokes, SIX, and now he lets the off-side take the brunt. Patel in his response fires one out flat and wide. The mind-reader that Stokes is, sinks and tonks it through the line",Axar to Stokes,SIX
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,14.4,"T Natarajan to Manoj Tiwary, SIX, the wide yorkers. Prove to be the undoing of Natarajan here. Makes Tiwary reach out making him stretch every cell of his body in getting there. Boy o boy he does. And how. Slices it imparting all the momentum in lofting it over backward point. These tiny boundaries I tell you",T Natarajan to Manoj Tiwary,SIX
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,15.2,"Stoinis to Stokes, SIX, he's smoking them in. With a gallop down, gets the ball sitting up in his arc and keeps swinging his bat. We are firmly into the baseball zone. Over cow corner",Stoinis to Stokes,SIX
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,18.2,"Mohit Sharma to Manoj Tiwary, SIX, in the arc, and out of the park. You cannot expect the bowler getting away bowling length at this stage. And Tiwary keeps up with the tradition of dishing out the punishments. Sits up and swings it through the line in tonking it over long-on",Mohit Sharma to Manoj Tiwary,SIX
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,19.4,"Sandeep Sharma to Christian, SIX, a switch to over the wicket makes no difference. Pounds it short, pounds it wide and Christian unleashes the mighty forehand smash. The concrete on the stands taking a real beating here",Sandeep Sharma to Christian,SIX
2837493,RPS 1st Inns,3.4,"Mohit Sharma to Rahane, SIX, OLLLLAALLLAAAA! That was some response from Rahane to a short ball. He loved the aroma on the perfume ball and accepted it with glee. That drop might well be costly",Mohit Sharma to Rahane,SIX
7088566,DC 1st Inns,11.3,"Watson to Pant, SIX, that's a really good short ball from Watson. Pant is unable to control the pull as he tries to fetch it over his head and nearly holes out. But these are short boundaries. The ball lobs up to the left of Binny at deep square leg, who runs backwards and leaps across but can only palm it over the ropes",Watson to Pant,SIX
7088566,DC 1st Inns,12.3,"I Abdulla to Pant, SIX, now he gets closer to off, Pant goes down on one knee and wallops it over wide long-on. This is superb batting from the 19-year old. He's putting Abdulla under tremendous pressure",I Abdulla to Pant,SIX
7088566,DC 1st Inns,18.0,"Tymal Mills to Pant, SIX, Rishabh Pant, you beauty! This is some stunning cricket we're witnessing here. He takes on the short ball, and pulls it away over the fine leg boundary. It was a thick top-edge there actually but with Mills's pace, it travelled",Tymal Mills to Pant,SIX
7088566,DC 1st Inns,6.5,"Chahal to Billings, SIX, oh my days! This is thrilling cricket. Billings goes down low and wallops the reverse-sweep for six. He's known for this. It was right in the slot too after Chahal flighted it up",Chahal to Billings,SIX
7088566,DC 1st Inns,7.5,"I Abdulla to Pant, SIX, holy smokes, the nerves these guys have got! First ball, Pant sashays down the track and wallops the ball over deep mid-wicket. He was playing with the turn, so not a bad option. But to do that first ball is something else. This is a roller-coster, this match",I Abdulla to Pant,SIX
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,12.2,"Mishra to Kedar Jadhav, SIX, massive, Kedar breaks the shackles, this was well tossed up on off, right into the swinging zone of Kedar, he gets forward and sends it high and into the second tier - over long-on",Mishra to Kedar Jadhav,SIX
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,13.0,"Mishra to Kedar Jadhav, SIX, 24 from the over. RCB needed something and Mishra has gifted them a perfect launching pad. Kedar is in some form alright. This was tossed up slower and wider outside off, Kedar bends down his knees and clubs it high and over long-on, went a long way over the ropes",Mishra to Kedar Jadhav,SIX
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,13.3,"Brathwaite to Kedar Jadhav, SIX, freaky, this is sensational from Kedar, length delivery on off, he makes room by backing away and goes inside out over cover, went all the way over the ropes",Brathwaite to Kedar Jadhav,SIX
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,16.0,"Brathwaite to Kedar Jadhav, SIX, cracking shot, he's in some devastating form at the moment - Kedar. Length delivery from Brathwaite, that's a cardinal sin for any bowler. Kedar gets his left leg out of the way and drills it back over the bowler's head, went high and into the top tier of the Chinnaswamy",Brathwaite to Kedar Jadhav,SIX
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,16.3,"Zaheer to Vishnu Vinod, SIX, he's done it several times for Kerala - he's showing why RCB picked him up as KL's replacement. Runs down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it over long-on for a maximum",Zaheer to Vishnu Vinod,SIX
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,19.2,"Chris Morris to Negi, SIX, Negi connects one finally! This was the slower full-toss from Morris, Negi backed away, got underneath the delivery and sends it soaring over long-off for a maximum",Chris Morris to Negi,SIX
7088566,RCB 1st Inns,7.4,"Mishra to Kedar Jadhav, SIX, beautifully played, what made the shot even more special was that he didn't get to the pitch of the ball. It only allowed him to free his arms and lift it inside out over cover, went sailing all the way",Mishra to Kedar Jadhav,SIX
7200146,GL 1st Inns,14.0,"Nehra to Dwayne Smith, SIX, Smith is finding his bearings now. Nehra errs in length and dishes out a full ball right in the hitting zone, Smith frees his arms and launches it straight down the ground, pings the sightscreen on the full",Nehra to Dwayne Smith,SIX
7200146,GL 1st Inns,18.4,"Cutting to Basil Thampi, SIX, this will do. Sinks low, gets under this slower ball and tonks it over the long-on fence for a maximum",Cutting to Basil Thampi,SIX
7200146,SRH 1st Inns,14.0,"Nehra to Dwayne Smith, SIX, Smith is finding his bearings now. Nehra errs in length and dishes out a full ball right in the hitting zone, Smith frees his arms and launches it straight down the ground, pings the sightscreen on the full",Nehra to Dwayne Smith,SIX

9873957,KKR 1st Inns,14.0,"McClenaghan to M Pandey, SIX, this was coming. With McClenaghan keeping it short and wide and Pandey's orthodox cuts failing, he decides to arch back with a toe-rise and ramps his bat upwards in teasing the man at third man over the ropes",McClenaghan to M Pandey,SIX
9873957,KKR 1st Inns,15.5,"Bumrah to M Pandey, SIX, oh boy. Smoked one down. For a change he stays put in his crease without moving around and bends low in plundering what should have been a yorker. A vicious bat swing in tonking it into the black screen",Bumrah to M Pandey,SIX
9873957,KKR 1st Inns,18.5,"Malinga to M Pandey, SIX, a sink, a swing and a crowd deposit. Picks out the predictable off-spinner and waits for the ball to get into his arc. Unleashes a full bat swing and goes through with it in holding the pose as he drills one several rows into the cow corner stands",Malinga to M Pandey,SIX
9873957,KKR 1st Inns,19.1,"McClenaghan to M Pandey, SIX, the sitting up length. Right where he wanted to and with all the pace on it as well for it to be dealt with severity. A full-blooded pull and just the sound ensures the maximum",McClenaghan to M Pandey,SIX
9873957,KKR 1st Inns,19.2,"McClenaghan to M Pandey, SIX, misses the mark yet again. A yorker attempted only to be missed by a cool few centimeters. Ample time for Pandey to settle himself under it as he hammers it over long-on. Just cannot keep it down",McClenaghan to M Pandey,SIX
9873957,KKR 1st Inns,3.4,"Malinga to Chris Lynn, SIX, there he goes! Loads up big, gets under this short ball and dismisses it into the deep mid-wicket stands. Into the top-tier",Malinga to Chris Lynn,SIX
9873957,MI 1st Inns,12.0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Nitish Rana, SIX, oh what a shot! 23 off the last two overs now. A good little burst from these two. Kuldeep still flights the ball up, the line is outside off and Rana goes through the line to cream it beautifully over extra-cover. What timing on that. Way into the stands",Kuldeep Yadav to Nitish Rana,SIX
9873957,MI 1st Inns,12.4,"Rajpoot to Pollard, SIX, all the way. If you're going short to Pollard, it better be nice and high. This one sits up around his chest and he dismisses it from his presence over the mid-wicket boundary",Rajpoot to Pollard,SIX
9873957,MI 1st Inns,17.4,"Boult to Nitish Rana, SIX, 10 off 2 balls. This game isn't over yet. Not while Rana is there. Boult is struggling to execute the yorker.

9873957,MI 1st Inns,18.0,"Boult to Hardik Pandya, SIX, length from Boult and it disappears way back over mid-wicket. The MI dugout is on its feet. What a blow from Pandya. But this is ordinary death bowling. Seam-up and good length, right there in the slot",Boult to Hardik Pandya,SIX
9873957,MI 1st Inns,18.1,"Rajpoot to Nitish Rana, SIX, lapped over the keeper for six! Thrilling stuff. Rana has stooped across and picked this full toss from middle-stump. It came right off the middle",Rajpoot to Nitish Rana,SIX
9873957,MI 1st Inns,18.5,"Rajpoot to Hardik Pandya, SIX, low full toss again and Hardik flogs it over square leg. He is 18 off 5. What a blinder!",Rajpoot to Hardik Pandya,SIX
9873957,MI 1st Inns,3.5,"Woakes to Buttler, SIX, Buttler clearly has the wood on his England team mates. Stokes in the first game and now Woakes. A little shuffle and a crouch down to scoop this length delivery over short fine. The connection was such that it travelled the distance",Woakes to Buttler,SIX
9873957,MI 1st Inns,6.4,"Narine to Buttler, SIX, Buttler surely picked that from Narine. It was the off-spinner and he played it with the turn, plants his foot across and whips it over the cow corner fence for a maximum. This was more timing than power from the Englishman",Narine to Buttler,SIX

2604889,KXIP 1st Inns,5.2,"Tymal Mills to Amla, SIX, in the airrrr and dropped. Mills is furious. Stanlake is the culprit. Don't even look at the bowler.

2604889,RCB 1st Inns,19.5,"Mohit Sharma to de Villiers, SIX, his body lost balance. He was done in by the length, which was full, done in by the lack of pace but he reached out for it. He still managed to drag the ball away over long-off and a six it is",Mohit Sharma to de Villiers,SIX
2604889,RCB 1st Inns,20.0,"Mohit Sharma to de Villiers, SIX, on the sticks, he goes down onto his knees and then the biggest of the night is unleashed as the ball scales some other orbit and disappears out of the stadium.

8351592,DC 1st Inns,6.0,"Mohit Sharma to Samson, SIX, caps off the over with a stinker. Short ball sat up nicely for Samson, he gets on top of it and nails the pull over wide long-on. Just about clears the fence",Mohit Sharma to Samson,SIX
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,11.0,"Mishra to Axar, SIX, gosh, that's big from Patel. Way back into the stands. Mishra turns one into him this time, Patel goes down quickly and picks the bones out of the slog-sweep. Elevation as well as the distance",Mishra to Axar,SIX
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,15.1,"Corey Anderson to Axar, SIX, drills this straight back down the ground. Anderson misses out on the blockhole by a few inches and is hammered by Patel. He's playing a good little knock here. But this chase is beyond his powers",Corey Anderson to Axar,SIX
8351592,KXIP 1st Inns,17.0,"Zaheer to Axar, SIX, another slower ball perhaps? Patel picks it up and nails it over long-on. He's been hitting them really well today",Zaheer to Axar,SIX
7374716,GL 1st Inns,12.5,"Bumrah to Brendon McCullum, SIX, a gift which McCullum accepts with pleasure. Full toss just below the waist, McCullum maintains a low base and helps it along the way, over long leg for a maximum",Bumrah to Brendon McCullum,SIX
7374716,GL 1st Inns,14.5,"Hardik Pandya to Karthik, SIX, 200th six this edition. And we are just into the 11th day. Improvisation at its best. Karthik moves across his stumps and gets underneath the back of a length delivery, uses the pace of Hardik and scoops it over the fine leg fence",Hardik Pandya to Karthik,SIX
7374716,GL 1st Inns,17.2,"McClenaghan to Karthik, SIX, he is a small man but when he hits them, he certainly packs a punch. Short of length delivery angled across off, Karthik goes deep inside the crease and pulls it over deep mid-wicket. Flat and all the way. 50-run stand and 150 up for GL",McClenaghan to Karthik,SIX
7374716,GL 1st Inns,19.0,"Malinga to Roy, SIX, why was Roy held back? Can someone tell me? Such power and timing he possesses. This was more power and the ball cleared Pollard with ease. Malinga misses the yorker length and Roy gets under that, though a miscue the ball still goes over long-on with ease. A rare off-day for Malinga, finishes with: 4-0-51-1",Malinga to Roy,SIX
7374716,GL 1st Inns,5.2,"Malinga to Brendon McCullum, SIX, wow! He made that look easy. McCullum waltzes down and Malinga shortens his length. But there was enough width outside off for McCullum his free his arms. He expertly elevates over the point region and it has enough wings to go all the way",Malinga to Brendon McCullum,SIX
7374716,GL 1st Inns,5.4,"Malinga to Brendon McCullum, SIX, shot! It's the slower ball from Malinga and McCullum picks the bones out of it. Waits for it to come to him and muscles it over mid-wicket. Second maximum of the over",Malinga to Brendon McCullum,SIX
7374716,MI 1st Inns,13.4,"Munaf Patel to Pollard, SIX, 120kph slower short of length delivery, sat up nicely for Pollard, who pulls it off the front foot, struck it flat and over the wide long-on fence",Munaf Patel to Pollard,SIX
7374716,MI 1st Inns,14.4,"Dwayne Smith to Pollard, SIX, just a lift and off it goes over the long-on fence. For the first time in the over Smith pitches it up, Pollard nonchalantly puts it over long-on. Just an extension of the arm and the ball flew away",Dwayne Smith to Pollard,SIX
7374716,MI 1st Inns,15.5,"Jadeja to Rohit, SIX, lovely shot! This is Rohit Sharma we all know. Flighted on off, he makes a bit of room to go inside out and connects handsomely, the ball crosses the boundary cushion by a metre or so",Jadeja to Rohit,SIX
7374716,MI 1st Inns,16.3,"Andrew Tye to Pollard, SIX, just over a leaping McCullum at long-off. Short of length delivery outside off, Pollard flat-bats it straight back over Tye, McCullum standing at straightish long-off, jumps up and couldn't even get a finger",Andrew Tye to Pollard,SIX
7374716,MI 1st Inns,4.2,"Basil Thampi to Buttler, SIX, wow! That's a Buttler special. Easily done. Short of a good length delivery on off, Buttler moves across, still has the eyes on the ball and scoops it over the keeper's head. Improvisation at its best",Basil Thampi to Buttler,SIX
7374716,MI 1st Inns,4.5,"Basil Thampi to Nitish Rana, SIX, shot! That's Raina-esque. Slower ball outside off. Overpitched as well, Rana crouches low and creams the lofted cover drive over extra cover. It came right off the sweet portion of the bat and the ball goes the distance",Basil Thampi to Nitish Rana,SIX
7374716,MI 1st Inns,5.5,"Andrew Tye to Nitish Rana, SIX, one of the best shots of the day! Short ball at a decent pace, Rana has no trouble in pulling it over square leg for a maximum. He absolutely middled it",Andrew Tye to Nitish Rana,SIX
7374716,MI 1st Inns,9.0,"Jadeja to Buttler, SIX, wow! 15 runs off the over and MI are surely ahead at this stage. Right in the slot for Buttler to swing his bat. He prods forward and thumps it over long-on for a huge six",Jadeja to Buttler,SIX
9515142,RCB 1st Inns,0.3,"Unadkat to Kohli, SIX, my word, how well has he timed that! Unadkat appeared to have deceived Kohli with a cutter and Kohli had to really reach out for it. But his wristwork is a work of genius. He somehow manages to whip the ball away over the deep square leg boundary. Fantastic shot",Unadkat to Kohli,SIX
9515142,RCB 1st Inns,16.5,"Christian to Binny, SIX, Binny nails this one into the crowd. The slower ball from Christian drifted into his hips, sat up to be put away, and Binny flogged it a long way over long leg. Don't think we're getting the ball back. Someone's taking it home. Ball change required",Christian to Binny,SIX
9515142,RCB 1st Inns,17.2,"SN Thakur to Negi, SIX, well, well .. don't go anywhere. This partnership has raced away to 22 off 9. Thakur deviates from the slower ball strategy, bowls it full and wide of off and Negi spanks him over mid-off. That's gone all the way. Flat six",SN Thakur to Negi,SIX
9515142,RCB 1st Inns,3.0,"Unadkat to de Villiers, SIX, he's hit that straight into the stage where a display car is kept. He sat on that slower ball. It was a touch on the shorter side, AB is quick to rock back before mowing it over wide long-on",Unadkat to de Villiers,SIX
9515142,RCB 1st Inns,8.4,"Tahir to de Villiers, SIX, Tahir flights it up and AB immediately clatters him over long-off. Just got the length wrong there. It was a bit too full outside off. Still, it's a superb shot as AB had to reach out",Tahir to de Villiers,SIX
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,14.0,"Chahal to Dhoni, SIX, whoa. The beast mode is out. And the ball has been tonked into one of the metros going around. Dhoni is back to his earlier avatar of galloping down to spinners and just swings the bat keeping it as straight as possible. Laced over long-on. Has to be the biggest of this season",Chahal to Dhoni,SIX
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,19.0,"Watson to Manoj Tiwary, SIX, even better. The gorgeousness of the shots increases in an arithmatic progression. Much straighter this from Watson but once again off a generous half volley length. A seam up and dispatched into the sight screen with a full flowing drive",Watson to Manoj Tiwary,SIX
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,19.5,"Milne to Manoj Tiwary, SIX, up and dispatched. Gives his side something to bowl at on this graveyard. Milne after bowling an eviable yorker misses the next. A cool few inches short and enough time for Tiwary to get under it in whipping it over the top. Behind square and into the stands",Milne to Manoj Tiwary,SIX
9515142,RPS 1st Inns,3.2,"Aravind to Tripathi, SIX, nothing streaky this time. Aravind looks for another one to fox the batsman getting too predictable in the process. A mighty swing taking the ball into the clouds before getting it to settle over long-on. Jee, this target setting is getting scary",Aravind to Tripathi,SIX
2969824,DC 1st Inns,15.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Pant, SIX, wow! Floated up outside off, Pant had the width to free his arms and he made no mistake, lofts it high and over the long-off fence. Almost nailed the electronic scoreboard",Kuldeep Yadav to Pant,SIX
2969824,DC 1st Inns,16.2,"U Yadav to Pant, SIX, the yorker gone wrong. Low full toss just outside off, Pant brings that strong bottom hand into play, gets underneath it and sends it sailing over the long-on fence. What a hit!",U Yadav to Pant,SIX
2969824,DC 1st Inns,16.4,"U Yadav to Pant, SIX, 16 off three balls. That is what he can do. Length delivery on the pads, Pant crouches low and plays the pick-up shot to perfection, sent it packing over backward square leg",U Yadav to Pant,SIX
2969824,DC 1st Inns,16.5,"U Yadav to Pant, SIX, wasn't Umesh the best pacer for India in the Test season? He's been taken to the cleaners by the youngster. Third six in the over and already 22 off the over. KKR will be hurting by this onslaught. Fuller and around off, Pant clears his front leg and dispatched it over wide long-on",U Yadav to Pant,SIX
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,12.2,"Mathews to M Pandey, SIX, that's a pressure-releaser. Jogs down the track and uses his wrists to good effect. Flicks it handsomely over square leg. there were two men in the deep. All they could do was watch it sail over the rope",Mathews to M Pandey,SIX
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,13.4,"Zaheer to Y Pathan, SIX, can't get away with this full toss! Pathan brings up his fifty in style. He clears his front leg and swings his bat hard. Finds the gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket and has enough power to go all the way as well",Zaheer to Y Pathan,SIX
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,19.4,"Mishra to M Pandey, SIX, wow! Six and KKR need just 2 now. It was darted outside off. Pandey does a Dhoni! He moves slightly across and thumps it over long-on. Cummins was coming forward and I reckon he misjudged it there. Had he held his ground, he might have had a better chance",Mishra to M Pandey,SIX
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,8.0,"Shami to Y Pathan, SIX, how on earth did it go over the ropes? Shami looks flabbergasted. Almost did in with this off-pace delivery, Pathan was months early into the shot, ends up mistiming it but such is his power that it went all the way for a maximum over deep mid-wicket. Pathan ended up hitting that with the use of one hand as the bottom hand came off",Shami to Y Pathan,SIX
2969824,KKR 1st Inns,8.3,"Mishra to M Pandey, SIX, fabulous shot. Uses his feet, reaches the pitch and tonks one over long-on. Went sailing into the stands",Mishra to M Pandey,SIX
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,14.1,"Barinder to Mohit Sharma, SIX, Mohit Sharma, what a strike! Never mind my comment that they have no real firepower to come. This has been caned over point. Full and wide from Sran, Mohit clatters it away",Barinder to Mohit Sharma,SIX
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,14.3,"Barinder to Vohra, SIX, two sixes in three balls. The required rate is back under 12. Handsome strike from Vohra, crunching the full ball over long-on to bring up his half-century",Barinder to Vohra,SIX
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,15.4,"Rashid Khan to Vohra, SIX, short again, this time it's all the way. It might have been a googly, but it's way too short. Vohra nails the pull over long leg",Rashid Khan to Vohra,SIX
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,15.5,"Rashid Khan to Vohra, SIX, what a stunning hit over long-on. Vohra is playing an absolute blinder here to spring the game back to life. A flighted leg-break on off, Vohra doesn't bother using his feet. Just a stride forward to smash it through the line",Rashid Khan to Vohra,SIX
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,17.1,"S Kaul to Vohra, SIX, he's not mis-hit one delivery, not that I can remember. What we're watching is something very special. A length ball wide of off, this is actually a pretty decent delivery. But Vohra's arc has widened so humongously tonight that he's able to fetch it over long-on. Just over the fielder",S Kaul to Vohra,SIX
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,4.1,"Nabi to Eoin Morgan, SIX, bowls it short first ball and Morgan is quick to pump him over long-on. Swiftly jumps onto the back foot and thumps a flat pull over the ropes",Nabi to Eoin Morgan,SIX
9296666,KXIP 1st Inns,5.5,"Rashid Khan to Vohra, SIX, oh my goodness, the sound that made! Wow. Rashid flights the leg-break up around off, Vohra quickly goes down on the back knee and belts a slog-sweep into the second tier over mid-wicket",Rashid Khan to Vohra,SIX
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,13.5,"Axar to Naman Ojha, SIX, whoa. Take that. A gallop down the track, inherits the ball right in the slot and just swings the bat all along. A massive swing and lofts it over deep mid-wicket. Several rows inside",Axar to Naman Ojha,SIX
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,19.4,"Sandeep Sharma to Warner, SIX, bursts through the hands. Oh Morgan. Such has been the standard set these days that you expect these to be picked out. A low full toss here and Warner reaches out on a knee, almost rolls over in the process too. But imparts the final few breaths of energy in him to loft it over long-off, where Morgan gets his hands up but in the quest of keeping himself inside the rope lets the ball sneak through",Sandeep Sharma to Warner,SIX
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,20.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Rashid Khan, SIX, that's how it is done. A banged in sitter and Rashid just stands tall and slogs. Connects right with the middle of his sweet spot and in the only ball he faces gets the ball into the crowds. Over long-on. 159 is what the Sunrisers manage",Sandeep Sharma to Rashid Khan,SIX
9296666,SRH 1st Inns,9.0,"Cariappa to Warner, SIX, the usual suspect. To deal with the mystery spin. Warner pre-plans his switch. Gets quickly the other way and fetches this off the middle stick to slog-sweep it away over point",Cariappa to Warner,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,13.0,"Milne to Brendon McCullum, SIX, Milne is letting it through like a sieve here. Very full ball. Too full, Milne. And McCullum makes room and hedgehops him flat over his head. 39 off Milne's 3 overs so far",Milne to Brendon McCullum,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,13.4,"Watson to Brendon McCullum, SIX, here's it, again. A big front foot stride that somehow opens the leg-side for this man. Hacks the ball across and popped it away over square leg. Scratch that. Not popped, but bruted",Watson to Brendon McCullum,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,17.0,"Aravind to Ishan Kishan, SIX, uh oh. I will. I have. Kishan gets a six here.

5231444,GL 1st Inns,17.2,"Head to Ishan Kishan, SIX, I-am-from-McCullum's-team slog sweep. Sits low, gets under this hospitably full ball and punishes it. Admonishes it",Head to Ishan Kishan,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,18.4,"Aravind to Ishan Kishan, SIX, eish! This guy! It's a full toss alright but look at that bat swing. Brutal. Swings this full toss over deep mid-wicket. Way over. 32 off 8 needed..",Aravind to Ishan Kishan,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,19.0,"Aravind to Ishan Kishan, SIX, 26 needed off the last over now. I'm not calling this, yet. Another slower delivery on the shorter side, Kishan ducks but only to get under it and hoicks it up and over backward square leg",Aravind to Ishan Kishan,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,2.2,"Aravind to Raina, SIX, hoisted. And with sheer timing. A slider this from Aravind onto the pads further amplified by a shuffling across Raina, who picks and posts it over the long leg ropes",Aravind to Raina,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,2.3,"Aravind to Raina, SIX, just when we assumed the earlier flick was good, this one gets even better. Plonks his front leg forward to a pitched up delivery right in the slot and keeps the bat face full in lofting it with all the elegance. Down the ground",Aravind to Raina,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,3.1,"Chahal to Brendon McCullum, SIX, the slog mode is on. Oh it better be. Is quickly on a knee with the bat turning into a slogging monster as he swings across the line and goes high and mighty into the cow corner stands",Chahal to Brendon McCullum,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,4.1,"Negi to Brendon McCullum, SIX, moves well across the stumps. And is down on a knee. To execute some more of his slogs. An angry sweep in the air and a dispatch into the stands behind square",Negi to Brendon McCullum,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,5.3,"Chahal to Finch, SIX, brings the hoick out. The defence was meant only for the first delivery. Spots the googly and decides to let the mid-wicket ropes take the brunt of the hammer once again. Tantalizingly over the fingers of a leaping man right at the fence",Chahal to Finch,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,7.4,"Watson to Brendon McCullum, SIX, oh the bats. And the muscles. Helped by Watson's want to bowl length and he just gives himself some room in swinging his bat as he lofts it high and mighty down the ground",Watson to Brendon McCullum,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,8.3,"Milne to Brendon McCullum, SIX, nothing mistimed about this one. Hands with a speed greater than 3 x 10^8 as he unleashes a ferocious cut to a short one in slapping it over extra cover. All the way as well",Milne to Brendon McCullum,SIX
5231444,GL 1st Inns,9.2,"Negi to Brendon McCullum, SIX, 10 years down. And McCullum puts up another show. Against the very same opponents. A real drag down and pulls out the agricultural heave in pocketing a half-century with a max over his favoured square leg",Negi to Brendon McCullum,SIX
5231444,RCB 1st Inns,10.3,"Dwayne Smith to Gayle, SIX, he eats, sleeps and churns out sixes like a mill. Right in the slot for Gayle, he won't spare those. Just muscles it flat-batted over long-on",Dwayne Smith to Gayle,SIX

5231444,RCB 1st Inns,6.5,"Shivil to Gayle, SIX, there you go! Overpitched and Gayle latches onto it. Presses forward and dispatches it over long-off for a huge six. Just an extension of his off-drive. Brings up the 50-run stand as well",Shivil to Gayle,SIX

5231444,RCB 1st Inns,8.0,"Jadeja to Gayle, SIX, Jadeja gets his man. But, this wicket should belong to McCullum. Hang on! It was a low full toss outside off. Gayle stays in his crease and doesn't get hold of his lofted drive over extra cover. B-Mac at long-off runs to his right and takes a flying one-handed catch. The Lions are confident. The umpires want to go upstairs. Soft signal is Out. Oh wait, did his floppy hat make contact with the rope? Oh, yeah. What a shame! Baz's brim of the hat saves Chris Gayle. The southpaw has a big smile on his face as he comes back. He gets six runs as well. Even, Kohli came and shook hands with the SUPERMAN to applaud his effort. Credit to McCullum for he immediately gestured that his hat may have touched the hoarding. Felt the touching motion",Jadeja to Gayle,SIX
5231444,RCB 1st Inns,9.3,"Shivil to Gayle, SIX, stand and deliver. That's a 104 meter six! Gets to his fifty in a grand style. Right in the slot for Gayle to swing his bat.

1005940,DC 1st Inns,4.1,"Siraj to Samson, SIX, another nonchalant strike over long-on! He makes it look ridiculously easy. The key is that Samson's head is so still while hitting through the line. Once the ball is full, he simply gets a small stride in, keeps his balance, and plays an extension of the on-drive",Siraj to Samson,SIX
1005940,DC 1st Inns,8.0,"Henriques to Nair, SIX, brilliant shot on the move. He's walking down the pitch, Henriques does him in length with an off-cutter but Nair is still able to loft him through the line over mid-off.

1005940,SRH 1st Inns,13.3,"Mishra to Williamson, SIX, even the tallest man in the team can't get a finger on that. Tossed up around off, Williamson makes room and drags the loft towards long-on.

1005940,SRH 1st Inns,13.5,"Mishra to Williamson, SIX, how is he not playing every game? He's turning it on here for SRH.

3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,19.2,"Malinga to Amla, SIX. First T20 hundred for Hashim Amla. What.A.Player. He posts a leg-side rubbish into the fine leg stands with a clean wallop. Sigh!",Malinga to Amla,SIX
3632467,KXIP 1st Inns,4.2,"Malinga to Amla, SIX, wowww! It's always interesting to see Amla play aggressive cricket. This was an authoritative hit. Malinga seemed surprise by that approach. He bowled a normal back of a length delivery, but Amla had made up his mind to go big, went back in the crease and launched it over long-on for the first maximum of the day",Malinga to Amla,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,1.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Buttler, SIX, easy as! That's just a flick off the wrists and the ball has flown away over mid-wicket. A little shimmy down the pitch from Buttler to get close to the ball, picks it away with sumptuous timing. He's been lukewarm so far in the IPL. Can tonight be the night?",Sandeep Sharma to Buttler,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,10.1,"Ishant to Nitish Rana, SIX, we're into the mode of having fun now. A wide yorker gone wrong. Shortened by a few inches and Rana just leans low, crouches and whacks it down the ground",Ishant to Nitish Rana,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,11.1,"Swapnil Singh to Nitish Rana, SIX, right in the slot. Talk of the pressure of a chase. Mumbai do not seem to understand though. Sinks, buries and slogs it into the night sky. Rows into the cow corner stands",Swapnil Singh to Nitish Rana,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,11.2,"Swapnil Singh to Nitish Rana, SIX, the misery is piled on. This time with the length getting even more horrific. In the form of a rank drag down. A rock back, a swivel and a dispatch off a flat batted mow into the mid-wicket stands",Swapnil Singh to Nitish Rana,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,12.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Buttler, SIX, whoa. Brute. Angry. These bottom hands. These big bats. All in one. Clears his front leg getting it out of the way does Buttler, gets under the friendly length delivery and just jabs it over long-off. The flattest you'd have seen",Sandeep Sharma to Buttler,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,12.4,"Sandeep Sharma to Buttler, SIX, a miscue? Does it matter? It continues to fly. More of the sitters from Sandeep enabling Buttler to get on top of the bounce and he just clobbers it over cow corner. The required run-rate is a mockery now",Sandeep Sharma to Buttler,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,14.1,"Ishant to Nitish Rana, SIX, 180-degrees on the other side from the one he'd intended to go over. But the maximums only keep coming. Gets the ball to climb up awkwardly does Ishant getting it up on the ribs and Rana just swings his bat looking to go over cow corner again with the familiar hits. Gets the familiar result though with the top-edge flying over the cordon. And his third half-century of this season too",Ishant to Nitish Rana,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,14.4,"Ishant to Hardik Pandya, SIX, another bat. Another rocket launcher. The angry flat bat face is up and so is the usage in whacking it. Boom. Back into the third stand. Over mid-wicket",Ishant to Hardik Pandya,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,15.3,"Mohit Sharma to Nitish Rana, SIX, that's that. A real mockery this. A target of almost 200 and Mumbai do it with time to spare to go after another. Mohit meanwhile bends his back in banging it half way down the track and Rana just swivels as he hooks it into the second floor. Over long leg",Mohit Sharma to Nitish Rana,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,3.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Buttler, SIX, oh my! KXIP won't be liking this. They don't want to run into Buttler on the wrong night. And so far, the signs are ominous. Buttler exposes his stumps again, backs away, and smokes a low full toss over extra-cover. Flat six",Sandeep Sharma to Buttler,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,3.1,"Ishant to Parthiv Patel, SIX, good length ball on leg stump, Parthiv whips it gloriously into the fine leg stands. What a pick up! The runs are flowing for Mumbai",Ishant to Parthiv Patel,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,5.1,"Stoinis to Parthiv Patel, SIX, backs away, Stoinis bangs it in, and Parthiv spanks him off the front foot well in front of square. That's gone all the way. It's just flying off their bats. Amazing timing",Stoinis to Parthiv Patel,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,7.1,"Stoinis to Nitish Rana, SIX, any confirmation needed about what form Rana has been in? Have a look at this. He's pulled that into the stands, making it look so easy. Short of length over leg-stump, that's usually a very awkward line. But Rana's so quick to get outside the line of it and then helps it on its way over fine leg",Stoinis to Nitish Rana,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,8.3,"Axar to Nitish Rana, SIX, Axar fires this well outside off and would have hoped that he's got this out of Rana's reach. But Rana is still able to fetch the slog-sweep comfortably over wide long-on. Amazing shot",Axar to Nitish Rana,SIX
3632467,MI 1st Inns,8.5,"Axar to Buttler, SIX, that's almost a seam-up delivery from Axar, but he's landed it way too short and Buttler parks him into the crowd. He uses the depth of the crease well and pulls it over mid-wicket",Axar to Buttler,SIX
9478272,GL 1st Inns,1.5,"Narine to Finch, SIX, wow! The intention is clear from both batsmen. Slightly overpitched, Finch gets low and smacks the slog sweep over deep mid-wicket. There was a man in the deep, but he couldn't do anything",Narine to Finch,SIX
9478272,GL 1st Inns,14.1,"U Yadav to Raina, SIX, picks the slower ball and deposits into the crowd. An off-cutter from Yadav, Raina backs away and nails the slog sweep from a length. Sailing over mid-wicket",U Yadav to Raina,SIX
9478272,GL 1st Inns,15.5,"Narine to Jadeja, SIX, top-edged .. and taken by Surya at long-on. But he's stepped on the boundary cushion. Straightaway signals a six, making it easy for the umpire. A desperate move from Jadeja after three dot balls, he nearly falters but somehow the top-edge flies right at the edge of the boundary, where Surya does really well having stationed himself just inside the ropes. But his weight is leaning back as he stretches overhead and the momentum takes him over",Narine to Jadeja,SIX
9478272,GL 1st Inns,16.4,"Coulter-Nile to Raina, SIX, slower ball this time, and all the way. He's tearing into Coulter-Nile here. Picks up the change of pace right off the hand and whips the ball off middle and leg into the deep mid-wicket stands",Coulter-Nile to Raina,SIX
9478272,GL 1st Inns,17.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Raina, SIX, quickly onto his back knee to smoke a slog-sweep over mid-wicket. He sees the ball drifting into leg, it's in the slot and Raina gets under it beautifully. Just 8 needed now",Kuldeep Yadav to Raina,SIX
9478272,GL 1st Inns,3.0,"Shakib to Finch, SIX, second six for Finch and GL are off to a flier. Waits for this slingy ball to come to him and dispatches it into the long-on stands. 15 runs off the over",Shakib to Finch,SIX
9478272,GL 1st Inns,3.5,"Coulter-Nile to Brendon McCullum, SIX, 50 up for GL in 23 balls! Head-high bouncer, McCullum isn't perplexed by that. He is on the front foot to pummel the pull well in front of square on the leg-side. The deep mid-wicket fielder is just a spectator",Coulter-Nile to Brendon McCullum,SIX
9478272,GL 1st Inns,8.2,"Woakes to Raina, SIX, just grazes Pathan's fingertips at fine leg. Hooks a short ball and wasn't quite in control of it, it loops up and goes flat to the right of fine leg who sprints with his right hand stretched to the maximum. Just can't get there",Woakes to Raina,SIX
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,10.1,"D Kulkarni to Uthappa, SIX, Uthappa is the best front foot puller. Picks the back of a length delivery early, just plonks his foot forward and short-arm jabs the pull over cow corner. Flat and all the way",D Kulkarni to Uthappa,SIX
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,17.2,"Basil Thampi to Uthappa, SIX, 10 off the first two balls. The back of the hand slower one does not come out right for Thampi, ends up as a nice juicy full toss for Uthappa, who heaves it into the crowd at deep mid-wicket",Basil Thampi to Uthappa,SIX
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,2.5,"Basil Thampi to Narine, SIX, gee, this is the shot of the match so far. Could well be the shot of the day. Highest score for Narine in T20s. Thampi bowls a length delivery on the leg stump, Narine goes leg-side and lofts the drive easily over mid-off and holds the pose for the cameras",Basil Thampi to Narine,SIX
9478272,KKR 1st Inns,8.3,"Jadeja to Gambhir, SIX, that's easy pickings for Gambhir. Full and outside off stump, the ball is turning back in, so the mid-wicket area is a favourite zone for a left-hander, Gambhir swings with the spin and sends this all the way - the first six for him this season",Jadeja to Gambhir,SIX
3657322,RPS 1st Inns,14.4,"S Kaul to Dhoni, SIX, that's as flat a six as they come. Never got over 10 feet above the ground. Lots of power in the bottom hand as Dhoni swipes an overpitched delivery over wide long-on. Not easy to get under those",S Kaul to Dhoni,SIX
3657322,RPS 1st Inns,17.4,"Siraj to Dhoni, SIX, he's muscled that over the long-on boundary. Nothing but brute power. It's a decent ball from Siraj: a leg-cutter wide of off. But Dhoni swings his hips, pumps his arms and flat-bats it away",Siraj to Dhoni,SIX
3657322,RPS 1st Inns,18.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Dhoni, SIX, hit hard, hit flat, six! Dhoni, you have been missed. That's sensational ball-striking. It's very full from Bhuvneshwar, most players won't be able to get under it but Dhoni's wrists and the power he generates are something else. A Dhoni special",Bhuvneshwar to Dhoni,SIX
3657322,RPS 1st Inns,4.2,"Siraj to Tripathi, SIX, cracking shot, banged in short and on the stumps, Tripathi was waiting on it, swivels across and pulls it high and over square leg, no need to run for those",Siraj to Tripathi,SIX
3657322,RPS 1st Inns,5.3,"S Kaul to Tripathi, SIX, beautifully played, Tripathi is making SRH suffer for dropping him, runs down the track, driven on the up - played with the full face of the bat, a high elbow and deep into the stands at long-on",S Kaul to Tripathi,SIX
3657322,RPS 1st Inns,6.0,"S Kaul to Tripathi, SIX, for a moment, it looked like it went straight up in the air.. but Tripathi has managed to clear the fielder at deep point. This was full and wide of off, he lost his grip on the hand as he went chasing after it, ended up slicing it high and over cover. The fielder in the deep thought he had a chance, but ended watching it sail over his head. It was the slower ball from Kaul, thought he had done the batsman in by his clever change of pace",S Kaul to Tripathi,SIX
3657322,RPS 1st Inns,9.4,"Bipul Sharma to Smith, SIX, massive, that ruins the over for Bipul, too full and just outside off, Smith bends down low and slogs it high and over mid-wicket, went sailing into the crowd",Bipul Sharma to Smith,SIX
3657322,RPS 1st Inns,9.5,"Bipul Sharma to Smith, SIX, Smith is ruining Bipul's figures here, slower and just outside off, Smith gets forward and thumps it high and wide of long-on, has the power to sail over the ropes, back-to-back sixes for Smith",Bipul Sharma to Smith,SIX
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,11.3,"Stokes to Williamson, SIX, top-edge and six, no luck for Stokes today. Banged in short and on the stumps, Williamson was late on the pull, gets a fat top-edge that sails high and into the stands at long leg",Stokes to Williamson,SIX
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,14.3,"Tahir to Warner, no ball, SIX, that should break the shackles for SRH and Warner, this was a high full-toss from Tahir, Warner was already pre-meditating the reverse sweep, ends up playing the switch hit and sends it high and over deep point for a maximum",Tahir to Warner,SIX
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,16.1,"Unadkat to Henriques, SIX, SRH need many more of these, length delivery outside off, that's right in his hitting zone, clears his left leg and clouts it high and over mid-wicket for a maximum",Unadkat to Henriques,SIX
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,18.3,"Unadkat to Deepak Hooda, SIX, massive, Unadkat misses his mark, offers a length delivery on the stumps, Hooda gets underneath it and sends it high and over long-on, hits the roof of the second tier and bounces back into the ground",Unadkat to Deepak Hooda,SIX
3657322,SRH 1st Inns,18.5,"Unadkat to Henriques, SIX, cracking shot, this was the slower short ball from Unadkat, Henriques spotted it early, waited on it and slaps it high and over deep mid-wicket, went a long way into the stands. SRH are finishing well here",Unadkat to Henriques,SIX
1169775,DC 1st Inns,18.0,"McClenaghan to Chris Morris, SIX, much needed. Courtesy Morris. Walks across, stands tall and gives the sitting up short one a real spank in getting it to fly over mid-wicket",McClenaghan to Chris Morris,SIX
1169775,DC 1st Inns,9.4,"Harbhajan to Rabada, SIX, a dance and a dispatch. Right up, close and personal to a friendly tosser up and excutes the lofted drive. Clears the tallest man on operation at long-off",Harbhajan to Rabada,SIX
1169775,MI 1st Inns,1.4,"Chris Morris to Buttler, SIX. Bouncer. Top-edge. Six! Are you surprised? Oh! The bats these days. Big chunk of edge as Morris drops his head in disappointment. Went for the pull did Jos Buttler and Morris' pace took care of the rest",Chris Morris to Buttler,SIX
1169775,MI 1st Inns,16.1,"Chris Morris to Hardik Pandya, SIX, for a second the ball seemed to be heading out of Wankhede. But just clears the rope. Slower delivery on middle and leg, Pandya clears his front leg and heaves it to deep mid-wicket. Not off the middle and hence didn't go a long way",Chris Morris to Hardik Pandya,SIX
1169775,MI 1st Inns,18.2,"Rabada to Hardik Pandya, SIX, smoked! Back of a length delivery, Pandya was almost cramped for space, but got a decent connection on the short-arm pull, the ball travels to second tier at the deep mid-wicket fence. Head right on top of the ball was the key there",Rabada to Hardik Pandya,SIX
1169775,MI 1st Inns,3.2,"Rabada to Buttler, SIX, you don't bowl length to this lad. Not when he's in form. Clears his front leg and smokes it with superb ease over mid-wicket",Rabada to Buttler,SIX
7139797,GL 1st Inns,14.3,"Axar to Andrew Tye, SIX, they need more of these! Andrew Tye goes across the line, the ball did not turn and came in with the arm, helping Andrew Tye's swing. Goes well over the cow corner",Axar to Andrew Tye,SIX
7139797,GL 1st Inns,4.0,"T Natarajan to Finch, SIX, that spoils the over for Natarajan. It was good until then, but ends up conceding 11. Good length ball just outside off, Finch extends those big forearms and smashes it over long-off",T Natarajan to Finch,SIX
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,11.1,"Basil Thampi to Maxwell, SIX, Maxwell is much better off playing conventional cricket shots. Short delivery and at Thampi's pace it sat up for the Australian, who dismisses it with a pull over deep mid-wicket",Basil Thampi to Maxwell,SIX
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,13.2,"Shubham Agarwal to Maxwell, SIX, mammoth! Agarwal is brave enough to toss it up to Maxwell, who plonks his front foot forward and muscles the loft over the bowler's head. Cleared the sightscreen with ease. All bottom hand!",Shubham Agarwal to Maxwell,SIX
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,13.4,"Shubham Agarwal to Maxwell, SIX, this is buffet for Maxwell. Couple of steps down and takes it on the full, then heaves it a long way over the cow corner fence. Second six of the over and Agarwal is under pressure",Shubham Agarwal to Maxwell,SIX
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,18.1,"Dwayne Smith to Axar, SIX, first ball and it is out of the park. Length delivery right in the slot, Axar crouches a bit and tonks it over deep mid-wicket. Plenty of height and the required distance",Dwayne Smith to Axar,SIX
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,18.3,"Dwayne Smith to Axar, SIX, Doctor Smith changes to round the wicket but there is no respite for him. Proving to be a costly injury that to Nathu Singh.

7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,19.5,"Basil Thampi to Saha, SIX, this time Thampi does not get away with a full toss. There's the big hit Saha was looking for, heaves it towards cow corner and has made a decent connection for the ball to carry over the fence",Basil Thampi to Saha,SIX
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,5.5,"Andrew Tye to Amla, SIX, as long as they fetch runs - mistimed swing again. Gets over the man at long-on; made a bit of room to this length ball and threw whatever he had. Will be happy with the end result for sure",Andrew Tye to Amla,SIX
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,7.2,"Shubham Agarwal to Shaun Marsh, SIX, mishit. Again. Won't use that famous thing..everytime. Yeah. Shaun Marsh skips down the track and lofts over the man at long-off. Eventually it has enough on it",Shubham Agarwal to Shaun Marsh,SIX
7139797,KXIP 1st Inns,8.4,"Jadeja to Amla, SIX, there's no reason for Jadeja to flight and be full. Because one time he tries this, he gets lofted over deep extra cover.. inside out. Goes all the way",Jadeja to Amla,SIX
6991308,KKR 1st Inns,0.5,"Badree to Narine, SIX, lovely, Narine's toying with Badree, comes down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it high and over long-on, 18 runs already from the over",Badree to Narine,SIX

7614896,MI 1st Inns,11.3,"Tahir to Karn Sharma, SIX, and he piles it on with a salt rub. Gets a ball in the slot at a good length and just swings his bat out. Tonking it down the ground",Tahir to Karn Sharma,SIX
7614896,MI 1st Inns,13.3,"Tahir to Rohit, SIX, well if there is someone catching this it is in the crowds. That's into the railway line. Into one of the Virar locals perhaps. Another variation, in the form of a googly this time and picked out right off the palm as he slogs it while sweeping",Tahir to Rohit,SIX
7614896,MI 1st Inns,15.2,"SN Thakur to Rohit, SIX, Rohit and his front footed pulls. Ah, sublime. Thakur looks to pepper it with banging it half way down and watches it being deposited with a flat bat into the first floor over deep square leg",SN Thakur to Rohit,SIX
7614896,MI 1st Inns,19.2,"Unadkat to Rohit, SIX, it only gets another twist. Spoke too soon. Converts a wide length ball into one in the arc with a run across his stumps. And then it is his swing that takes over. Hacks it across the line and despite the top-edge the big bats ensure it flies into the stands over mid-wicket",Unadkat to Rohit,SIX
7614896,MI 1st Inns,20.0,"Unadkat to Harbhajan, SIX, he finishes it with a swat. In style. But it is Pune who'll be celebrating. They've breached the fortress.

7614896,RPS 1st Inns,1.0,"Johnson to Rahane, SIX, what a wonderful shot! Shows the nature of the track. An away-slanter from a good length, Rahane squats, reaches for it and slaps it over cover. Off the middle and the ball has enough wings to go all the way",Johnson to Rahane,SIX
7614896,RPS 1st Inns,5.1,"Karn Sharma to Tripathi, SIX, that's a monster! Dhoni-esque. Flat, quick and overpitched, right in the slot for Tripathi to swing his bat. Clears his front leg and tonks it over long-on for a gigantic six",Karn Sharma to Tripathi,SIX
7614896,RPS 1st Inns,9.5,"Karn Sharma to Tripathi, SIX, good effort from the man in the deep, but he couldn't stop it from going into the fence. A 68-metre six. A leg-break, Tripathi gets down and slog sweeps. Doesn't quite get it off the middle of the bat. Nitish Rana at deep mid-wicket waits for it at the edge of the rope. But, the ball had just about enough elevation to go over him",Karn Sharma to Tripathi,SIX
3554829,KKR 1st Inns,11.0,"Christian to Uthappa, SIX, some salt into the open wounds being garnished in by Uthappa. The ball was short but Uthappa was tall enough to smack the pull away over cow corner. He wants a quick finish",Christian to Uthappa,SIX
3554829,KKR 1st Inns,13.4,"Tahir to Gambhir, SIX, looked like a mishit but that has gone for a half-a-dozen. The ball was in his zone and the batsman played the cross batted swipe to tonk the ball away over deep mid-wicket",Tahir to Gambhir,SIX
3554829,KKR 1st Inns,15.4,"Tahir to Uthappa, SIX, onto one knee! The story after that is scripted. The author - Uthappa just looks into the stands. The ball has disappeared into the stands at the cow corner region",Tahir to Uthappa,SIX
3554829,KKR 1st Inns,15.5,"Tahir to Uthappa, SIX, this one is a sequel to the previous six. Meatier and bigger. He knelt down and clobbered the slog sweep deep into the stands. That should be six and a half, Danny would agree for sure",Tahir to Uthappa,SIX

3554829,KKR 1st Inns,8.3,"Tahir to Uthappa, SIX, had a good piece of that did Robin Uthappa. Got underneath and marmalized a floater over long-on for a 83-metre maximum over long-on",Tahir to Uthappa,SIX
3554829,RPS 1st Inns,14.4,"Chawla to Dhoni, SIX, you put fielders close to me, I will hit the ball out of the park. Dhoni is taking the aggressive option. This time gets right under the ball after dancing down, smokes it straight back over Chawla for a maximum",Chawla to Dhoni,SIX
3554829,RPS 1st Inns,15.5,"Kuldeep Yadav to Dhoni, SIX, chants of ""Dhoni, Dhoni"". He's looking in ominous touch here. Not all that short from Kuldeep, Dhoni went deep in the crease and might have top edged the pull, looked mistiemd at first, but the ball kept gathering momentum as it flew over the deep mid-wicket fence",Kuldeep Yadav to Dhoni,SIX
3554829,RPS 1st Inns,18.5,"Woakes to Christian, SIX, super shot! Woakes was a bit predictable there. Full and wide outside off, Christian lined up for the loft over extra cover and nailed it to perfection. All the way and a much needed one for RPS",Woakes to Christian,SIX
3554829,RPS 1st Inns,19.0,"Woakes to Christian, SIX, back-to-back sixes and now we know why GG was relcutant to bowl the spinners at the death. Length delivery right in the swinging arc, Christian is known for his big-hittin and he thumps this over the cow corner fence",Woakes to Christian,SIX
3554829,RPS 1st Inns,19.1,"U Yadav to Smith, SIX, 16 balls without a boundary or a six, now RPS have three on the trot. This is a top shot. A difficult one to play. Wide yorker outside off, Smith opens the bat face and carves it over point. Nice connection and pinged the ad boardings",U Yadav to Smith,SIX
3554829,RPS 1st Inns,4.3,"Woakes to Rahane, SIX, Rahane breaks the shackles, at first look - he didn't looked to have timed it, but it kept soaring high and into the stands at long-on.

1120275,GL 1st Inns,10.4,"Negi to Finch, SIX, that's been launched! Full in the slot for Finch and he isn't standing on ceremony there. He certainly isn't. Lots of flight from Negi, Finch's eyes lit up. Huge six down the ground",Negi to Finch,SIX
1120275,GL 1st Inns,10.5,"Negi to Finch, SIX, that's a smaller six but perhaps a better shot as he had to drag it from outside off. So much power in the bottom hand as he swipes a flat six over wide long-on",Negi to Finch,SIX
1120275,GL 1st Inns,12.4,"Negi to Raina, SIX, races to the pitch of the ball and lofts it over wide long-on. Raina may have the net run-rate at the corner of his eye",Negi to Raina,SIX

1120275,GL 1st Inns,4.4,"Badree to Finch, SIX. Kaboom. Make that two in a row. Finch wants to take the attack to the opposition. This time he fetches the ball from leg stump and goes spank over wide long-on. Madness...",Badree to Finch,SIX
1120275,GL 1st Inns,7.2,"Chahal to Finch, SIX, down the wicket and bam! Was nowhere near the pitch of the delivery, but fast hands and power of Finch takes care of everything. No half-measures. Swung it as hard as he can and got it over mid-wicket",Chahal to Finch,SIX
1120275,GL 1st Inns,8.5,"Aniket Choudhary to Finch, SIX, how does it matter? He is smashing the ball into the crowds. A half-volley on the pads, he whups it for a 97-metre maximum over mid-wicket.

1120275,RCB 1st Inns,1.5,"Basil Thampi to Kohli, SIX, there goes the riposte from the RCB skipper. He planted his feet leg-sidish and created enough room for a whip of the hands. The ball soared into the stands",Basil Thampi to Kohli,SIX
1120275,RCB 1st Inns,13.1,"Ankit Soni to Negi, SIX, a much needed six. Soni is brave enough to toss it up, Negi kneels down and fetches the slog sweep from outside off, smacks it over long-on and has the crowd going again",Ankit Soni to Negi,SIX
1120275,RCB 1st Inns,13.3,"Ankit Soni to Negi, SIX, Soni is trying too many things. First ball - leggie. Second - googly. Third - the front of the hand slider, Negi flat-bats it over extra cover. Just about has enough wings to clear the rope",Ankit Soni to Negi,SIX
1120275,RCB 1st Inns,7.5,"Ankit Soni to Kedar Jadhav, SIX, drops down on one knee and sends the ball skywards. That was a maximum, the moment it left the bat. He pumelled that with all his might and the ball landed well into the crowds in the cow corner region",Ankit Soni to Kedar Jadhav,SIX
4118946,DC 1st Inns,11.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Samson, SIX, well tossed up delivery and the batsman slog sweeps it out of the park. That brings fifty for Samson! This has been a fine knock from the keeper-batsman. This might as well break the shackles",Kuldeep Yadav to Samson,SIX
4118946,DC 1st Inns,12.4,"de Grandhomme to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, short delivery, sans any pace and the batsman hammers the pull away over the man at deep mid-wicket for a sixer. Iyer has changed gears as well",de Grandhomme to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
4118946,DC 1st Inns,13.5,"U Yadav to Samson, SIX, Bang!! Boom!! Short ball and the batsman transfers his weight ever so slightly to thwack the ball over the on-side towards cow corner region for a huge six. That was almost lost in the clouds",U Yadav to Samson,SIX
4118946,DC 1st Inns,2.0,"U Yadav to Samson, SIX, cracking shot, fraction too short from Umesh, Samson is quick to swivel across, uses the pace on the ball and helps it on its way, went sailing over the ropes at backward square leg",U Yadav to Samson,SIX
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,11.4,"Mishra to Uthappa, SIX, picks the bones out of this googly from Mishra. It was tossed up generously and as soon as Uthappa picked it, he decided it was going in the stands. Heaves it way over long-on. It was right in the slot too",Mishra to Uthappa,SIX
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,7.1,"Chris Morris to Uthappa, SIX, sharp short delivery and Uthappa is up for the challenge. He gets into position quickly and nails the pull behind square, flat and all the way. Good start to the over",Chris Morris to Uthappa,SIX
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,7.3,"Chris Morris to Uthappa, SIX, 16 runs off the first three balls. This is the best of the lot. Good length ball on the pads, Uthappa just picks it up nonchalantly and places it into the stands at deep mid-wicket",Chris Morris to Uthappa,SIX
4118946,KKR 1st Inns,8.1,"Pat Cummins to Uthappa, SIX, he promised some fireworks this year and he's keeping up his words. Anticipated the length to be short, got quickly into position and smashed the pull over the deep mid-wicket fence",Pat Cummins to Uthappa,SIX
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,1.3,"Nehra to Guptill, SIX, short ball at 131ks, angled into the body. Bring it on says Guptill as he swivel-pulls a 77 metre maximum over square leg.",Nehra to Guptill,SIX
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,12.1,"Henriques to Eoin Morgan, SIX, fetches the length ball and then thwacks the ball over long-on. Length in the later part of the innings spells doom for the bowlers",Henriques to Eoin Morgan,SIX
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,14.3,"S Kaul to Shaun Marsh, SIX, WOOAAAAHHHHHH! That was out of the top draw! A length ball it was and the batsman cracked it over covers for a maximum. That should have been awarded a dozen runs just for the execution of it",S Kaul to Shaun Marsh,SIX
8703679,KXIP 1st Inns,5.3,"Deepak Hooda to Shaun Marsh, SIX, cracking shot, just a little shimmy down the track, Marsh gets close to the pitch of the ball, extends his elbows and lifts it high and over long-off, went a long way into the stands",Deepak Hooda to Shaun Marsh,SIX

8703679,SRH 1st Inns,2.2,"Ishant to Dhawan, SIX, wow!! Dhawan is up and running. Similar line from Ishant. Dhawan won't miss out this time. Swings hard and connects well to deposit it into the fine leg stands. A huge hit from Dhawan",Ishant to Dhawan,SIX

6727718,RCB 1st Inns,16.3,"Tahir to Kohli, SIX, that's a googly too short and Kohli thrashes it. Shortish delivery and down the leg-side, sits up nicely, Kohli sends that over the mid-wicket boundary. Fifty up",Tahir to Kohli,SIX
6727718,RPS 1st Inns,11.3,"Badree to Smith, SIX, looked a bit fidgety last over, but boy he has nailed this out of the screws. Underneath a flat delivery and he goes spank over mid-wicket",Badree to Smith,SIX
6727718,RPS 1st Inns,12.2,"Chahal to Manoj Tiwary, SIX, that's the shot of the game for me. Lovely use of the feet, comes dancing down towards the pitch of the ball and bulldozes it into the mid-wicket stands. Tonk!",Chahal to Manoj Tiwary,SIX
6727718,RPS 1st Inns,17.3,"Aravind to Dhoni, SIX, the 400th six of the tournament and it has come from MS. No fuss, just a touch outside his crease, picks the bones out of a half-volley and golf-swings it straight down the ground for a 80-plus metre maximum",Aravind to Dhoni,SIX
6727718,RPS 1st Inns,4.1,"Aravind to Tripathi, SIX, wow! Welcome to Pune says Tripathi to Aravind. Pitched up delivery on middle and leg, Tripathi sinks down on one knee and slogs it away over long-on",Aravind to Tripathi,SIX
1229540,GL 1st Inns,1.3,"Malinga to Ishan Kishan, SIX, full, on the sticks and Kaboom! That tailed in ever so faintly and Ishan Kishan goes into overdrive mode. That was tonked over deep mid-wicket as the whirlwind of the hands took it high and handsome over the ropes",Malinga to Ishan Kishan,SIX
1229540,GL 1st Inns,17.4,"McClenaghan to Andrew Tye, SIX, short ball, Tye was ready for it. Is quick to stamp his weight onto the back foot and murders the pull over square leg",McClenaghan to Andrew Tye,SIX
1229540,GL 1st Inns,17.5,"McClenaghan to Andrew Tye, SIX, slower ball, he has picked it again does Andrew Tye. Not quite off the middle, but he will take it, a 83-metre maximum. Doesn't make any shuffly movements, just keeps his head still and spanks the ball as hard as he can, into the long-off stands",McClenaghan to Andrew Tye,SIX
1229540,GL 1st Inns,2.1,"McClenaghan to Ishan Kishan, SIX, OOLLLLLAAAAALLLAA! That was a sizzler. Dropped short and the batsman camps back and pulls the ball away into the deep mid-wicket stands. That was powered, muscled and I can go on...",McClenaghan to Ishan Kishan,SIX
1229540,GL 1st Inns,20.0,"McClenaghan to Ankit Soni, SIX, perfect finish for the Lions, but Mumbai Indians will be the happier side. Ankit Soni gets underneath this half-volley and blazes it over long-off. Clean ball-striking!",McClenaghan to Ankit Soni,SIX
1229540,GL 1st Inns,8.4,"Krunal Pandya to Jadeja, SIX, he has his intentions clear! That has been swiped clean as a whistle. Knelt down and swept it big for a maximum",Krunal Pandya to Jadeja,SIX
1229540,MI 1st Inns,19.1,"Irfan Pathan to Krunal Pandya, SIX, that should seal it! Full and in the zone and the batsman whistled the ball away into thin air for a maximum straight down the ground. That was a poor delivery, they should have opted for Jadeja",Irfan Pathan to Krunal Pandya,SIX
1229540,MI 1st Inns,2.3,"Irfan Pathan to Parthiv Patel, SIX, even better! Short ball that sits up nicely for Parthiv to play the pull shot. He is a short man, but isn't afraid to play shots like that. Pummels it over deep mid-wicket",Irfan Pathan to Parthiv Patel,SIX
1229540,MI 1st Inns,4.4,"Raina to Nitish Rana, SIX, this guy is a positive batsman. What a wonderful way to get off the mark. Sinks low on one knee and smacks the slog sweep over deep backward square leg",Raina to Nitish Rana,SIX
9007667,DC 1st Inns,11.0,"Axar to Corey Anderson, SIX, lovely shot, much needed blow for the Daredevils - but they need plenty of thse more. Came down the track, doesn't get too close to the ball, allows him to free his arms - plays with the turn and deposits the ball way into the stands at long-on",Axar to Corey Anderson,SIX
9007667,DC 1st Inns,4.4,"Sandeep Sharma to Nair, SIX, cracking shot, banged in short and just outside off, Karun was early into the pull and nailed it high and in front of square on the on-side, went soaring over the ropes for a maximum",Sandeep Sharma to Nair,SIX
9007667,KXIP 1st Inns,4.3,"Chris Morris to Guptill, SIX, Guptill is in overdrive. Wants to capitalise on the powerplay. Stays a bit leg-sidish, loads up big time and smacks it with lot of power to send it soaring into the long-on stands",Chris Morris to Guptill,SIX
9007667,KXIP 1st Inns,6.1,"Mishra to Guptill, SIX, he is greeted to the crease with a maximum. Slips in a googly, on a shortish length, Guptill picks it up and clubs it way back into the mid-wicket stands",Mishra to Guptill,SIX
9007667,KXIP 1st Inns,7.3,"Nadeem to Guptill, SIX, wow. Massive strike from Guptill. Bends low on seeing this tossed up, gets into good position and smokes it over deep mid-wicket. Scores are level now",Nadeem to Guptill,SIX
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,11.1,"Henriques to Uthappa, SIX, goodness gracious. Spots the bowler rolling his fingers across and delays his slog over mid-wicket, bruting the ball way over for a maximum",Henriques to Uthappa,SIX
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,11.4,"Henriques to Uthappa, SIX, that's a half-baked bouncer. At half the pace it should have been, so the shortish length is all too easy to deal with. Uthappa clubs it over cow corner with utter disdain. Gets to his fifty, another one this season",Henriques to Uthappa,SIX
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,17.4,"Siraj to de Grandhomme, SIX, nah. Drops it short, de Grandhomme looked ready and hammers the pull into the stands. Way over the ropes. Lovely, lovely hit",Siraj to de Grandhomme,SIX
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,6.1,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, SIX, if one shot could be included in the wikipedia page of 'power', this is it. 101 metres from Uthappa. Slogs across the line and puts a lot of flesh on it to send it over the deep mid-wicket fence. Was hit with the turn, yes a googly it was",Rashid Khan to Uthappa,SIX
7420225,KKR 1st Inns,8.1,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, SIX, this is the second time Uthappa has slogged across the line off Rashid Khan. And like the previous occasion makes good connection again, sending it deep into the stands at deep mid-wicket",Rashid Khan to Uthappa,SIX
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,1.3,"U Yadav to Warner, SIX, that's just just missed the sightscreen. This is a good batting surface to hit through the line. You can't bowl full if it's not swinging, Warner bends his knees and gets under it, smashed over mid-off. First maximum of the night",U Yadav to Warner,SIX
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,10.0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Warner, SIX, wowww! This is some hitting. Spare a thought for the bowler. Kuldeep bowled a full delivery looking for some spin, Warner gets down on one knee and slogs it over long-on",Kuldeep Yadav to Warner,SIX
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,2.2,"Woakes to Warner, SIX, the skipper wants to make it big today. Such a lovely shot this. English length from Woakes. Sits up nicely, on a good length and on the stumps, this is a batting belter, at least with the new ball, so the bowler's got to be clever. Warner gets inside the line and just picks it up to send it over the long leg boundary",Woakes to Warner,SIX
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,3.0,"Woakes to Dhawan, SIX, now then, now then! That was a shot to make a statement. National selectors, please note. How hard did he hit that? Walked slightly across the line, expectedly got the slower ball and muscled that over the mid-wicket boundary. How poor was Woakes to opt for a slower ball for the fourth successive time?",Woakes to Dhawan,SIX
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,3.4,"Y Pathan to Warner, SIX, this has gone all the way over the mid-wicket boundary. The bowler needs to show a bit of courage here and not just bowl short all the time. Got to fancy his chances too. Warner slogs and the connection is very good",Y Pathan to Warner,SIX
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,4.1,"Narine to Warner, SIX, it's a 20-ball fifty for Davey Warner, what entertainment from the Aussie. Greets Narine in grand style. This was the normal offie on the stumps, Warner was early into position for the switch-hit and he sent that over the square third man fence. Raise of the bat to acknowledge all the applause. Joint-fastest fifty by a SRH player in IPL",Narine to Warner,SIX
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,6.1,"U Yadav to Warner, SIX, wowww! What a shot. No lapse in concentration even after the break. Umesh errs in his length, slightly short in length, Warner muscles the pull hard over mid-wicket and the bat made a sweet sound as it made contact with the ball",U Yadav to Warner,SIX
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,8.4,"Coulter-Nile to Warner, SIX, what a way to bring up the century partnership. NCN went short with this slower delivery, but Warner got the placement right. There was a man at deep mid-wicket and it went at a catchable height, but he hit it to his right",Coulter-Nile to Warner,SIX
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,9.5,"Kuldeep Yadav to Warner, SIX, dropped and it's Woakes again. He misjudged one in the second over off Warner, now he's palmed this over the long-off rope. This was an easy catch. Shake of the head. Has already cost the team around 80 runs at least. Shortish and outside off stump, Warner hit that off the back foot, didn't get the distance, but the fielder misjudges the catch",Kuldeep Yadav to Warner,SIX
4078176,MI 1st Inns,18.0,"Aniket Choudhary to Hardik Pandya, SIX, and the last ball has cost 7. Could well cost RCB the match as well. A nothing short ball, around waist high and Hardik Pandya has muscled the pull flat into the deep square stands. Looks like he was waiting for the short one, Aniket Choudhary didn't get any shoulder or height on that, Kohli is not happy at all. Suddenly now the equation looks easy",Aniket Choudhary to Hardik Pandya,SIX
4078176,MI 1st Inns,18.3,"Aravind to Rohit, SIX, brilliant. Just brilliant. Rohit knows that it will be on a length and slower, knows that it will be majorly outside off as well, so what does he do? Shuffles across and delectably plays a half sweep, yes a sweep, that sails into the unmanned deep square fence. Didn't look like carrying all the way, but it was a flat hit",Aravind to Rohit,SIX
4078176,MI 1st Inns,6.0,"Chahal to Buttler, SIX, the idea was right from Chahal to flight the ball to the Englishman, but when it's too full, the ball hardly has any distance to spin on the batsman. Buttler moves his left leg out of the way and smashes it high over the mid-wicket boundary",Chahal to Buttler,SIX
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,12.1,"Krunal Pandya to de Villiers, SIX, great shot. Walks across his stumps, gets outside off and then sweeps it almost into the first tier. Sailed a long way into the deep backward square stands. Is that the strike that gets him back into his fearsome best? Let's wait and watch",Krunal Pandya to de Villiers,SIX
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,17.1,"Malinga to Negi, SIX, caught by the ballboy. Outside the boundary of course. RCB needed that. Negi backs away and picks the slower delivery, lofts well and off the middle of the bat. Just crossed the ropes at long-off and well taken low by the man who is the centre of attraction as the cameras pan to him",Malinga to Negi,SIX
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,17.5,"Malinga to Negi, SIX, second six of the over. Again it is Negi who is doing the damage. Rushed out and clouted the slower delivery high and long. Hardik at long-off tried his best, leaping with one hand to his right, but the ball was always winning that battle. Just over him and six",Malinga to Negi,SIX
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,18.3,"Bumrah to Negi, SIX, third six for Negi. Bumrah went for the slower delivery after two yorkers. Negi was sitting in his crease and waiting for that. A mighty swing over long-on and that's the biggest of the lot for him. Chahal is seen clapping from the dressing room",Bumrah to Negi,SIX
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,3.2,"Karn Sharma to Kohli, SIX, a step forward and then thump over long-on. All bottom hand in that. Trademark Kohli. Saw the flight on that leggie and then thumped it with lots of wrist and the bottom hand took over. Long-on was just a spectator",Karn Sharma to Kohli,SIX
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,4.2,"Bumrah to Kohli, SIX, what wrists he has. Played a similar kind of shot against Basil Thampi a couple of games ago. That one flew over deep square leg, this over long-on. A little shimmy and picks the slower delivery, then the wrists take over. Like a flick of a switch, he uncorks those wrists and the ball sails a long way over long-on. No-one else in world cricket can play that pickup shot from the pads as well as Kohli does",Bumrah to Kohli,SIX
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,5.5,"McClenaghan to de Villiers, SIX, is sweeper in business? No. It has gone all the way. Down the wicket and then cuts it hard and flat over the deep man's head. For a moment Buttler reckoned he was in with a chance, but it flew over his head",McClenaghan to de Villiers,SIX
4078176,RCB 1st Inns,8.3,"Krunal Pandya to de Villiers, SIX, makes room and goes outside leg, sits down and then unleashes the slog-sweep. A flat hit over mid-wicket and all the way",Krunal Pandya to de Villiers,SIX
5594334,GL 1st Inns,2.5,"Unadkat to Ishan Kishan, SIX, now he's cleared long leg here. Never looked like clearing it, trust me, but this guy packs a punch. Nicely inclined himself outside the line, with no feet, opening the area on the leg-side. Hoicked it up and over, and cleared the man in the deep, who was right at the boundary",Unadkat to Ishan Kishan,SIX
5594334,GL 1st Inns,3.5,"Washington Sundar to Ishan Kishan, SIX, that's a tripe length. Short and Kishan has pulled him over deep mid-wicket. No fuss. Looked a six the moment he hit it, unlike that hoick over long leg last over",Washington Sundar to Ishan Kishan,SIX
5594334,GL 1st Inns,4.3,"Stokes to Brendon McCullum, SIX, now smacks the bejeezus out of this. Gets his front leg out and hacks this ball over mid-wicket. All the way. Need drones to catch it",Stokes to Brendon McCullum,SIX
5594334,GL 1st Inns,9.0,"Christian to Brendon McCullum, SIX, and look at how McCullum celebrates Stokes no-bullseye last ball. Gets the right length to smack his bat right across to, and does so effectively. Hedgehopped over deep mid-wicket",Christian to Brendon McCullum,SIX
5594334,GL 1st Inns,9.1,"Tahir to Finch, SIX, what can a bowler do. Bowl, they say. Perfectly good ball from Tahir here. Wrong 'un on off stump but Finch has his front leg out, smacking it over deep mid-wicket with the turn. What have you got, Tahir?",Tahir to Finch,SIX
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,14.2,"Faulkner to Dhoni, SIX, this shot is all about the sound it made. Goes back and across to this short ball and hammers the pull over the deep mid-wicket fence",Faulkner to Dhoni,SIX
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,15.2,"Dwayne Smith to Stokes, SIX, that could have taken a couple of them down in the crowd. Stokes swings. Why not. Length ball, sits up there and Stokes just swings across. ""The big Ben,"" the screen displays",Dwayne Smith to Stokes,SIX
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,18.1,"Basil Thampi to Stokes, SIX, oh dear, that simplifies things. A 79-meter six. 19 needed off 11 now. A full toss and that has been bruted over long-on. A full-blooded bat swat and boom, it's outta here",Basil Thampi to Stokes,SIX
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,18.5,"Basil Thampi to Stokes, SIX, for a moment, I thought it's headed to long-off. But Finch was there, and the ball would have cleared Finch on Finch's shoulders there. Long, big hit. Made room, as he's been doing, and clouts it over the fielder. Way over him, as I have made amply clear",Basil Thampi to Stokes,SIX
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,19.5,"Faulkner to Christian, SIX, Dhoni and Smith half-hug in the dug out, Pune's crowd cheers its lungs out. Supergiant beat Gujarat for the first time ever in IPL. Christian gets a ball sitting up and scythes the ball over square leg. Way over it. With that, it's goodbye RCB from IPL 2017",Faulkner to Christian,SIX
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,4.2,"Sangwan to Stokes, SIX, short ball and Stokes seems to have got his eye in. Goes back in no time and times the pull well over the deep backward square leg fence. Goes deep into the stands",Sangwan to Stokes,SIX
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,9.2,"Jadeja to Stokes, SIX, when 11 deliveries have been dot out of 12, you do such things. Like going across the line and sending it well over cow corner for a maxium",Jadeja to Stokes,SIX
5594334,RPS 1st Inns,9.3,"Jadeja to Stokes, SIX, and when the bowler dares to flight, you - on the back of confidence - try it again. This time, Stokes clubs it well over the long-on fence. Too big a hit",Jadeja to Stokes,SIX
8831525,DC 1st Inns,1.1,"Siraj to Samson, SIX, that's a glorious shot! Siraj bangs it short without any venom behind it. Samson stands tall and launches it over long-off. See the ball and hit the ball. He hit that and stood for the photographs",Siraj to Samson,SIX
8831525,DC 1st Inns,11.3,"Siraj to Pant, SIX, this guy and his timing. Reads this short ball early and waits on the back foot. Pulls from there into the deep square leg fence",Siraj to Pant,SIX
8831525,DC 1st Inns,12.5,"Yuvraj to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, another loose ball around off. Shreyas Iyer swings across the line and for a moment it seems he is in danger of skying this one. But he is not, sends over the long-on fence. Mighty hit",Yuvraj to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
8831525,DC 1st Inns,13.0,"Yuvraj to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, and again! Unlike Corey Anderson, Shreyas Iyer does not miss out on this short ball. Camps back in time and thunders the pull deep into the stands over deep mid-wicket",Yuvraj to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
8831525,DC 1st Inns,14.0,"S Kaul to Corey Anderson, SIX, after a barrage of mistimed swipes and pulls finally Corey Anderson gets one off the middle of the willow. And when he gets those off the meat, no ground is big enough. A length ball served with gentle pace. What else does he need? Swings and swings well to clear the man at long-on",S Kaul to Corey Anderson,SIX
8831525,DC 1st Inns,16.3,"Siraj to Corey Anderson, SIX, bye bye ball. Slips on the legs of Corey Anderson. Was a slower ball and Corey Anderson whipped it from there, skies it high but gets the distance as well. Manages to clear Dhawan at deep square leg",Siraj to Corey Anderson,SIX
8831525,DC 1st Inns,17.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Corey Anderson, SIX, if not for the stands this would have travelled more. Might have got the metro from Pragati Maidan. Fuller length and Corey Anderson cleared his front leg, cracked it hard and hit flat over the long-on fence",Bhuvneshwar to Corey Anderson,SIX
8831525,DC 1st Inns,18.4,"S Kaul to Chris Morris, SIX, at the outset this one did not seem to have come off the middle. But he had timed it well. Has that power to clear the fence. A short ball and Chris Morris pulls well over the deep mid-wicket fielder",S Kaul to Chris Morris,SIX
8831525,DC 1st Inns,3.5,"S Kaul to Nair, SIX, third man in business? Nope, over him. Cheeky shot from the Karnataka batsman. It was banged in short outside off, Nair waits for it and periscopes it over the non-existent slip. Has enough power to go over third man, who thought he might have a chance there",S Kaul to Nair,SIX
8831525,DC 1st Inns,5.4,"Henriques to Nair, SIX, Nair is on a roll here! Straight, length ball, Nair moves leg-side and launches it straight over the bowler's head. The ball sails over the sightscreen for a maximum",Henriques to Nair,SIX
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,17.4,"Rabada to Yuvraj, SIX, not off the middle, but it doesn't have to be when it is Yuvraj Singh.

8831525,SRH 1st Inns,2.4,"Jayant Yadav to Warner, SIX, this is the advantage of having the ability to play the switch-hit. You can't set fields for such shots. A good flighted delivery on the stumps, nothing wrong with the delivery, Warner makes decent connection, although it was a top edge and it cleared the rope over backward point",Jayant Yadav to Warner,SIX
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,3.5,"Chris Morris to Dhawan, SIX, he's so good with that pick up shot. Plays it in his own way. Stylish! Morris once again bowls the perfect length to lift over the top, the full ball was on the leg as well and Dhawan used his lovely wrists to whip it away over the mid-wicket boundary",Chris Morris to Dhawan,SIX
8831525,SRH 1st Inns,7.5,"Jayant Yadav to Williamson, SIX, oh dear! That's released all the pressure. He'd beaten Williamson twice and then follows it up with a filthy delivery in the form of trying a variation. He suggests that he wanted to bowl the carrom ball, but it slipped down the leg-side and Williamson helped himself to a six with a pull over backward square leg",Jayant Yadav to Williamson,SIX
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,11.5,"Tahir to de Grandhomme, SIX, ""that's Colin de Grandhomme,"" goes Doully on air. He spots the googly, kneels down and slog sweeps it with the spin over cow corner. He's a big man and that ball sailed a long way into the crowd",Tahir to de Grandhomme,SIX
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,12.0,"Tahir to de Grandhomme, SIX, consecutive sixes for de Grandhomme. Should have been caught. Once more goes with the turn, lofts the leggie towards long-off. Got height more than the distance, Christian moves across to his left and parries it over the fence. He misjudged the rope behind him. There was enough space to go a foot back",Tahir to de Grandhomme,SIX
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,17.3,"Christian to Suryakumar Yadav, SIX, is it Suryakumar's night? Has been quiet in the tournament and has been in-and-out of the side as well. Picked the back of a length slower delivery, pivoted on his front leg and pulled it over deep square leg",Christian to Suryakumar Yadav,SIX
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,18.3,"Unadkat to Suryakumar Yadav, SIX, 14 off the first three balls. Unadkat is predictable and Suryakumar is toying with him, plants his front foot across the stumps, laps it over backward square, a better connection meant maximum result",Unadkat to Suryakumar Yadav,SIX
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,18.5,"Unadkat to Coulter-Nile, SIX, Collision between Smith and Stokes. The latter straightaway calls for the physio. After crashing into Stokes, Smith goes bang into the ad boardings. Head first and it bounced off. Smith gets up and has a word with the physio. Seems to be fine. That looked brutal. Slower delivery from Unadkat and Coulter-Nile swung across the line towards deep mid-wicket. Stokes ran to his left and Smith ran to his right from long-on. Both were watching the ball and not each other. It was the Englishman who caught the ball, but once he dashed into Smith the flick back didn't go where he intended",Unadkat to Coulter-Nile,SIX
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"Washington Sundar to Gambhir, SIX, wow! This is brutal! Dances down the track and goes big with the swing. Sends well over the long-on fence",Washington Sundar to Gambhir,SIX
2525767,KKR 1st Inns,7.5,"Tahir to M Pandey, SIX, he goes against the turn, I assume! And then takes the biggest part of the ground to hit this one. But Pandey has got this one right off the middle of the bat to leave the fielder at the fence as a mere spectator",Tahir to M Pandey,SIX
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,12.2,"Kuldeep Yadav to Tripathi, SIX, how well has he hit that? Boy! He is having some fun out there. Skates out of his crease, wasn't quite to the pitch, but why bother? He swung it handsomely over mid-wicket",Kuldeep Yadav to Tripathi,SIX
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,12.3,"Kuldeep Yadav to Tripathi, SIX, another one! Bam bam! He reaches his highest T20 score and does it in some style. Greyhounds down the pitch and takes Kuldeep Yadav for a journey over mid-wicket",Kuldeep Yadav to Tripathi,SIX
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,12.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Tripathi, SIX, my word! Don't drop it there to this lad. On seeing the loop, he gets down on his knees and bludgeons it barrel straight over the bowler's head. Runs raining at KKR's E-DEN",Kuldeep Yadav to Tripathi,SIX
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,17.0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Tripathi, SIX, on one knee and launched! Tripathi into the 90s. Wanted to have a piece of Kuldeep Yadav once more, got down and thwacked him with a slog-sweep over mid-wicket",Kuldeep Yadav to Tripathi,SIX
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,19.2,"de Grandhomme to Christian, SIX. All over! Some glum faces among the crowd. Three back to back wins for RPS. A right-handed version of Ben Stokes, Christian waits for the short ball, once it arrives, he murders the pull flat over mid-wicket",de Grandhomme to Christian,SIX
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,2.4,"Coulter-Nile to Tripathi, SIX, this must be demoralising for Coulter-Nile. Telegrams his intentions and shimmies out to meet the pitch, converts it into a full ball and blasts it over extra cover. Enough to carry it all the way",Coulter-Nile to Tripathi,SIX
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,3.5,"U Yadav to Tripathi, SIX, imperious. What a strike from Tripathi. Isn't intimidated by this short ball, takes it from over his head and deposits it over the long-leg fence. He got into the position early and hooked it off the meat off the bat",U Yadav to Tripathi,SIX
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,4.2,"Woakes to Smith, SIX, wow. Gorgeuous from Smith. Brings up the fastest fifty for RPS in IPL. Stands motionless and lets his hands do the talking. Extends his arms and lifts it handsomely into the long-on stands",Woakes to Smith,SIX
2525767,RPS 1st Inns,5.3,"Coulter-Nile to Tripathi, SIX, terrific striking from Tripathi. Gets right back to this short ball and muscles it away over the cow corner fence for a maximum",Coulter-Nile to Tripathi,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,10.2,"Faulkner to Pant, SIX, he was undone by the lack of pace there. Early into the shot but made sure that he swung hard at this. Bruted it. And as much as it lacked the timing, it made up with its power, this shot. Clouted over deep mid-wicket, despite coming off the bottom half of the bat",Faulkner to Pant,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,10.5,"Faulkner to Pant, SIX, what do you do to a slow bouncer? You bully it. Despite being in a tangle with your footwork. Had the weight back and could pull the bejeezus out of it. Brilliant shot",Faulkner to Pant,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,11.0,"Faulkner to Pant, SIX, *jumps into a well* This is turning out to be a ridiculously good innings. Unicorns are real, and so are DD chases. Gets a pitched up delivery and slogs it over long-on. No half measures. None at all. Pick the length and swing. Has been so successful so far",Faulkner to Pant,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,11.1,"Jadeja to Samson, SIX, umm. This looked effortless and it's gone into the crowd. Just a length ball, turning away and Samson has swatted it over long-on. Clocked 99 meters as if it's body temperature",Jadeja to Samson,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,11.2,"Jadeja to Samson, SIX, wide and slotted over covers. And it wasn't a bad ball from Jadeja, drifting it wide and making Samson reach out. But erred in the length and paid by six runs. That's it",Jadeja to Samson,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,13.3,"Jadeja to Pant, SIX, brilliant. A slog sweep that's been nailed into the stands, again. Nothing more I can add. He's just seeing the length so early tonight and readying himself for the hits",Jadeja to Pant,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,16.0,"Sangwan to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, oh just a touch overpitched. And so overpitched that the change of pace doesn't matter much. And to make things worse, Iyer had read it. So waits a little longer and dumps the ball over long-off. More timing than anything else. Connected the ball at the right time and boom, you can hit it with a spoon too. Well, not really. 20 off 24 needed",Sangwan to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,16.4,"Basil Thampi to Corey Anderson, SIX, another six. Length ball, around off and Anderson has swung it over deep square leg. It's that sort of a day. 18 sixes already",Basil Thampi to Corey Anderson,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,17.0,"Basil Thampi to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, here's another. Shuffled across early, and was able to open up the long leg region. Picked the ball up and bottom-handed it over the ropes there. Just 4 needed",Basil Thampi to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,17.3,"Faulkner to Corey Anderson, SIX, Delhi have their highest ever run-chase. Anderson gets a full ball and pumps it over long-on to seal what was an easy win in the end",Faulkner to Corey Anderson,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,2.1,"Sangwan to Samson, SIX, wow. This is from Samson's refrigarator of awesomeness. Pure class. Drops it a tad short, does Sangwan. Samson is ready for it. Handsomely hacks it behind square, such is the power that it carries all the way for a maximum",Sangwan to Samson,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,3.1,"Basil Thampi to Pant, SIX, quality from Pant. Thampi bowls it short and compliments it with width, Pant reaches out and spanks it over cover",Basil Thampi to Pant,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,4.0,"Basil Thampi to Samson, SIX, you cannot afford to spray it on Samson's pads. Thampi just does that and gets punished. He gets inside the line and whips it nonchalantly behind square. Half a dozen!",Basil Thampi to Samson,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,4.1,"Sangwan to Pant, SIX, Pant joins into the act. High percentage shot this. Hauls his back leg in the air and elegantly swipes it into the deep square leg stands",Sangwan to Pant,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,4.2,"Sangwan to Pant, SIX, ""Three sixes in a row for Delhi"" screams Scott Styris on air. Finesse followed by violence. Loads up big time, gets under this full ball and smashes it over long-on. Soars a long way into the stands",Sangwan to Pant,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,6.2,"Raina to Samson, SIX, in the slot and out of the park. 500th six of the tournament. Loops it up in the arc for Samson, no turn. Samson lowers his stance and launches it over cow corner",Raina to Samson,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,7.5,"Ankit Soni to Pant, SIX, what a shot. The googly from Soni, but pitches it up fuller outside off. Pant isn't sparing those. Flexes his arms and murders it straight over the bowler's head for a maximum",Ankit Soni to Pant,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,9.0,"Raina to Pant, SIX, fifty for Pant. Reaches the landmark in style. A rank long hop from Raina, Pant is onto it in a flash. Skips back and smokes it away into the deep mid-wicket stands. 14 runs off the over",Raina to Pant,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,9.1,"Ankit Soni to Samson, SIX, ugly from Soni. Perhaps, took a cue from his skipper. Half-tracker, sits up nicely for Samson. He gets under it and clubs it over deep mid-wicket",Ankit Soni to Samson,SIX
2608816,DC 1st Inns,9.3,"Ankit Soni to Samson, SIX, brilliant. Soni floats it up full, Samson is ready for it. Unleashes his muscles and dumps it over the bowler's head for a maximum. Raina walks up immediately and consoles the bowler",Ankit Soni to Samson,SIX
2608816,GL 1st Inns,10.1,"Samuels to Raina, SIX, no sir! Don't bowl there, he'll thrash you even in his sleep. When it's full and that front leg is out of the way, he hardly misses out on the slog. He was down on one knee and smashed this over mid-wicket",Samuels to Raina,SIX
2608816,GL 1st Inns,11.0,"Samuels to Raina, SIX, once again Samuels errs on the fuller side and Raina is not afraid to hit the ball in the air. Hits it very straight and ensures that long-off and long-on were not in the picture",Samuels to Raina,SIX
2608816,GL 1st Inns,11.2,"Nadeem to Karthik, SIX, every time the spinners have dropped it short, Karthik has done very well to rock back, make excellent use of the crease and pull it handsomely over mid-wicket. This had a lot of hang time on it",Nadeem to Karthik,SIX
2608816,GL 1st Inns,11.3,"Nadeem to Karthik, SIX, wowww! The shot of the day for me! The greatest thing about this shot was Karthik didn't manage to get close to the pitch of the ball after jumping down the pitch, yet went through the lofted inside-out drive and sent it over the cover boundary",Nadeem to Karthik,SIX
2608816,GL 1st Inns,12.4,"Corey Anderson to Karthik, SIX, Karthik is turning the heat on. Not off the middle, but Karthik won't mind as he got enough wood on his hook against this short ball that sails over the long leg fence",Corey Anderson to Karthik,SIX
2608816,GL 1st Inns,13.4,"Shami to Karthik, SIX, wow! Brilliantly played. It was short and wide outside off, Karthik waits for it and slashes it. Didn't bother to keep it down and up she goes. Over backward point and the ball sails over the boundary rope",Shami to Karthik,SIX
2608816,GL 1st Inns,19.5,"Corey Anderson to Jadeja, SIX, that's a monster! Full and right in the slot for Jadeja to swing his bat hard. Jaddu stands tall and biffs it over long-on for a gigantic six",Corey Anderson to Jadeja,SIX
2608816,GL 1st Inns,20.0,"Corey Anderson to Jadeja, SIX, highest ever total for Gujarat Lions! Jadeja finishes the innings in style. That's Dhoni-esque. Slower shortish ball. Jadeja waits and waits for it to come to him and smacks the pull over deep mid-wicket. 17 runs off the final over",Corey Anderson to Jadeja,SIX
2608816,GL 1st Inns,3.1,"Shami to Raina, SIX, why on earth did they remove Rabada after that brilliant over? Raina was never comfortable against him. This Delhi team does strange things! Shami serves up a length ball on the leg stump, Raina is good when he connects those slogs and he has done decently well this time, flew over wide mid-on",Shami to Raina,SIX
2608816,GL 1st Inns,4.3,"Rabada to Raina, SIX, no problems with connecting this one from the middle of the bat. Length ball right in the slot and he's in the mood to swing at everything, lofts down the ground, goes over mid-on and goes all the way. Somehow, Raina has raced to 33 off 17 balls",Rabada to Raina,SIX
2608816,GL 1st Inns,8.0,"Mishra to Karthik, SIX, the googly again, but it's way too short. Karthik jumps on the back foot, times the pull well enough to send it high in the air and over the mid-wicket boundary. A poor over that from Mishra, bowled well to Raina, but was very poor with his length to Karthik",Mishra to Karthik,SIX
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,15.3,"Chahal to Axar, SIX, floated up on a fuller length and Axar says thank you very much. A much needed six for KXIP. Axar plonks his front foot forward and hammers the loft with the turn over long-on",Chahal to Axar,SIX
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,19.1,"Watson to Axar, SIX, massive hit! Makes a dent on the ad hoardings on the roof. Right in the arc - length delivery and outside off, Axar clears his front leg and heaves it all the way over long-on. Needs to play all the six balls",Watson to Axar,SIX
3930354,KXIP 1st Inns,8.5,"Negi to Vohra, SIX, he's a good striker of the cricket ball and Negi erred in his length. Too full and allowed the batsman to get under the ball, Vohra was down on one knee to smash it over the leaping long-on fielder",Negi to Vohra,SIX
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,1.1,"T Natarajan to Mandeep, SIX, gosh, no! A short ball down leg and Mandeep had helped the pull over fine leg with utter nonchalance. And given how slow this pitch is, bouncers aren't exactly themselves. They are friends",T Natarajan to Mandeep,SIX
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,4.4,"Sandeep Sharma to de Villiers, SIX, umm, you aren't a cricket binge-watcher if you didn't see this coming. Dropped short, and AB has smacked it into the oblivion. Over deep mid-wicket. You would envy how early AB sees things, cricket lengths here. Got into the position beautifully and swatted it away",Sandeep Sharma to de Villiers,SIX
3930354,RCB 1st Inns,9.5,"Mohit Sharma to Mandeep, SIX, clobbered over mid-wicket. Stays put, and waits for the ball to arrive, before laying into a delicate bat-swing over cow corner",Mohit Sharma to Mandeep,SIX
4825658,RPS 1st Inns,10.2,"Bipul Sharma to Stokes, SIX, Stokes has seen enough. Decides to up the ante and succeeds. Lowers his stance to reach the ball, unleashes his strong muscles and thumps it over deep mid-wicket",Bipul Sharma to Stokes,SIX
4825658,RPS 1st Inns,10.3,"Bipul Sharma to Stokes, SIX, two in two! Left-arm spin against Stokes? Not a good idea. He takes a step forward this time, wasn't quite to the pitch but he extends his long levers to butcher it into the deep mid-wicket stands",Bipul Sharma to Stokes,SIX
4825658,RPS 1st Inns,12.4,"Bipul Sharma to Stokes, SIX, Stokes is teeing off. Third six off Bipul. Spots the shorter ball early, skips back and flat-bats it over long-on",Bipul Sharma to Stokes,SIX
4825658,RPS 1st Inns,18.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Dhoni, SIX, Dhoni has found his elements. A short ball without any purpose, sits up nicely for Dhoni. He rocks back and muscles the pull over deep mid-wicket. The crowd aren't willing to return the ball. So, the fourth umpire has arrived with a set of replacements",Bhuvneshwar to Dhoni,SIX
4825658,RPS 1st Inns,18.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Dhoni, SIX, you miss the length, you will get punished. The idea was good from Kumar, but the execution was horrible. Fullish outside off, Dhoni throws his weight across and bullies it over extra cover. A flat six",Bhuvneshwar to Dhoni,SIX
4825658,RPS 1st Inns,5.3,"Henriques to Rahane, SIX, piles on his luck. Unleashes the first boundary of the day clearing his front leg, walking into the line and down in executing the full bat swing as he clinically dispatches it with a tonk over long-on. All timing",Henriques to Rahane,SIX
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,13.0,"Stokes to Yuvraj, SIX, class! Everything right about this shot. Just a pleasing sight to see Yuvraj smack a six straight back over the bowler. Fuller and on the stumps, the full face of the bat comes to the fore and then the extension of the arms to send it sailing over the rope",Stokes to Yuvraj,SIX
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,16.2,"Christian to Yuvraj, SIX, much needed hit for SRH. Short delivery and not much pace to trouble Yuvraj, was bowled at 120kph and sat up nicely, Yuvraj pulls it off the front foot into the deep square leg stand",Christian to Yuvraj,SIX
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,17.2,"Unadkat to Naman Ojha, SIX, Ojha can strike the ball. So, SRH fans, hang in there. Unadkat switches to round the wicket and dishes out a slower delivery on a length, Ojha swings as hard as possible and sends it over long-on. Got plenty of height and for a second might have thought he was in trouble, but Christian was reduced to a spectator",Unadkat to Naman Ojha,SIX
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,2.3,"Unadkat to Dhawan, SIX, Dhawan is looking in good touch, length delivery outside off, he was quick to shuffle across, gets into a good position and heaves it over the mid-wicket fence",Unadkat to Dhawan,SIX
4825658,SRH 1st Inns,7.2,"Tahir to Warner, SIX, cracking shot, this was the leg-break, but the line was too full, allowed Warner to get underneath the ball and lift it back over his head, went all the way for the first maximum of the chase, for Warner",Tahir to Warner,SIX
9316064,DC 1st Inns,10.3,"Harbhajan to Shami, SIX, that is a good hit! Slogs with the turn and hits it well over the long-on fence. 91 metre hit that",Harbhajan to Shami,SIX
9316064,DC 1st Inns,3.0,"McClenaghan to Nair, SIX, sound! Often that is an indication of the timing. Nair clubs the length ball over mid-wicket. Looked a bit early on the shot but manages to put more than enough behind the shot to power it over the lurking fielder at the boundary",McClenaghan to Nair,SIX
9316064,DC 1st Inns,8.1,"Harbhajan to Pat Cummins, SIX, he goes and goes big. What helps him the sensible approach - that is to go with the turn. Clubs over cow corner for a maximum",Harbhajan to Pat Cummins,SIX
9316064,MI 1st Inns,10.3,"Mishra to Pollard, SIX, massive, nicely tossed up on off, Pollard gets his left leg out of the way and swings through the line, plenty of height and way into the stands, long-off was a mere spectator",Mishra to Pollard,SIX
9316064,MI 1st Inns,10.5,"Mishra to Pollard, SIX, the short straight boundaries has worked against Mishra here. He can't believe it - for a moment, long-off thought it was an easy chance, but he kept watching it soar over his head. Coming to the ball, it was another lovely leg-break, Pollard was completely done in by it, mistimes it badly and still gets a maximum. Who wants to be a bowler in T20s?",Mishra to Pollard,SIX
9316064,MI 1st Inns,11.4,"Pat Cummins to Simmons, SIX, massive, once again the batsman seemed to be done in by the length, but Simmons has still managed to send this one way into the stands at wide long-on. On a good length and on the stumps, Simmons was backing away on the slog, had to drag it in the end and still gets plenty of bat on it",Pat Cummins to Simmons,SIX
9316064,MI 1st Inns,12.2,"Corey Anderson to Simmons, SIX, cracking shot, slower short ball from Anderson, Simmons walks across the stumps and pulls it high and over mid-wicket, went a long way into the stands",Corey Anderson to Simmons,SIX

9316064,MI 1st Inns,13.3,"Mishra to Pollard, SIX, another biggie and Pollard has deposited this one into the top tier of Kotla. Mishra gave this one plenty of air, Pollard gets a big stride forward and dismisses it high and over long-on. He's looking extremely dangerous",Mishra to Pollard,SIX
9316064,MI 1st Inns,17.2,"Corey Anderson to Hardik Pandya, SIX, the ball hits the ad cushions on the full. Slanted across the right-hander, Pandya stands his ground and smokes it over extra cover. Two men in front of square riding the boundary and he split them to perfection",Corey Anderson to Hardik Pandya,SIX
9316064,MI 1st Inns,19.4,"Pat Cummins to Hardik Pandya, SIX, brings up the 200 and the 50-run stand in style. The cross-seam full delivery, Hardik stays right back in his crease and lifts it over mid-off, the 146kph delivery sailed over the rope",Pat Cummins to Hardik Pandya,SIX
9316064,MI 1st Inns,19.5,"Pat Cummins to Hardik Pandya, SIX, they have recovered from that tidy last over. Back of a length delivery and Hardik short-arm pulls it over deep mid-wicket, the short boundaries taking care of the rest",Pat Cummins to Hardik Pandya,SIX
9316064,MI 1st Inns,3.2,"Rabada to Simmons, SIX, reminds of that night in Mumbai. Flat-batted pull on this back of a length delivery. Does not go high in the air, almost goes flat to the deep mid-wicket fence. So much power behind this one",Rabada to Simmons,SIX
9316064,MI 1st Inns,4.1,"Zaheer to Simmons, SIX, that is not the longest part at Kotla - the area behind square on the on-side. And to make things easy, it is a short ball down the leg-side. Simmons waits and thunders the pull well over the fence. Simmons is turning it on. Does not take much time to change the entire context",Zaheer to Simmons,SIX
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,0.4,"Aniket Choudhary to Chris Lynn, SIX, two fours followed by a six, Lynnsanity is back ladies and gentlemen. Nothing but a back of a length delivery and the golf like swing comes to the fore, slapped over the wide long-on fence",Aniket Choudhary to Chris Lynn,SIX
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,10.0,"Badree to de Grandhomme, SIX, he's got hold of that. You bet he has. Badree skids it through from a length on middle, de Grandhomme takes a shimmy down and launches it over deep mid-wicket",Badree to de Grandhomme,SIX
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,12.5,"Head to de Grandhomme, SIX, that's a six and a half! Into the top tier. Head floats it up right into the slot outside off, and that's all the swinging room which de Grandhomme needs as he sinks on his knees and destroys it over wide long-on",Head to de Grandhomme,SIX
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,2.4,"Chahal to Chris Lynn, SIX, good use of the feet. Chahal floats it up on leg-stump, Lynn dances down and lofts it straight back over Chahal. The key was to play it with a straight bat and he did it with utter ease. Almost sent it into the press box",Chahal to Chris Lynn,SIX
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,3.1,"Badree to Narine, SIX, Narine had the better off Badree in the reverse fixture and nothing has changed. Tossed up outside off, Narine goes through the line and the loft travels all the way over long-off",Badree to Narine,SIX
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,3.2,"Badree to Narine, SIX, same. Badree keeps flighting them up and Narine keeps sending them into the stands. A clean swing of the bat and the ball sails over the long-off fence. Back-to-back sixes",Badree to Narine,SIX
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,3.3,"Badree to Narine, SIX, hat-trick of sixes. Badree is being taken to the cleaners by his mate. A repeat of the previous two shots, Badree needs to change things up, he ends up bowling in Narine's half and the big hit clears long-off with ease",Badree to Narine,SIX
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,4.5,"Aravind to Narine, SIX, there's the fastest IPL fifty. Sunil Narine is the proud owner of that record. If someone had told me that he would be the holder of that record, I would be laughing my guts out, but here he is proving almost everyone wrong. Short of length and Narine goes on his toes and lofts it over long-on. That is a very difficult shot to play and even the best of batsman find it hard, but Narine does it with ease. The KKR dugout are on their feet and GG is leading the applause. For once he has a smile on his face",Aravind to Narine,SIX
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,5.1,"Chahal to Chris Lynn, SIX, the explosion does not seem to stop. KKR keep steamrolling. Lynn uses his feet to the flighted delivery and lofts it beautifully over the long-off. Who said he can't play spin?",Chahal to Chris Lynn,SIX
4967787,KKR 1st Inns,6.0,"Chahal to Chris Lynn, SIX, it is now the highest team total in the powerplay. RCB have found new ways to create records. Chahal keeps tossing them up and Lynn sinks to one knee to slog sweep it into the deep mid-wicket fence",Chahal to Chris Lynn,SIX
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,13.4,"Narine to Head, SIX, Head has a reputation of a clean-hitter, but we haven't seen any of that this season.

4967787,RCB 1st Inns,18.0,"Rajpoot to Head, SIX, finishes the over with a maximum. Walks down the wicket to get close to the pitch of the ball and then hoicks it over the cow corner fence. Gets the crowd going as well. Good day for Rajpoot in the office, 4-0-25-0",Rajpoot to Head,SIX
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,18.5,"Woakes to Head, SIX, Woakes misses the length and pays the price. Lands it right in the swinging arc and Head ain't missing out, clears his front leg to get and strikes it cleanly over the long-off fence",Woakes to Head,SIX
4967787,RCB 1st Inns,19.4,"U Yadav to Head, SIX, caught, in the crowd. 109 meters. That's a monster.

2553863,MI 1st Inns,17.5,"Boult to Pollard, SIX, a mistime. That's what it was. And it is a crowd catch. The brute that this man is. Gets a pounder on a back of a length climbing up much more than Pollard would have liked but he doesn't bother adjusting. Mows across the line, gets it high on the bat and it the cow corner fence takes the brunt",Boult to Pollard,SIX
2553863,MI 1st Inns,18.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Rayudu, SIX, another charge, another bat swing, another boundary. Gets really close this time and has it in him to go straight down again. All in the air this time. All the way this time too",Kuldeep Yadav to Rayudu,SIX

1922365,KXIP 1st Inns,8.2,"Zampa to Axar, SIX, poor ball from Zampa, drops one short and on the stumps, Axar rocks back and pulls it high and over mid-wicket, has just enough to clear the ropes on the full",Zampa to Axar,SIX

9401301,DC 1st Inns,18.3,"Avesh Khan to Shami, SIX, Shami has not given up, not just yet. A pitched up ball around off, clears the front leg and and cracks hard.

9401301,DC 1st Inns,3.5,"Chahal to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, Chahal gives it little more air this time. Shreyas Iyer jumps out of his crease quickly and thumbs it over long-on for a maximum. First one of the innings",Chahal to Shreyas Iyer,SIX

9401301,RCB 1st Inns,11.2,"Mishra to Gayle, SIX, a Gayle special. Mishra darts the quicker front of the hand stuff. And he darts it half way down the pitch as well. All the time for Gayle to rock back and swat him away. High and mighty",Mishra to Gayle,SIX
9401301,RCB 1st Inns,11.4,"Mishra to Kohli, SIX, more of the juicy Mishraji half-trackers. More of the dispatches. This time it is off Kohli. Stays behind with the weight going backwards and a short arm jab in the air. Into his favoured cow corner region",Mishra to Kohli,SIX
9401301,RCB 1st Inns,16.2,"Zaheer to Kohli, SIX, a clear case of a missed yorker. Ends up becoming a juicy full toss and Kohli stands and swishes across the line. Several rows into his favoured mid-wicket stands",Zaheer to Kohli,SIX

4600914,MI 1st Inns,20.0,"SN Thakur to Malinga, SIX, Dhoni carves a final spot for Pune in IPL 2017. What a 'Sundar' performance. It means beautiful in Hindi.. Anyway, assuming you have let that pass, let's get back to cricket: Malinga finishes by swatting a six over deep mid-wicket, where the fielder almost has it but then dives over the ropes. Nothing matters. Cricket doesn't allow 27 runs to be scored off one ball. Sane cricket, so to say",SN Thakur to Malinga,SIX
4600914,MI 1st Inns,3.3,"Lockie Ferguson to Parthiv Patel, SIX, the pocket rocket of Mumbai Indians is trying to squeeze maximum off the powerplay. No hanging back. Swivels into a perfect position as he pulls a leg-side filth flat into the stands",Lockie Ferguson to Parthiv Patel,SIX

4600914,RPS 1st Inns,18.4,"McClenaghan to Dhoni, SIX, brings up the 50-run stand in style. Helped by a mediocre delivery of course. You don't bowl length to this guy. Dhoni waits on the back foot and biffs it high and over",McClenaghan to Dhoni,SIX
4600914,RPS 1st Inns,19.0,"McClenaghan to Dhoni, SIX, it's high and it is handsome as well. Not quite off the middle but Dhoni will collect another six. 26 runs off the over. Third time this season, McClenaghan has given more than 20 runs. Fullish ball outside off, Dhoni goes hard on his lofted off-drive. Rohit tried his best at long-off, but can't do much. He falls outside the boundary rope",McClenaghan to Dhoni,SIX
4600914,RPS 1st Inns,19.2,"Bumrah to Dhoni, SIX, that's a special shot! Back of a length delivery, Dhoni opened up the off-side by backing away. He generates massive power and biffs it over cover for a maximum",Bumrah to Dhoni,SIX

4600914,RPS 1st Inns,6.2,"Karn Sharma to Manoj Tiwary, SIX, comes down the track and lofts the ball over long-on. That is a much needed tonic to this innings which was starting to go nowhere. A slight movement down the ground and then the smacking hit",Karn Sharma to Manoj Tiwary,SIX

1206999,KKR 1st Inns,6.3,"Kulwant Khejroliya to Nitish Rana, SIX, crack made the sound, there! Shortish in length, Rana has had enough of those. Rocks back and pulls this nicely into the night sky, high and handsome, over mid-wicket for a biggie",Kulwant Khejroliya to Nitish Rana,SIX
1206999,RCB 1st Inns,0.4,"Vinay Kumar to Brendon McCullum, SIX, top edgeeee, but fine leg is inside the ring. Wouldn't have mattered though because it cleared the rope. Shortish from Vinay Kumar, McCullum goes for the pull and gets a thick edge, the bat swing is hard enough for the ball to have enough legs",Vinay Kumar to Brendon McCullum,SIX
1206999,RCB 1st Inns,10.0,"Kuldeep Yadav to de Villiers, SIX, dances down the pitch and threatens the cameraman on one of those tiers.

1206999,RCB 1st Inns,10.3,"Narine to de Villiers, SIX, this is what he does so well. Those small movements in the crease before the bowler delivers and that puts many bowlers off. This time he backed away and Narine followed him, de Villiers swept that high in the air and all the way over deep backward square leg",Narine to de Villiers,SIX
1206999,RCB 1st Inns,11.3,"Johnson to de Villiers, SIX, launcheddddd! AB in this form... wow. Fullish off-cutter outside off, de Villiers sizes it up and biffs it over mid-off. Sails into the stands",Johnson to de Villiers,SIX
1206999,RCB 1st Inns,12.4,"Chawla to Kohli, SIX, those wrists have carried this all the way for six. Magnificent timing. He wasn't to the pitch of it even after stepping out, but still went through with the flick over mid-wicket. Plenty of height on it, and enough distance too",Chawla to Kohli,SIX
1206999,RCB 1st Inns,14.1,"Nitish Rana to de Villiers, SIX, oh don't do that. Never do that. A half-tracker to de Villiers who chews it up and spits it over mid-wicket",Nitish Rana to de Villiers,SIX
1206999,RCB 1st Inns,19.1,"Vinay Kumar to Mandeep, SIX, full in the slot, Mandeep gets in position by clearing his front leg and then wallops it over wide long-on with a clean swing. Ordinary delivery from Vinay",Vinay Kumar to Mandeep,SIX
1206999,RCB 1st Inns,19.3,"Vinay Kumar to Mandeep, SIX, six more. 16 off the first 3 balls. Mandeep is taking serious toll of what is some very ordinary death bowling. Short of length delivery, neither here nor there. Mandeep camps back and bludgeons the pull away",Vinay Kumar to Mandeep,SIX
1206999,RCB 1st Inns,6.0,"Chawla to Brendon McCullum, SIX, advances and lofts the ball, the timing is good enough and the ball clears the long-on fence quite comfortably. It was the googly from Chawla but McCullum read it",Chawla to Brendon McCullum,SIX
1206999,RCB 1st Inns,9.5,"Kuldeep Yadav to de Villiers, SIX, that's not a bad ball at all from Kuldeep Yadav. Not easy to time the away spinning ball.

9131817,SRH 1st Inns,2.5,"D Kulkarni to Dhawan, SIX, Dhawan has not been at his best so far today, but this is a shot of highest class. Kulkarni pounds it short for the nth time - well outside off.

9131817,SRH 1st Inns,3.5,"Unadkat to Williamson, SIX, wow. Dispatched with authority. Supreme pull shot from the Kiwi skipper. Spots the short ball early, camps back and pulls it witheringly into the deep square leg stands",Unadkat to Williamson,SIX

5641860,CSK 1st Inns,11.0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Raina, SIX, that's what he was trying at the start of the over. Raina remains the key to this chase.

5641860,CSK 1st Inns,13.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Dhoni, SIX, outta here! This is what the Chepauk crowd have been waiting for more than two years - Dhoni at his best.

5641860,CSK 1st Inns,14.3,"Tom Curran to Billings, SIX, fabulous shot! To get such power behind that shot is incredible.

5641860,CSK 1st Inns,17.3,"A Russell to Billings, SIX, geez! Some skill that. He waited and waited, moved right across his stumps when Russell was about to deliver, crouched low and scooped the low full toss all the way over fine leg. The crowd find their voice again",A Russell to Billings,SIX
5641860,CSK 1st Inns,17.4,"A Russell to Billings, SIX, this is spectacular. It was the off-cutter on back of a length, Billings had moved away to the leg-side and was almost cramped for room, extended his arms and lofted it over long-on. It was more of a punch from the Englishman. Reminded me of the Kohli shot against Chris Woakes",A Russell to Billings,SIX
5641860,CSK 1st Inns,18.3,"Tom Curran to Billings, SIX, Billings is playing a gem here. He is getting the big hit at the right moment. The slower delivery and Billings was waiting for it with a crouched stance, gets underneath it and nails the pull over deep square leg",Tom Curran to Billings,SIX
5641860,CSK 1st Inns,19.1,"Vinay Kumar to Dwayne Bravo, no ball, SIX, terrible terrible start from Vinay Kumar. KKR owner Shah Rukh Khan affords a smile.

5641860,CSK 1st Inns,3.1,"Chawla to Rayudu, SIX, excellent use of the feet by Rayudu. Tossed up delivery on middle and Rayudu shimmies down the wicket to pump it over the bowler's head for a biggie, that came right off the meat and met the sightscreen on the full",Chawla to Rayudu,SIX
5641860,CSK 1st Inns,3.3,"Chawla to Rayudu, SIX, carnage continues! The crowd is loving this. Flighted delivery around off, Rayudu stands tall and chips it with ease right over covers, half a dozen more. These two are looking unstoppable",Chawla to Rayudu,SIX

5641860,KKR 1st Inns,0.5,"Chahar to Narine, SIX, Narine is off the mark with a six. I'm not surprised. Swings his bat hard and takes on the man at long-on.

5641860,KKR 1st Inns,1.0,"Chahar to Narine, SIX, wow! Six more and that's 18 off the opening over. Slightly fuller and got it to swing in a tad did Chahar. But, that doesn't bother Narine. He slightly backs away and clobbers it over cow corner",Chahar to Narine,SIX

5641860,KKR 1st Inns,17.1,"Watson to A Russell, SIX, just over Rayudu at deep cover and that's fifty for Russell, could Rayudu been further back, would have had a better chance at catching it.

RR win this 10 runs",Laughlin to Chris Morris,SIX
9944694,RR 1st Inns,16.1,"Chris Morris to Tripathi, SIX, length ball angling into middle, Tripathi lays into that slog-sweep on the up and sends that into the deep mid-wicket orbit for six!

9944694,RR 1st Inns,16.3,"Chris Morris to Buttler, SIX, length delivery outside off, Buttler puts his body-weight behind it and lofts that into the night sky, Maxwell at long-on tries to take that. Jumps sideways -- in an awkward enough shape already -- and ends up dropping it into the boundary. Think that was a six even if he had taken it; Maxwell was air-borne and well beyond the ropes.

9944694,RR 1st Inns,17.1,"Shami to Buttler, SIX, fuller one on off, Buttler gets low, makes room and throws his hands at that to loft that over long-off for six. Massive hit.

9944694,RR 1st Inns,3.4,"Chris Morris to Stokes, SIX, kaboooooom! He's got this off the meat, that's for sure. Fractionally short from Morris and Stokes doesn't even bother to go on the back foot.

9944694,RR 1st Inns,4.4,"Boult to Samson, SIX, cracking shot! Samson isn't wasting any time to get going and is happy to target the red-hot Boult who is breathing fire.

1505006,DC 1st Inns,8.3,"Markande to Roy, SIX, so much power on that. Was a tossed up delivery around off, Roy went down on his knee and smoked it flat over long-off, even a leaping Pollard near the fence couldn't take the catch",Markande to Roy,SIX

6298097,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"Rashid Khan to Nitish Rana, SIX, that's massive. Such sweetly it was timed. Picks the googly early, gets down on his knee and slog sweeps it over mid-wicket, high and handsome that was",Rashid Khan to Nitish Rana,SIX
6298097,KKR 1st Inns,9.3,"S Kaul to Chris Lynn, SIX, that's high, miles up in the air... Was the knuckle ball and Lynn went hard at it, towers it up towards long-off where Rashid settles underneath but goes for it only with his left hand, gets a bit on that and eventually parries it over the fence. Was a very tough chance that, difficult to spot those in the night sky",S Kaul to Chris Lynn,SIX
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,12.0,"A Russell to Shakib, SIX, woah, the ball has gone skimming over the third man boundary. Boy he hit this hard. Short and wide, a ferocious slash from Shakib. Gets all of it. Massive over in the context of the game - 16 off it. SRH back in control",A Russell to Shakib,SIX
6298097,SRH 1st Inns,14.3,"Shivam Mavi to Williamson, SIX, Williamson uses the pace of Mavi, all 140kph of it, and whips the pull away over long leg. What a brilliant shot.

6298097,SRH 1st Inns,19.0,"A Russell to Y Pathan, SIX, that will be it. The SRH dugout rises as Pathan pulls this short ball into the stands. SRH pull off their first win at the Eden Gardens",A Russell to Y Pathan,SIX

3552968,RCB 1st Inns,17.4,"Laughlin to Washington Sundar, SIX, parried over the ropes for six! Gowtham was standing around 5 yards inside the boundary, stretched his arm out while back-pedaling but never looked like taking it. May have been a different story had he been all the way back. Slower short of length delivery, sits up for Sundar who thwacks it down the ground",Laughlin to Washington Sundar,SIX
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,18.2,"Stokes to Washington Sundar, SIX, now carves this slower ball inside-out for six. Wow. Clean strike from Washington Sundar who picked the variation early and smoked it into the crowd. Brings the crowd to life",Stokes to Washington Sundar,SIX
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,7.2,"D Arcy Short to Kohli, SIX, smoked it! Kohli's one hand came off but then too he manages to get a six. One hand or two hands, doesn't matter. Was a floated delivery around off and Kohli towered it over long-on",D Arcy Short to Kohli,SIX
3552968,RCB 1st Inns,9.0,"Shreyas Gopal to Kohli, SIX, insult to injury! Missed on a wicket on the last ball and goes for a six on the very next ball. Shortish delivery, a half-tracker and Kohli pummels it over wide long-on for a towering six, that was huge again",Shreyas Gopal to Kohli,SIX

3552968,RR 1st Inns,10.1,"Washington Sundar to Samson, SIX, blimey, what a blow! Some momentum into the RR innings now. This was fired fuller around middle and leg, Samson held his shape and swung through the line. Sent it soaring over long-on for a biggie",Washington Sundar to Samson,SIX

3552968,RR 1st Inns,13.3,"Negi to Samson, SIX, hammered away! Samson is on the rampage now. Of course, half-trackers like these help as well. Was on the back foot in a jiffy and smashed the pull over deep mid-wicket",Negi to Samson,SIX
3552968,RR 1st Inns,15.1,"U Yadav to Samson, SIX, gobbles up the Free Hit! Umesh is having a horror day. This is a full toss on leg, Samson just shuffles a touch and mows it over deep mid-wicket. Deep into the crowd",U Yadav to Samson,SIX
3552968,RR 1st Inns,16.2,"Woakes to Samson, SIX, just over deep mid-wicket! Slower and a fraction short from Woakes, Samson sits on the back foot and went through with the pull shot.

3552968,RR 1st Inns,17.0,"Woakes to Buttler, SIX, deep into the crowd! Buttler has activated the beast mode, danger signs for RCB if they don't get him quickly.

3552968,RR 1st Inns,18.0,"Khejroliya to Samson, SIX, Samsonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn! What quality strokeplay! Fullish ball around middle and leg, Samson makes room by backing away lot and just goes through with the extension of the loft down the ground.

3552968,RR 1st Inns,18.4,"Woakes to Samson, SIX, hammered into long-on! Samson's merry ways continue. He is batting on another level now.

3552968,RR 1st Inns,19.2,"U Yadav to Tripathi, SIX, H-U-G-E! For a change, it's not Samson who hits a biggie. The young Tripathi joins in the fun now and boy, he has clubbed this almost into the top tier of the ground. Slower and fuller, tries to follow the batsman but Tripathi is equal to the task. Makes room and clubs it easily over long-on. The crowd had to take cover there",U Yadav to Tripathi,SIX
3552968,RR 1st Inns,19.4,"U Yadav to Samson, SIX, no stopping Samson here! As if he needed a Free Hit to hit them big. Very full from Yadav and Samson gets under it with ease, clubbed comfortably over long-off. Ho ho ho!!",U Yadav to Samson,SIX
3552968,RR 1st Inns,19.5,"U Yadav to Samson, SIX, this time over deep extra cover! Incredible stuff from Samson, it's been an exhibition from him this afternoon. Full and wide outside off, he just makes room to lift it over the sweeper cover fence for a boundary. Unstoppable!",U Yadav to Samson,SIX

3552968,RR 1st Inns,7.4,"Khejroliya to Samson, SIX, spots the length. It's that in-between one, and Samson makes it look worse. Swivels, pulls and heaves without bothering to keep it down. All brute",Khejroliya to Samson,SIX
2038781,CSK 1st Inns,13.2,"Barinder to Rayudu, SIX, finally a maximum! The asking rate is up high, the runs weren't flowing and Rayudu gets a much needed six.

2038781,CSK 1st Inns,14.3,"Ashwin to Dhoni, SIX, that's why he eats those dots. He knows he can make up for it big time. Flighted delivery on the leg stump, Dhoni gets down on one knee and slog-sweeps it from the middle of the bat over square leg",Ashwin to Dhoni,SIX

2038781,CSK 1st Inns,18.3,"Andrew Tye to Dhoni, SIX, smashedddd! Why are you not bowling slower balls Andrew Tye? Strange! Length ball, goodbye! You are asking for trouble. Dhoni actially felt some pain after launching this over deep mid-wicket",Andrew Tye to Dhoni,SIX

2038781,CSK 1st Inns,20.0,"Mohit Sharma to Dhoni, SIX, he's hit this all the way but it won't matter - full ball outside off stump, Dhoni lofts it to over long-off. KXIP have escaped home by 4 runs.

2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,17.2,"Dwayne Bravo to Nair, SIX, RJ runs across and palms it over the boundary rope. Hit his thumb - his bowling hand as well. Hope it's not serious. It was a full toss and Nair hacked it over mid-wicket. Jaddu covered a lot of distance and the momentum was taking him futher across. Stuck his left hand out, couldn't hold on, despite a jump",Dwayne Bravo to Nair,SIX
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,18.4,"SN Thakur to Ashwin, SIX, Vijay was waiting for the ball, but it goes over his head. A 62m six! Slightly wayward from Thakur.

2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,3.2,"Harbhajan to Gayle, SIX, drop-kicked! Gone for a sixer. The batsman goes with the turn and muscles the ball over long-off for a maximum. Gayle is up and away!!",Harbhajan to Gayle,SIX
2038781,KXIP 1st Inns,5.2,"Chahar to Gayle, SIX, that is into a parallel universe from the universe boss. Length ball was like a dead meat and Gayle picks the bones out of it. Over cow corner for a mighty six. That was poor bowling",Chahar to Gayle,SIX

2619288,DC 1st Inns,10.3,"Kuldeep Yadav to Maxwell, SIX, that's been palmed over the ropes! Mavi, the fielder. Was a slow, flighted delivery. Slightly too full, Maxwell goes hard on the lofted on-drive and doesn't time it too well. Mavi moved to his right and probably didn't time his jump well. Gets a hand, but that's been parried away. SIX",Kuldeep Yadav to Maxwell,SIX
2619288,DC 1st Inns,10.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Maxwell, SIX, back-to-back sixes. Quicker delivery, too straight as well, that's been bludgeoned over deep mid-wicket with a mighty swing of the bat",Kuldeep Yadav to Maxwell,SIX

2619288,KKR 1st Inns,1.4,"Chris Morris to Chris Lynn, SIX, off the mark with a six. That's what he can do. Can recover momentum and up the rate so quickly.

2619288,KKR 1st Inns,11.4,"Vijay Shankar to Karthik, SIX, DK knows all about Vijay Shankar. Both play together for Tamil Nadu, a step towards the ball and then swung it from his hips over deep backward square, was a back of a length delivery but such is the form that DK is in, he has hit it for six",Vijay Shankar to Karthik,SIX
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,13.5,"Chris Morris to Nitish Rana, SIX, length delivery outside off and Nitish Rana launches it over long-on. Clean bat-swing and the ball sails over the fielder's head. The wicket of his skipper hasn't put Nitish Rana off at all",Chris Morris to Nitish Rana,SIX
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,14.3,"Shami to A Russell, SIX, that is a magnificent shot. For a moment he was cramped by the short of length delivery into the body, but he adjusted at the last moment and slashed it into his team's dugout at the third man fence. Needed to get it fine and did so",Shami to A Russell,SIX
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,14.5,"Shami to A Russell, SIX, holds the pose. Take that Shami seems to say Russell. Overpitched and right in teeing off zone for Russell, who lofts ever so cleanly and sees the ball till the last moment as his eyes and the bat are transfixed at the target. It lands in the long-off stands. Someone take a pic of that, frame it and present it to Russell",Shami to A Russell,SIX
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,15.0,"Shami to A Russell, SIX, he is unreal. When it comes to hitting a cricket ball. The predictable short delivery arrives, with no pace or height, brutalised over mid-wicket. The Kolkatans have gone mental at the Eden",Shami to A Russell,SIX
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,15.1,"Chris Morris to Nitish Rana, SIX, now Nitish Rana gets into the act. Short ball and Nitish Rana pulls handsomely over deep mid. Looked like he was waiting on the back foot for that one and when it came, didn't miss out",Chris Morris to Nitish Rana,SIX
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,16.1,"Shami to A Russell, SIX, that is the flattest square-driven six you'll ever see. Trust me on that. Unbelievable stuff from Russell.

2619288,KKR 1st Inns,16.5,"Shami to A Russell, SIX, my word. There's so little margin of error against this beast from Jamaica. A man-mountain.

2619288,KKR 1st Inns,17.0,"Shami to A Russell, SIX, straight up in the air, can someone get under this one. What! It has landed over long-off's head. What does he have everyday? Just pass that to all those who want to put on weight. This is jaw-dropping stuff from Russell. Looked like he had pulled the short ball straight up in the air, but such is the power he possesses that it has landed beyond the boundary. What more can I say?",Shami to A Russell,SIX
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,5.2,"Nadeem to Uthappa, SIX, heaved over deep mid. Sliding on, on the middle and leg line, Uthappa sunk under that and clouted it high and over mid-wicket",Nadeem to Uthappa,SIX
2619288,KKR 1st Inns,5.4,"Nadeem to Uthappa, SIX, sheer power. That's all made in the gym. What a shot this is. Must be contending for one of the shots of the tournament so far. This is a length ball on off, Uthappa went back and used his forearm power to great effect as he flat-batted it dead straight back over the bowler. A flat six. Nadeem shouldn't feel too disheartened with that hit, it wasn't a bad ball by any stretch of the imagination",Nadeem to Uthappa,SIX

9886489,MI 1st Inns,10.3,"Chahal to Lewis, SIX, he's done waiting for something deft. He's down, running, Chahal's gone slower as well for some reason. Swings, big time, and it's more a miscue .. never mind when you've got hands like these. Way over long-off",Chahal to Lewis,SIX
9886489,MI 1st Inns,10.4,"Chahal to Lewis, SIX, typically dragged down. Lewis' smart, he sits, gets it in his slot and heave-sweeps. Checks the railway tracks behind square leg..the ball's there",Chahal to Lewis,SIX
9886489,MI 1st Inns,13.3,"Chahal to Krunal Pandya, SIX, connects. Cleanly at last. And then it's going only one way. Chahal tries a flipper, but Krunal with his shuffle gets under, sits under and dispatches it into long-on. Nothing subtle",Chahal to Krunal Pandya,SIX
9886489,MI 1st Inns,14.1,"U Yadav to Rohit, SIX, raw meat. That length, you are obliged to smack. Rohit smokes, swinging flat-batted, into the first tier over square leg",U Yadav to Rohit,SIX

9886489,MI 1st Inns,17.3,"Siraj to Rohit, SIX, wow. Okay Google - search for descriptions. Siraj errs for a change, letting the length sit up in Rohit arc .. and that arc's ever-expanding. Flat-bats, high and into long-on. Save your faces",Siraj to Rohit,SIX
9886489,MI 1st Inns,18.3,"Woakes to Hardik Pandya, SIX, feeds him a revenge gift. Short, on the body, and Pandya swivels, almost base-balling it into the second floor. Where else, but behind square",Woakes to Hardik Pandya,SIX
9886489,MI 1st Inns,18.4,"Woakes to Hardik Pandya, SIX, and now length. The cardinal length. Pandya rubbing it in and how. Holds his pose, lets the ball get close and clears long-off with his lofted shovel",Woakes to Hardik Pandya,SIX

9886489,MI 1st Inns,4.1,"Siraj to Lewis, SIX, welcome to the attack Mr.Siraj! Lewis is absolutely nonchalant as he dispatches this rubbish short ball way into the stands at deep backward square leg.

9886489,MI 1st Inns,7.2,"Washington Sundar to Rohit, SIX, down the pitch and bang! The MI skipper has decided to up the ante a little.

6071727,KKR 1st Inns,16.3,"Unadkat to Karthik, SIX, oh what a freebie, and what a time for it. Any pressure that had built on KKR has evaporated. Slower short ball on leg-stump, Karthik whip-pulls it witheringly over the long leg boundary",Unadkat to Karthik,SIX
6071727,KKR 1st Inns,16.5,"Unadkat to Nitish Rana, SIX, pretty full from Unadkat, and this is brilliant use of the crease from Rana. He takes a step back which allows him to get under the ball.

8353877,CSK 1st Inns,2.3,"Unadkat to Watson, SIX, Watto is off to a flier. Although he has been dropped twice, he's continuing to take on the bowlers. This was a length delivery around off, Watson stood tall and clobbered it over the extra cover fence for half a dozen more",Unadkat to Watson,SIX
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,3.0,"Unadkat to Watson, SIX, last ball of the over fetches six more. Unadkat wouldn't like this. He's the most expensive buy of this IPL among Indian players. Short of a length around off, Watson camps back and hammers it over mid-wicket for a flat six",Unadkat to Watson,SIX
8353877,CSK 1st Inns,8.2,"Gowtham to Watson, SIX, gets to his fifty in style! It's a short delivery and Watson camps back and slaughters it over Stokes at long-on. Reaches the milestone and raises his bat, acknowledges the crowd",Gowtham to Watson,SIX

4053491,KKR 1st Inns,12.2,"Andrew Tye to Chris Lynn, SIX, smashed, length delivery and Lynn is all over it like a rash. Lynn was waiting on it, plays with the angle and sends it high and deep into the stands at long-on, 103 m hit - the second longest of IPL 2018",Andrew Tye to Chris Lynn,SIX

7791285,DC 1st Inns,13.2,"Washington Sundar to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, fifty for Iyer. Gets there in style. First for him in this IPL. Needs to keep going though.

7791285,DC 1st Inns,15.4,"Chahal to Pant, SIX, fabulous shot! It was the wrong 'un and Pant seemed to have picked it from the hand, didn't try to go across the line, went straight and the boy packs a punch, cleared long-off with ease",Chahal to Pant,SIX

7710423,DC 1st Inns,16.1,"Barinder to Rahul Tewatia, SIX, that's a brilliant hit under pressure. Barinder, why did you run in and bowl a full ball in the slot? He followed Rahul Tewatia who was backing away, but landed perfectly for Tewatia to tee off over long-off",Barinder to Rahul Tewatia,SIX
7710423,DC 1st Inns,19.2,"Mujeeb to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, smashed, short and outside off stump, Shreyas flat-bats the loft over long-off. Fifty up for Shreyas Iyer, good knock but he needs to connect them well from here on",Mujeeb to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
7710423,DC 1st Inns,3.3,"Andrew Tye to Maxwell, SIX, that's flown away like it belongs to the stands. Full pace at 136ks and steaming into the pads, and Maxwell's just flunked it over backward square leg with a bat swing. Sounds easy, right?",Andrew Tye to Maxwell,SIX
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,15.3,"Mishra to Miller, SIX, downtown. Talk about rubbing it in. Two lives, and a celebration with a hoick straight down. All muscle, perbably denting the sightscreen",Mishra to Miller,SIX
7710423,KXIP 1st Inns,3.1,"Avesh Khan to Rahul, SIX, terrific stroke! Rahul is in some serious form and we've seen it already this season. Dug in short and angling into the body, he just shuffles across to get inside the line and uses the pace to control the pull. Easily over fine leg for a biggie",Avesh Khan to Rahul,SIX
6197357,MI 1st Inns,12.2,"Shakib to Pollard, SIX, full and right in KP's arc, he has no second thoughts. Just dismisses it out of his presence by using those long levers to full effect, sent into the galaxy. Over long-on",Shakib to Pollard,SIX
6197357,SRH 1st Inns,18.3,"Mustafizur to Y Pathan, SIX, a smile from KW after that big hit. On a length and around off, too predictable these cutters from Mustafizur, Pathan stays back and lofts cleanly miles into the stands at long-on",Mustafizur to Y Pathan,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,0.5,"Negi to Watson, SIX, that's Watson at his best. Too full and too straight, Watson sits down and then heaves with all his might, good connection to get it all the way over long-on. Gets the crowd going",Negi to Watson,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,11.5,"Corey Anderson to Dhoni, SIX, right in Dhoni's teeing off zone. Picks the slower delivery and murders it over long-on. As easy as you like",Corey Anderson to Dhoni,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,13.1,"Negi to Dhoni, SIX, helicoptered straight down the ground! Mini-helicopter you can call. Tossed up on middle, Dhoni marmalises it back over the bowler's head. Such power",Negi to Dhoni,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,13.2,"Negi to Dhoni, SIX, Negi continues to toss it up, too full and right in the hitting zone, Dhoni swings and sends it over long-on. When it is so full, Dhoni will hit everything out of the park",Negi to Dhoni,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,13.5,"Negi to Rayudu, SIX, 50 for Rayudu. He is getting tired and losing some of his power, but this he sits back and waits for it to be bowled short, then mauls the pull over deep mid. Third six of the over",Negi to Rayudu,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,14.3,"Siraj to Rayudu, SIX, magnificent shot. Down the track and lifts the back of a length delivery over deep cover. So effortless with so much timing. A crucial blow at the right time",Siraj to Rayudu,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,15.5,"Corey Anderson to Rayudu, SIX, back of a length outside off, Rayudu knows what is coming, a mini shuffle outside off, forehands it over wide long-off. Carries over the rope, not by much but it will do",Corey Anderson to Rayudu,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,16.0,"Corey Anderson to Rayudu, SIX, this is bigger. And longer. Full outside off, Rayudu shuffles across and gives it all, off the middle of the bat and way back into the stands. Nailed that and the ball flies away to the deep mid fence",Corey Anderson to Rayudu,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,17.2,"Corey Anderson to Dhoni, SIX, whyyy! When those back of a length balls were working so well, why do you want to try the yorker. Dhoni smacks it. He did really smack it straight down the ground. Fifty for the CSK captain, he's determined and as always confident",Corey Anderson to Dhoni,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,18.5,"Siraj to Dhoni, SIX, don't tell me he deliberately sliced that all the way for six! Oh he did! Genius! Low full toss outside off stump, not a really bad ball, Dhoni has been looking to target third man this innings and he's somehow got under this properly and sent it for a maximum",Siraj to Dhoni,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,19.2,"Corey Anderson to Dwayne Bravo, SIX, who better than DJ Bravo to hit those inside-out shots over cover. You got to admire him. Distraught RCB fans. Delight in the CSK camp. Back of a length delivery outside off stump, Bravo backs away and gets under the ball to smash it over cover",Corey Anderson to Dwayne Bravo,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,19.4,"Corey Anderson to Dhoni, SIX, that's it! How cool is he man! Is he human? CSK have won with two balls to spare! Unbelievable stuff. More than 100 runs were needed in about 7 overs but he never showed any signs of pressure, nor did he play rash shots. Just played his trumpcard of taking the match deep and backing himself to finish and boy, what a finish it was. Just a jump across to the off-side and slogs this full ball with all his might to clear deep mid-wicket. This is RCB's first loss defending in excess of 200 at the Chinnaswamy",Corey Anderson to Dhoni,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,2.3,"Washington Sundar to Rayudu, SIX, the sound of bat hitting ball was like a gunshot. Such a big hit and so well hit too. After not getting to the pitch, Washington Sundar seeing Rayudu come down, dragged it down, but Rayudu is seeing so well at the moment that he goes through with the pull and muscles it over deep mid",Washington Sundar to Rayudu,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,2.4,"Washington Sundar to Rayudu, SIX, good cricket awareness from Rayudu as he knew Washington Sundar will pitch it up, he does and Rayudu swings through the line and cleanly to get another six over long-on",Washington Sundar to Rayudu,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,3.1,"U Yadav to Rayudu, SIX, he is in the mood. For sure. A length ball angling in, Rayudu stays back and just whips that off his pads, knew there was no-one back out there, the white ball sails into the crowd at deep backward square",U Yadav to Rayudu,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,8.3,"Chahal to Rayudu, SIX, goes over deep cover. Rayudu didn't find it off the middle of the bat, but has got enough bat to send the ball soaring into the crowd over deep cover. Tough tough shot but Rayudu trusted his ability and played it supremely",Chahal to Rayudu,SIX
4793375,CSK 1st Inns,9.3,"Negi to Dhoni, SIX, crikey! We have seen everything from MS in this game. Never will play the big shot off just his second ball, but here he has done so and got six. Down the track to the tossed up delivery on leg, heaves into the deep mid fence. Off the mark with a biggie",Negi to Dhoni,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,10.3,"Tahir to de Villiers, SIX, there comes the sweep. He has got outside the line as he sits and then takes it from around fourth stump line, sweeps and connects beautifully, sends it into the deep backward square leg fence. The ball just flew off the bat",Tahir to de Villiers,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,10.4,"Tahir to de Villiers, SIX, the ball is lost! Find a new one. If someone is outside the stadium near the deep mid stands, they can take that as a souvenir. And frame it and keep it for posterity sake. de Villiers does a Guptill as he sits down and then does not keep his eyes on the shot, the head looks down and the eyes away from the line of where the ball is going, where's the ball? Over the roof at deep mid. One hit in the last game came back in from there, but this is isn't. Monster hit! My colleague Akshay tells me that it is a 111-metre six - the biggest of the tournament so far",Tahir to de Villiers,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,12.0,"Watson to de Kock, SIX, massive blow and de Kock likes that. Has 50 and points at the base of his bat to someone in the dressing room. All done with a smile on his face. Makes room and the length ball is clattered miles into the deep mid-wicket stands. More of a golf-swing that from de Kock",Watson to de Kock,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,12.1,"SN Thakur to de Villiers, SIX, now 50 for AB. Just a raise of the bat and a glove-punch with de Kock to celebrate getting there. Picks the slower delivery and heaves it into the deep mid stands. The key was standing still and then going through with the shot",SN Thakur to de Villiers,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,12.2,"SN Thakur to de Villiers, SIX, another slower delivery and another six. Predictable from Thakur. Again de Villiers stays so still, doesn't move around at all, over long-on now. Clean and beautiful",SN Thakur to de Villiers,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,12.3,"SN Thakur to de Villiers, SIX, Thakur isn't learning at all. Third slower delivery, this was the knuckle delivery, he is overdoing it, de Villiers may have seen what he is doing, even if he hasn't, can pick it from the hand, the slower delivery lands outside off and with a swing of the bat, the ball is seen flying over wide long-off. What can this man not do on a cricket field? Absolutely nothing",SN Thakur to de Villiers,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,15.3,"Jadeja to Mandeep, SIX, almost an unbelievable catch. Boult snatched one in the last game. Billings just missing out with an incredible effort. Slogged in the air from outside off and Billings on the run from deep mid, stretched his right-hand out at full tilt but took the ball with him beyond the ropes. Had he caught that, would've been one of the all-time great catches",Jadeja to Mandeep,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,18.1,"SN Thakur to Mandeep, SIX, brilliant shot. He is backing away and having to reach out but awesome timing on the lofted square drive. It was full and outside his reach, but somehow Mandeep got it over the deep point fence. All timing and the crowd have found their voice back",SN Thakur to Mandeep,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,18.5,"SN Thakur to Mandeep, SIX, bit of TR from Bumble. ""Mandeep, Mandeep, goes deep."" is his comment on air. Sheer power from Mandeep, waits for the shortish slower delivery, then flat-bats it with brute force and clears long-off easily. The key was knowing what Thakur will bowl and setting himself up for the shot. Perfectly executed",SN Thakur to Mandeep,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,19.4,"Dwayne Bravo to Washington Sundar, SIX, just over Tahir at deep mid. Washington Sundar slogging the slower delivery and managing to clear the leggie, when he hit it, looked like he holed out. Enough, just about to get a biggie",Dwayne Bravo to Washington Sundar,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,2.3,"Chahar to de Kock, SIX, mauls this slower delivery over long-on. Made slight room to the off-pace delivery and then freed his arms to go big. Connected cleanly and there was never a doubt about the hit",Chahar to de Kock,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,3.5,"Harbhajan to de Kock, SIX, de Kock has seen enough. Decides to take matters into his own hands. Such a difficult shot to play - against the spin to a turning ball, but de Kock nailed the shot to perfection. Down the track and to the pitch before hoisting it long over long-on. Again timed so well and it went way back into the stands",Harbhajan to de Kock,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,5.2,"Harbhajan to de Villiers, SIX, de Villiers wants to make an impact. Takes on long-on and goes over his head. Uses his feet and then a clean swing of the bat. Rest you know. Sails into the stands. So effortless",Harbhajan to de Villiers,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,5.4,"Harbhajan to de Villiers, SIX, he played an absolute beauty of a shot against Nadeem in the last game. Does the same here. Makes room and goes in-to-out - one of the toughest shots in the business but de Villiers is a genius, makes it look so simple. Over extra-cover and just crosses the ropes for six. The crowd have gone mad at the Chinnaswamy",Harbhajan to de Villiers,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,6.3,"Jadeja to de Villiers, SIX, wow. So easy this is for de Villiers that it is absolutely ridiculous. Other mortals would have attempted to drive that through cover, but when de Villiers saw that tossed up delivery outside off he went down on his knee and swept it flat over deep square leg. The fielder was behind square and could only watch the ball go into the cushions",Jadeja to de Villiers,SIX
4793375,RCB 1st Inns,9.2,"Dwayne Bravo to de Kock, SIX, straight back over Dwayne Bravo's head. Over the sightscreen. Picks the bones out of this slower delivery, stays till and smashes the ball for a biggie",Dwayne Bravo to de Kock,SIX
4782326,KXIP 1st Inns,1.2,"Nabi to Gayle, SIX, down the track he comes and clobbers it! Just a casual swing of the arms to send it rocketing back over the bowler's head",Nabi to Gayle,SIX

4782326,KXIP 1st Inns,3.3,"Nabi to Rahul, SIX, deep into the mid-wicket stands. He pounces on this short ball. Picks length up strikingly early, hops back and nails the pull away",Nabi to Rahul,SIX
4782326,KXIP 1st Inns,6.3,"Basil Thampi to Gayle, SIX, you brutal brutal beast. Clears his front leg and destroys this back of length delivery. It's gone soaring over long-on. Phew, enough to knock the wind out of a bowler",Basil Thampi to Gayle,SIX
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,15.0,"Ashwin to Manish Pandey, SIX, he's tonked this over mid-wicket. Finally the acceleration from Pandey. Picks the ball from outside off and slogs cleanly",Ashwin to Manish Pandey,SIX
4782326,SRH 1st Inns,17.3,"Ashwin to Y Pathan, SIX, another one goes down, albeit a much difficult one. Mistimed slog from Pathan, Manoj Tiwary skirts along the square leg boundary, and then tips it over the ropes. His mind was occupied by his proximity to the ropes which made him fluff the chance too",Ashwin to Y Pathan,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,1.5,"Kuldeep Yadav to Munro, SIX, smashed, that's a long hop from Kuldeep, it was the attempted wrong 'un, sat up to be smacked. Munro stayed back and flat-batted the pull, high and over long-on for a maximum",Kuldeep Yadav to Munro,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,11.1,"Kuldeep Yadav to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, ahh, the new DD captain doesn't think so. What a way to greet the mystery spinner in his new spell! Floated up around off, Iyer did well to go with the spin and executed the slog sweep beautifully. Easily over deep mid-wicket",Kuldeep Yadav to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,13.0,"Johnson to Prithvi Shaw, SIX, launched over square leg! Shaw continues in his merry ways. Fractionally short in length and he swivels a touch before propelling this with a strong bottom hand. In the air for quite a while and had enough legs to clear the fence. He is switching gears here, is Shaw and DD do need to up the ante. Looks a good batting surface",Johnson to Prithvi Shaw,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,13.1,"Chawla to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, that's H-U-G-E! Into the top tier! Whoa, what a strike! Iyer has decided to join in the fun as well. Tossed up nicely by Chawla and it's blasted high down the ground. One of those sixes that had good height and distance. Lovely",Chawla to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,15.0,"A Russell to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, absolutely bludgeoned! We have seen quite a bit of these flat-batted strokes tonight and this one from Iyer is another cracker. Shortish and outside off, he makes room a touch on the back foot and smears this over long-off. All the way",A Russell to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,16.4,"Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, chance goes down! Uthappa the man at long-on, don't think he would have managed to stay inside the ropes even if he caught this. Fuller ball and it was lofted down the ground by Iyer. Didn't quite get the elevation on it anc went flat. Luckily for him, just about manages to go for a biggie. Brings up the 50 for Iyer! What a way to start his IPL captaincy stint!",Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,16.5,"Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, scorching stroke! Iyer is going bonkers here. Expecting the shorter length and makes room before launching it over wide long-off. There was a fielder there but this was wider and higher as well. Back to back biggies for the skipper. He is having a ball on captaincy debut",Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,17.3,"Narine to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, dropped again! Rana is the man again and he fails to judge this skier well. Ends up tipping it over the ropes at long-on for a biggie. Floated up around middle, Iyer went for the lofted stroke down the ground and this went high up into the night sky before setting towards a confused Rana who ended up putting it down",Narine to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,18.0,"Narine to Maxwell, SIX, gets hold of this one! Finally, Maxwell has middled one and sends this way over long-on for a six. Huge strike!

6844921,DC 1st Inns,18.2,"Johnson to Maxwell, SIX, that's a flat hit! Tells you what one confident stroke can do. Maxwell is now striking them well. The short ball and he swivels to get inside the line before pulling over short fine leg. Clears the ropes as well",Johnson to Maxwell,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,19.1,"Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, high in the air....well over the fence! Booming stroke! Mavi isn't hitting the right length, fuller ball outside off and Iyer was already making room for the inside out stroke. Sends this into orbit with that bat swing of his",Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,19.2,"Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, makes no difference! It won't as well if he continues with this length, Mavi. Fullish attacking the sticks, Iyer just shuffles across a touch and sends this flying over deep mid-wicket for a biggie. Another six that had plenty of height on it. Two towering strikes! Perfect start to the over for DD",Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,19.4,"Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, massacred away! The Shreyas Iyer show continues. Full and in the slot, poor bowling and it's been punished as well. Shoveled away over deep mid-wicket for another huge six",Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,20.0,"Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, ends the innings in style! Take a bow, Shreyas Iyer! Phenomenal stuff!

DD end on 219/4!",Shivam Mavi to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,4.4,"Narine to Munro, SIX, lovely from Munro, he's showing why he's the number one T20I batsman in the world. This was tossed up on the stumps, Munro bent down on his knees and swept it high and over deep mid-wicket, deep into the crowd for a maximum",Narine to Munro,SIX
6844921,DC 1st Inns,8.5,"Johnson to Prithvi Shaw, SIX, the helicopter is out, MS will be proud of this shot. Length delivery on the stumps, Prithvi waits on it, then brings his wrists into play and flicks it stylishly over mid-wicket, all the way over the ropes",Johnson to Prithvi Shaw,SIX
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,1.1,"Maxwell to Narine, SIX, that ain't coming back. Woof! What.A.Strike.Sunil.Narine. Doesn't move an inch, keeps himself steady and lifts Maxwell high into the night sky. Way back over the sightscreen",Maxwell to Narine,SIX
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,11.5,"Avesh Khan to A Russell, SIX, thwack, thwack, thwack! That ball had wings. Infact Russell lent wings to it. Short delivery, sat up and the batsman thumped the ball away over mid-wicket for a maximum",Avesh Khan to A Russell,SIX
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,12.0,"Avesh Khan to A Russell, SIX, Russell will go down fighting. Correction - swinging.. That was short, at the body from round the wicket but Russell was ready. Opens his stance, and then muscles the ball over the on-side for a huge six. The second tier stand at deep square leg was peppered",Avesh Khan to A Russell,SIX
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,12.2,"Boult to A Russell, SIX, Ho ho! This man. Brute.. That was in the zone, pitched up and the batsman backed away to murder that over long-on. The Russell show has started. Bring on your crash helmets, folks!!",Boult to A Russell,SIX
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,14.2,"Rahul Tewatia to A Russell, SIX, inside out and it is a mighty one! Flighted well outside off and the batsman gave it more air-time by plundering the ball over covers. DD will start to sweat",Rahul Tewatia to A Russell,SIX
6844921,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Boult to Narine, SIX, pressure? Narine just doesn't know what that means. Sets himself up for a shorter length delivery, clears his front leg and goes tonkkkkkkk straight of long-off",Boult to Narine,SIX

7417775,CSK 1st Inns,15.3,"Markande to Dhoni, SIX, massacred over wide long-on. Again those hands. Down the track and then helicoptered miles into the crowd. The CSK crowd are sent into pangs of uncontrolled emotion. They are going wild",Markande to Dhoni,SIX
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,18.2,"Bumrah to Raina, SIX, my word. What a blow that is. The weight is on the back foot but he has powered this slower delivery over wide long-on. Looked like he had hit it straight up but it went all the way",Bumrah to Raina,SIX
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,20.0,"Hardik Pandya to Raina, SIX, Raina ends in style and takes six. Hardik Pandya and Rohit are disappointed. This is a fabulous shot.

7417775,CSK 1st Inns,4.3,"Krunal Pandya to Rayudu, SIX, how has Rayudu got that for six? Unbelievable wrists. Down the track and not to the pitch of this length delivery, but he trusts himself and then whips it in the air, Evin Lewis was the man circling under that at deep mid, but it kept sailing over him and then flies over the fence. Stunning batting by Rayudu",Krunal Pandya to Rayudu,SIX
7417775,CSK 1st Inns,5.0,"Krunal Pandya to Raina, SIX, second ball and Raina takes Krunal Pandya to the deep mid stands.

7417775,CSK 1st Inns,6.0,"Hardik Pandya to Rayudu, SIX, nothing edgy about this one. Full on off, a clean bat swing from Rayudu and the white ball soars into the long-off stands. Great end to the powerplay for CSK and Rayudu",Hardik Pandya to Rayudu,SIX

7417775,CSK 1st Inns,9.5,"Markande to Raina, SIX, beautiful shot this. Uses his feet and then goes over long-on after getting to the pitch. Hardik was there at long-on but he was left a spectator by the timing on that blow. The CSK WAGS are up and celebrating",Markande to Raina,SIX
7417775,MI 1st Inns,10.2,"Tahir to Lewis, SIX, carves this googly high and mighty over extra cover. Probably a bit too predictable from the leggie. This is what he was doing against Lewis in the entire last over. This time Lewis anticipates it, sizes it up and smokes it",Tahir to Lewis,SIX
7417775,MI 1st Inns,10.5,"Tahir to Lewis, SIX, my word, what power down the ground. Short from Tahir, Lewis thwacks it straight back over long-on. It's off the back foot too. Stunning",Tahir to Lewis,SIX
7417775,MI 1st Inns,13.1,"Watson to Rohit, SIX, lofted for six with one hand. How well has he timed this. It appeared that Rohit might have been beaten for the lack of pace and was into the loft too early, evidenced by his bottom hand coming off. But mid-off was up, so he had the confidence to go through with it. Ends up getting it right off the middle",Watson to Rohit,SIX
7417775,MI 1st Inns,13.4,"Watson to Rohit, SIX, wow, what execution! Gets right under this full ball and lap-sweeps it all the way over short fine leg. Just never looks hurried at all. Quickly took a step across, got down low and again, lovely timing",Watson to Rohit,SIX
7417775,MI 1st Inns,17.4,"Watson to Hardik Pandya, SIX, misses his length big time and Pandya laaaaaunches into it. It's a monstrous six over long-on. Probably aimed for the yorker there but ended up bowling right in Pandya's slot. Disappears",Watson to Hardik Pandya,SIX
7417775,MI 1st Inns,5.4,"SN Thakur to Suryakumar Yadav, SIX, wow! That's delicious. The bottom hand power, my goodness. Was a full ball on the pads, Yadav just walked across and flicked it over deep backward square leg. Top shot",SN Thakur to Suryakumar Yadav,SIX

7130109,SRH 1st Inns,11.2,"Unadkat to Williamson, SIX, Fab stuff. Goes downtown. Moved across a bit, with a clean swing of the bat lifted it nonchalantly over mid-off. Such is the timing that it went sailing all the way for a maximum",Unadkat to Williamson,SIX

8980712,KKR 1st Inns,10.2,"Chahal to Uthappa, SIX, Uthappa's looking ominous. He sizes up this overpitched delivery, gets his front leg out of the way and swings through the line. Clean six into the sightscreen",Chahal to Uthappa,SIX
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,12.0,"U Yadav to Uthappa, SIX, smashes this into the crowd. 143kph, short of length around the waist, Uthappa treats it with disdain. He belts it away from his presence. Gee that flew off the bat",U Yadav to Uthappa,SIX
8980712,KKR 1st Inns,18.2,"Siraj to Karthik, SIX, puts the seal on it. Crushing blow from Dinesh Karthik. He's offered a good length ball from Siraj, sets himself up and drills it over mid-off. Just over the ropes",Siraj to Karthik,SIX

Full and in the slot, Kohli unleashes the short-arm jabbed flick that sends the ball over the crowd. We saw MSD do that against Negi in the last game, but this is trademark Kohli.

That's all one can say",A Russell to Kohli,SIX
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,19.3,"Johnson to de Grandhomme, SIX, missed the yorker and goes for six. Turns out to be a slower delivery, de Grandhomme sits down and slices it over the sweeper, gets enough on it to go all the way. Kohli likes it and roars 'come on'",Johnson to de Grandhomme,SIX
8980712,RCB 1st Inns,20.0,"Johnson to Kohli, SIX, six to end. Shuffles across and inside the line, too predictable, slower delivery again, Kohli swings it to the deep backward square leg fence. No-one there and anyway it has the legs to go over the fence. RCB end with 175",Johnson to Kohli,SIX

5715249,CSK 1st Inns,4.3,"Plunkett to Watson, SIX, short ball, journey ball! That has gone into the stands. The batsman does not bother to go on the back foot and pulls it off the front foot.

5715249,CSK 1st Inns,4.4,"Plunkett to Watson, SIX, pick up off the pads. And the spectators pick it in the stands.

5715249,CSK 1st Inns,5.0,"Plunkett to du Plessis, SIX, Faf now rubs more salt into the bleeding wounds of Plunkett. Shuffles across and shovels the ball away over fine leg for a sixer. Pretty much like the last game here, there is a lot of carry",Plunkett to du Plessis,SIX
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,5.2,"Avesh Khan to Watson, SIX, top-edge! Six! Gosh! Over long-on. That was unbelieveable. The short ball, the batsman seemed to be slightly late on it and the ball flew away over long-on fence. Incredible",Avesh Khan to Watson,SIX

5715249,DC 1st Inns,18.4,"Dwayne Bravo to Vijay Shankar, SIX, short ball and smashed. Back-to-back sixes. Why didn't you do this when Pant was going great guns? Would have been of great help.

5715249,DC 1st Inns,19.0,"Dwayne Bravo to Vijay Shankar, SIX, and another one, clean hits, but the intent should have been there earlier for DD to have a real chance.

5715249,DC 1st Inns,4.5,"KM Asif to Munro, SIX, Asif getting some pasting from Munro here. 14 runs off the last three balls. The intent was fine but the execution went haywire. Banged it short, no purpose on it and allowed Munro to free his arms. Arched his back slightly and ramped it over the cordon. More off the edge but it went flat and hit the ad cushions on the full. They checked with the third umpire and it was confirmed on the replays",KM Asif to Munro,SIX

3981825,MI 1st Inns,9.2,"Hardik Pandya to Brendon McCullum, no ball, SIX, my word. What was that from Hardik Pandya? Must have slipped out of the hand.

2353730,RR 1st Inns,9.3,"Maxwell to D Arcy Short, SIX, quicker delivery outside off, D Arcy Short was deep in the crease, connection was terrific and ball sails into the crowd. Bludgeoned over long-off",Maxwell to D Arcy Short,SIX
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,10.0,"Kuldeep Yadav to Watson, SIX, Watson flexes his muscles and tonks one straight over Kuldeep's head for a maximum. Thrown well outside off, Watson fetches it from there after bending low and slammed it beautifully straight down the ground. Ruins a good over from Kuldeep",Kuldeep Yadav to Watson,SIX
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,15.5,"Shivam Mavi to Dhoni, SIX, too many short deliveries and MS puts one into the stands. Was getting too predictable there. Shortish in length around off, Dhoni picks it up early and deposits a flat six over the mid-wicket fence. Sweet sound on that blow",Shivam Mavi to Dhoni,SIX
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,16.2,"Johnson to Dhoni, SIX, that's a flat six again. Short of a length on leg, Dhoni swivels quickly and pulls it to perfection over the square leg boundary. That went to the fence at the speed of light, none of the fielders had any time to even react",Johnson to Dhoni,SIX
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,16.5,"Johnson to Dhoni, SIX, that's high. That's handsome. On a length on middle and leg, Dhoni stays put and towers this over long-on for six more. Rinku Singh at the fence was just a mere spectator. The crowd is loving this, when MS is in such form everybody does!",Johnson to Dhoni,SIX
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,17.5,"Kuldeep Yadav to Dhoni, SIX, dropped! How costly will that dropped catch prove to be? Was a shortish delivery around off, Dhoni pulled it hard to deep square leg where Gill lets it through his palms. Tried to reverse cup it and made a mess of it",Kuldeep Yadav to Dhoni,SIX
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,4.4,"Johnson to du Plessis, SIX, du Plessis is looking in fine touch. Sees a short ball, backs away and gets under it to smoke it over deep backward square leg stands. Into the crowd",Johnson to du Plessis,SIX
6347542,CSK 1st Inns,5.0,"Johnson to Watson, SIX, proper pasting for Johnson in this over. 19 runs off it and just the momentum CSK were looking for. Went short, no real threat behind it. Watson swivels across, taking his eyes off the ball and pulls it over short fine leg. Sweet timing and it flies all the way for a maximum",Johnson to Watson,SIX
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,0.3,"Lungi Ngidi to Chris Lynn, SIX, into the stands and the crowd are on their feet. Picks the length early on this short one and swivels quickly to pull that over square leg. Was on to his pull in a flash on that occasion",Lungi Ngidi to Chris Lynn,SIX
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,0.4,"Lungi Ngidi to Chris Lynn, SIX, back-to-back sixes for Lynn. This was a full length delivery on middle, Lynn stayed rooted and timed his loft right over the bowler. Straight as an arrow and over the boundary ropes",Lungi Ngidi to Chris Lynn,SIX
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,1.4,"KM Asif to Narine, SIX, that's the first one by Narine tonight. Was a shortish delivery around off and Narine cleared his front leg to club it nonchalantly over long-on",KM Asif to Narine,SIX
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,14.1,"KM Asif to Shubman Gill, SIX, that's a stunning shot! That's gone a long way back. His highest score in IPL. Picked the length (short) early, got into a good position on the back foot and muscled the pull over deep square leg. Right off the meat of the bat. Picked it up beautifully",KM Asif to Shubman Gill,SIX
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,14.4,"KM Asif to Shubman Gill, SIX, excellent effort from Rayudu, gets a hand on it, but can only parry it over the cushions. Short ball on off, quick hands from Gill who upper-cuts it behind square. Rayudu sprints across to his right from third man and flew with his right hand out to pluck, in vain",KM Asif to Shubman Gill,SIX
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,15.0,"KM Asif to Karthik, SIX, 21 off the over and the asking rate has come down to 7.4. KKR are surely the favourites now. The inexperienced Asif bangs one short, but slightly errs in line. Leg-stumpish and Karthik takes heavy toll of it. Walks across and helps it along its way with a hook over fine leg",KM Asif to Karthik,SIX
6347542,KKR 1st Inns,6.2,"Jadeja to Narine, SIX, Narine won't hang around blocking. Definitely not against a left-arm spinner. Was bulleted on off, Narine stood tall and smoked it over cow corner. Swung hard",Jadeja to Narine,SIX
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,0.5,"McClenaghan to Rahul, SIX, lovely, Rahul has been in sensational form this IPL and this was a gift from McClenaghan, full and wide of off, lets Rahul free his arms and lift it high and over cover, into the first tier of the stands",McClenaghan to Rahul,SIX

3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,12.1,"Krunal Pandya to Yuvraj, SIX, vintage Yuvi! Greets Krunal to the crease with a maximum. Floated up in the swinging arc for him, Yuvraj gets under it and smokes it into the deep mid-wicket stands. Too easy",Krunal Pandya to Yuvraj,SIX
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,13.4,"Cutting to Nair, SIX, whack! Too predictable lengths from Cutting. The slower ball, tad shorter. Nair picked it up early, employs his strong bottom-hand into play to muscle it over deep mid-wicket, clears the rope for a maximum",Cutting to Nair,SIX
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,14.2,"Markande to Axar, SIX, Axar decides to have some fun. Markande overdoes the flight here. Feeds it full and in the slot for Axar, who flexes his arms and tonks it a long way into the long-on stands",Markande to Axar,SIX
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,15.2,"McClenaghan to Nair, SIX, wowza! Nair sends one into the first tier. Poor delivery from McClenaghan, short without any purpose. Nair moves across his sticks, gets under it and hammers it behind square on the leg-side. Wonderful!",McClenaghan to Nair,SIX
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,17.5,"Cutting to Mayank Agarwal, SIX, in the airrr and just clears a leaping Rohit. A handy six for Agarwal and Punjab.

3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,19.1,"Hardik Pandya to Stoinis, SIX, ""That's the 500th six of the tournament,"" informs Sanjay Manjrekar on air. Hardik offers a full ball in the slot, Stoinis sets up a solid base of off and launches it over long-off",Hardik Pandya to Stoinis,SIX
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,19.5,"Hardik Pandya to Stoinis, SIX, awful from Hardik. Cannot bowl short with third man inside the ring. Stoinis knew the fielder was in, so went back and ramped it over short third man. Such is the timing that it went all the way for a maximum",Hardik Pandya to Stoinis,SIX
3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,5.2,"McClenaghan to Gayle, SIX, massive, Gayle has sent this ball into the roof of the Holkar Stadium.

3529537,KXIP 1st Inns,8.4,"Markande to Gayle, SIX, huge and that's into the top tier of the ground, too full and too wide from Markande, Gayle gets underneath the ball and sends it soaring - high and over cover for a maximum",Markande to Gayle,SIX
3529537,MI 1st Inns,10.5,"Ashwin to Ishan Kishan, SIX, muscled away! Much-needed release stroke for Kishan. He was crawling along and this should help. Fired flat and on a good length, Kishan was down on one knee in a flash and slog swept hard. Flat over deep square leg for a biggie. Nicely struck",Ashwin to Ishan Kishan,SIX
3529537,MI 1st Inns,12.0,"Stoinis to Ishan Kishan, SIX, helps it away for a biggie! Stoinis spoils the over with a short ball around leg stump, doesn't rise enough to threaten Kishan who swivels to just control the pull.

3529537,MI 1st Inns,12.5,"Mujeeb to Ishan Kishan, SIX, that's gone deep into the crowd! Best over of the chase thus far and MI needed this to be fair. Mujeeb is under pressure now.

3529537,MI 1st Inns,14.2,"Mujeeb to Hardik Pandya, SIX, dumped into the stands! Hardik Pandya has been promoted to up the ante and he is at it. Makes a hint of room and gets a fuller ball in his arc, smokes it into orbit at long-on. Powerful hit!",Mujeeb to Hardik Pandya,SIX
3529537,MI 1st Inns,16.1,"Mujeeb to Rohit, SIX, this will help MI! The skipper tees off and clears the fence with ease. Fullish and in the slot, flatter trajectory helped Rohit as he clubbed it dead straight over the bowler's head. Lovely placement too as you cannot have a fielder there. Not that it would have mattered",Mujeeb to Rohit,SIX
3529537,MI 1st Inns,17.0,"Mujeeb to Rohit, SIX, what a gigantic strike! Rohit is in the mood tonight, that's for sure. Shuffles a tad across the stumps and gets a fuller ball closer his arc.

3529537,MI 1st Inns,18.0,"Stoinis to Krunal Pandya, SIX, M-A-S-S-I-V-E! What a blow by Krunal! This over has most certainly sealed the game for Mumbai. Excellent hitting under pressure from these two. Stoinis errs on the fuller side once more and feeds it right where Krunal was wanting it. He backed away, cleared his front leg and deposited it over long-on for a mammoth six",Stoinis to Krunal Pandya,SIX
3529537,MI 1st Inns,18.3,"Andrew Tye to Krunal Pandya, SIX, he has absolutely blasted this away! Krunal is hitting them with such ferocity and also clearing the fence by some margin as well.

3529537,MI 1st Inns,2.0,"Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav, SIX, over Mayank's ambitious one-handed leap at deep square leg! Was pulled away by Suryakumar Yadav. Short and at 132ks isn't going to threaten him on this pitch. So he swivels, without bothering to keep the shot down and gets it all the way",Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav,SIX
3529537,MI 1st Inns,3.2,"Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav, SIX, that's been picked up like a bestseller on the shelf. Length on the pads and Suryakumar Yadav's lovely wrists come into play. Whipped all the way over deep square",Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav,SIX
3529537,MI 1st Inns,9.3,"Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav, SIX, going...going...going..GONE! That was in the nightsky for an eternity and yet had enough distance to go deep into the crowd. Clean hit!

2716679,CSK 1st Inns,10.0,"Siraj to Shorey, SIX, that ruins the over. Tries to scare the debutant with a short delivery, but Shorey has made a clean connection with the hook shot, got inside the line and used the pace on the ball to place it over fine leg",Siraj to Shorey,SIX
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,15.2,"Murugan Ashwin to Dwayne Bravo, SIX, that should relieve the pressure off Bravo, a rank long hop from Ashwin, Bravo rocks back and nails the pull over wide long-on, went a long way over the ropes",Murugan Ashwin to Dwayne Bravo,SIX
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,17.2,"Chahal to Dhoni, SIX, massive, that should seal this match. This was the wrong 'un from Chahal, Dhoni spots it early, gets a big stride forward, plays with the turn and smashes it high and over deep mid-wicket",Chahal to Dhoni,SIX
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,17.3,"Chahal to Dhoni, SIX, that should be it, this was tossed up well outside off, Dhoni gets forward and thumps it high towards long-on, didn't get hold of the shot, Kohli at long-off was kept interested, but in the end - the ball sailed over his head",Chahal to Dhoni,SIX

2716679,CSK 1st Inns,2.2,"U Yadav to Rayudu, SIX, that is what pace brings. Rayudu is hardly in control of the pull shot, but the ball has sailed away for a maximum. Rushed the batsman with a short ball and the top-edge flies over the CSK dugout",U Yadav to Rayudu,SIX
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,5.4,"Southee to Rayudu, SIX, wrong length from Southee. The off-cutter is landed short of length, sat up for Rayudu, who gave it his all to smash the pull over mid-wicket, the in-form batsman has broken the shackles for the home side",Southee to Rayudu,SIX
2716679,CSK 1st Inns,6.4,"Siraj to Raina, SIX, that's the pressure releaser. Needed a boundary or something to get himself going. Backed away to leg and got the length delivery right in his arc, swung it away over long-on. Not quite off the middle but still had enough",Siraj to Raina,SIX
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,18.2,"SN Thakur to Southee, SIX, mighty blow from Southee. So this is why he is denying the single on offer. Backing himself to club a few and does so this time in style. Slightly short and slow from Shardul, pulled away over deep square leg after a slight shuffle. Handy runs these",SN Thakur to Southee,SIX
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,3.0,"Willey to Parthiv Patel, SIX, he's hit this all the way over long-on. Backs away and makes some room whilst doing so, meaning he could pump the ball away even though Willey was bringing it in wide of the crease",Willey to Parthiv Patel,SIX
2716679,RCB 1st Inns,5.2,"Lungi Ngidi to Parthiv Patel, SIX, read the cutter nicely here. Shifted just outside the line of the ball, which is on middle-stump say, and picked it up -- all the way! -- over backward square",Lungi Ngidi to Parthiv Patel,SIX
4811184,DC 1st Inns,1.3,"Sandeep Sharma to Prithvi Shaw, SIX, that's a beautiful shot.

4811184,DC 1st Inns,12.4,"Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, rubbing salt on the wounds. Flighted ball outside off, Iyer goes inside out and chips it to perfection over wide long-off. The fielder tried hard, but the ball just cleared the fence",Rashid Khan to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
4811184,DC 1st Inns,19.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Vijay Shankar, SIX, this should ease Shankar's nerves. Much-needed hit for DD. Bhuvneshwar overdoes it; full and outside off, Shankar lines up and smacks it with ferocity over long-on",Bhuvneshwar to Vijay Shankar,SIX
4811184,DC 1st Inns,2.1,"Shakib to Prithvi Shaw, SIX, greets Shakib with a glorious shot. Tossed up delivery outside off, Shaw leans forward and times his chip over covers for six more, that's his second one of the night",Shakib to Prithvi Shaw,SIX
4811184,DC 1st Inns,5.3,"S Kaul to Prithvi Shaw, SIX, he's picking those slower deliveries, those knuckle balls to perfection. This was a full one outside off and Shaw simply smoked it over long-off. Third one of the night for him, he's approaching another fifty",S Kaul to Prithvi Shaw,SIX
4811184,DC 1st Inns,8.2,"Shakib to Shreyas Iyer, SIX, that's into the stands! Iyer joins the party, scores his first maximum of the night. Gets to the pitch of the ball and sends it sailing over the man at long-on for a perfectly timed six",Shakib to Shreyas Iyer,SIX
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,15.5,"Avesh Khan to Williamson, SIX, superb shot! Bouncer well outside off, a slight move across from Williamson, followed by an upper cut over third man.

4811184,SRH 1st Inns,18.1,"Boult to Y Pathan, SIX, that's a massive hit! Picked the slower ball, was in his slot, and then butchered it over long-on. Fullish and misses his yorker. 22 off 11 now",Boult to Y Pathan,SIX
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,19.2,"Christian to Y Pathan, SIX, oh, Christian, what have you done. A full toss and gets the treatment it deserved.

4811184,SRH 1st Inns,5.1,"Avesh Khan to Dhawan, SIX, bang! ""Don't ball short to me,"" seemed like the body language of Dhawan. Knew what was coming, was ready on the back foot as he muscled it way back into the deep square leg stands",Avesh Khan to Dhawan,SIX
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,5.3,"Avesh Khan to Hales, SIX, no respite for Avesh whatsoever. Tests Alex with a short ball, much like Hales he gets under it and blasts the pull over the mid-wicket fence",Avesh Khan to Hales,SIX
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,5.4,"Avesh Khan to Hales, SIX, this is turning out to be an expensive over for DD. Went full outside off, Hales jumped across and lifted it over mid-off. Not off the sweet spot but enough to take it all the way for a maximum",Avesh Khan to Hales,SIX
4811184,SRH 1st Inns,6.0,"Avesh Khan to Hales, SIX, 27 runs off the over. Avesh has been taken to the cleaners. Drops it short on seeing Hales move to leg. Hales throws it bat and smashes it over the in-field on the off-side. Sails over the ropes by a few inches. Just the momentum SRH needed at the end of Powerplay",Avesh Khan to Hales,SIX
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,18.2,"Bumrah to Karthik, SIX, what about the height on this full toss? Looked like it was below the waist. This time Karthik makes hay. Slogs it over deep mid-wicket, where Milne is trying to catch that one-handed and leaping. Well over him",Bumrah to Karthik,SIX
2957424,KKR 1st Inns,5.0,"McClenaghan to Nitish Rana, SIX, short, wide and six, the plan was to bowl short at Rana, McClenaghan had a backward point and a fielder square at point, but this was too short and too wide.

2957424,KKR 1st Inns,6.3,"Krunal Pandya to Uthappa, SIX, beautifully played, he pre-empted that Krunal was flighting this one, backed away, gets underneath the length and lifts it back over the bowler, clears the sightscreen and it's Uthappa's first maximum",Krunal Pandya to Uthappa,SIX

2957424,MI 1st Inns,16.4,"Narine to Krunal Pandya, SIX, Narine became a bit predictable there. Bowling offies on back of a length, Pandya waited back in the crease and then slotted the heave over wide long-on. Enough legs to carry over the rope",Narine to Krunal Pandya,SIX
2957424,MI 1st Inns,18.2,"Narine to Duminy, SIX, Duminy needs to kick on here. He knew what Narine was doing - bowling back of a length, so he moved across his sticks and muscled the pull over deep mid-wicket. Had to manufacture all the power and he got enough to clear the man",Narine to Duminy,SIX
2957424,MI 1st Inns,2.2,"Johnson to Suryakumar Yadav, SIX, in the air and goes all the way! The man in the deep was interested, but the ball goes well over his head. The bouncer from Johnson and Suryakumar Yadav was hurried by the pace. Still goes with the pull shot and gets a fat top-edge. Had enough wood to clear deep backward square leg",Johnson to Suryakumar Yadav,SIX
2957424,MI 1st Inns,4.5,"Prasidh to Lewis, SIX, nicely done! If Lewis gets going, it'll be tough to stop him. Krishna pounds in a shortish delivery. Lewis is expecting that. Stays back in his crease and pulls it over backward square leg with a swivel. First six for the West Indian",Prasidh to Lewis,SIX
2957424,MI 1st Inns,5.1,"Chawla to Lewis, SIX, my goodness! That was absolutely murdered. A juicy loopy full toss upfront from Chawla. There is no way Lewis was missing that. Moves slightly off-side and clouts it over deep square leg. That's colossal",Chawla to Lewis,SIX
2957424,MI 1st Inns,6.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Suryakumar Yadav, SIX, good use of the feet from Suryakumar Yadav.

Clean strike",Kuldeep Yadav to Suryakumar Yadav,SIX
7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,10.3,"Anureet Singh to Nair, SIX, drifts it on leg-stump and that's been handsomely picked up over long leg. Cross-seamed and skidding on, so Nair had the pace to work with",Anureet Singh to Nair,SIX
7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,13.5,"Shreyas Gopal to Stoinis, SIX, connects well this time! Stoinis was getting foxed a bit and decides to transfer the pressure right back on the bowler.

7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,16.4,"Jofra Archer to Rahul, SIX, that's gone all the way! What a shot! That too under pressure! Mind you this shortish length ball clocked 145kph but that's also what aided Rahul here. He stays back and upper cuts it over short third man. Deep into the crowd. Just the over KXIP wanted to ease a few nerves in the dug out. What a way to get to fifty! Top knock but he knows that the job isn't done yet",Jofra Archer to Rahul,SIX
7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,17.3,"Unadkat to Rahul, SIX, he is in a hurry to finish this off now, is Rahul. Probably not interested in taking this deep.

7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,18.2,"Jofra Archer to Rahul, SIX, stand and deliver stuff! Poetry in motion, this shot. Length ball alright but look at the way it's been put away by Rahul.

7442279,KXIP 1st Inns,9.5,"Shreyas Gopal to Nair, SIX, Nair doesn't reach the pitch of the ball but he still goes through with the shot and connects well. It was a flighted delivery at the stumps, Nair comes down the track and lofts it over cover with the turn for a six. He hit it inside-out, one of the hardest shots to execute. Ball hit the ropes on the full and umpires are confirming it",Shreyas Gopal to Nair,SIX
7442279,RR 1st Inns,6.3,"Ashwin to Samson, SIX, Samson likes it there, no spin and slightly short, he sends it into the orbit over wide long-on. So easy. Just makes batting look so simple this lad",Ashwin to Samson,SIX

9002051,SRH 1st Inns,14.0,"U Yadav to Williamson, SIX, what a waste of an extra ball and Williamson is too good a player to let that full-toss sliding down leg go. Nonchalantly whips and leaves deep backward square a spectator. Sailed over his head and that's a good over for SRH",U Yadav to Williamson,SIX
9002051,SRH 1st Inns,14.2,"Chahal to Williamson, SIX, that's a beautiful shot. Class from Williamson. Tossed up leggie outside off, too full and he has knelt down and slog-swept it flat over deep mid. Consecutive maximums for the SRH skipper",Chahal to Williamson,SIX
9002051,SRH 1st Inns,18.3,"Siraj to Saha, SIX, smashed. Saha backs away and clatters the half-volley on the stumps back over the head of Siraj, flat hit and it went all the way. Power from the diminutive Saha",Siraj to Saha,SIX

9958794,RCB 1st Inns,9.5,"Mishra to de Villiers, SIX, that's the bowler getting greedy with the turn on offer and offering a freebie. Way too full, the length is still acceptable, but the line is way outside off stump, got to be closer to the sticks. AB just waited for it and smashed that lofted drive over extra-cover",Mishra to de Villiers,SIX
7242907,CSK 1st Inns,1.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Watson, SIX, Bhuvneshwar goes short and Watson dispatches it over long-on. Went back and flat-batted it disdainfully. The key was - he picked the length early",Bhuvneshwar to Watson,SIX
7242907,CSK 1st Inns,10.3,"S Kaul to Rayudu, SIX, gee there's a lot of audaciousness with the way he bats. He knows Kaul way too well. Two short balls first up in the over, but expects Kaul to try another one, the bowler dished out exactly what the batsman wanted and that back and across movement from Rayudu makes a strong statement that he is bossing the show, out comes the pull shot and clears deep mid-wicket. Brilliant fifty",S Kaul to Rayudu,SIX
7242907,CSK 1st Inns,11.2,"Rashid Khan to Rayudu, SIX, has he sliced this? Yes he has, but that bat in his hands is very good and it takes the ball all the way. The leggie outside off stump, Rayudu gets down on one knee and goes hard at it, looked like it was going to long-off for a moment, but this isn't Uppal. The boundaries are smaller",Rashid Khan to Rayudu,SIX
7242907,CSK 1st Inns,12.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu, SIX, this is precisely why SRH need Rayudu ASAP! Just look at him run down at SRH's key bowler. Got beaten previous ball, but no respect whatsoever and he forces Bhuvi to shorten the length, with it swings across the line with a pull and powers it over the mid-wicket boundary. He's just toying with them",Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu,SIX
7242907,CSK 1st Inns,13.1,"Shakib to Rayudu, SIX, oh my god! This guy is playing some outrageous shots. Flighted delivery from Shakib, Rayudu steps out, gets closer to the pitch of the ball and slogs it hard over deep mid-wicket",Shakib to Rayudu,SIX
7242907,CSK 1st Inns,15.5,"Shakib to Rayudu, SIX, he's back to taking the aggressive route again. Advances, takes it on the full and muscles it over the man at long-off",Shakib to Rayudu,SIX
7242907,CSK 1st Inns,18.0,"S Kaul to Dhoni, SIX, he got away with a couple of full tosses earlier in the over, but Dhoni has had enough. Absolutely tonks it flat over the square leg boundary. Just 8 needed now.",S Kaul to Dhoni,SIX
7242907,CSK 1st Inns,2.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Watson, SIX, Sandeep's slower ball goes awry. It was the knuckle ball and Watson spotted it early. Squated low and helped it over short fine leg. Clears the rope for a maximum",Sandeep Sharma to Watson,SIX
7242907,CSK 1st Inns,3.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Watson, SIX, 'don't bowl short to me' - Watson's body language suggested as Sandeep overbakes and goes short. Watson stays in his crease, allows for the ball to come and pulls it with brute force over mid-wicket",Sandeep Sharma to Watson,SIX
7242907,CSK 1st Inns,3.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu, SIX, Rayudu gets into the act. Reaches out for a fuller length delivery outside off and effortlessly lifts it over extra cover",Bhuvneshwar to Rayudu,SIX
7242907,CSK 1st Inns,6.2,"S Kaul to Rayudu, SIX, in the air and clears Hales at long-on. He seemed to have misjudged it there, runs forward and later realises that the ball is sailing over his head. Short again, Rayudu stayed back and smacked it flat and hard - enough wood to take it all the way",S Kaul to Rayudu,SIX
7242907,SRH 1st Inns,10.5,"Jadeja to Dhawan, SIX, only a hit away from his fifty now. This was a full delivery outside off and Dhawan smoked it over long-on for half a dozen. Great shot by the southpaw",Jadeja to Dhawan,SIX
7242907,SRH 1st Inns,11.2,"Watson to Williamson, SIX, impressive! How well was this timed! Length ball on middle and leg, Williamson pulls it over square leg for a well timed six. Came right from the meat of his willow",Watson to Williamson,SIX
7242907,SRH 1st Inns,12.5,"Jadeja to Dhawan, SIX, what a shot to reach his fifty! Shortish delivery around off, Dhawan doesn't miss out on the opportunity and swings it over mid-wicket. Flat and over the ropes, she goes!",Jadeja to Dhawan,SIX
7242907,SRH 1st Inns,13.1,"Harbhajan to Williamson, SIX, if Dhawan from other end is changing gears, Williamson decides to up the ante as well. Skips out, Harbhajan gives more flight. KW isn't to the pitch, but still goes through by getting his weight forward. Sends it soaring over long-off. All the way!",Harbhajan to Williamson,SIX
7242907,SRH 1st Inns,13.5,"Harbhajan to Dhawan, SIX, bread and butter for Dhawan. It looked as though he was waiting for it. Harbhajan drops a rank long hop, Dhawan sits back and smokes it over cow corner. Into the crowd",Harbhajan to Dhawan,SIX
7242907,SRH 1st Inns,18.4,"SN Thakur to Deepak Hooda, SIX, in the slot and out of the park. Thakur gets his line closer to off, Hooda stays still and biffs it powerfully over long-off",SN Thakur to Deepak Hooda,SIX
9236293,MI 1st Inns,12.0,"Gowtham to Lewis, SIX, full toss. Talk about ruining a quiet over under the radar. Lewis has his muscles blowing them out of here. 88 meters into the stands behind the sightscreen. And it's a fifty",Gowtham to Lewis,SIX
9236293,MI 1st Inns,13.1,"D Kulkarni to Lewis, SIX, welcome back Kulkarni! Off-speed delivery and Lewis picked the bones out of that, spotted it early and powered straight back over the bowler. He then stood and admired that shot",D Kulkarni to Lewis,SIX
9236293,MI 1st Inns,18.1,"Unadkat to Hardik Pandya, SIX, into the second tier. Unadkat is predictable with his change of pace and Pandya was waiting for it, cleared his front leg and smashed it straight back over the sightscreen. Mumbai need plenty more of this",Unadkat to Hardik Pandya,SIX
9236293,MI 1st Inns,18.3,"Unadkat to Hardik Pandya, SIX, Unadkat is dishing out freebies. Another nice juicy full toss outside off, just the right amount of width for Pandya to tonk the loft over extra cover.

9236293,MI 1st Inns,19.1,"Stokes to Cutting, SIX, Cutting making RR pay for the drop catch. Stokes is slower ball is right in the slot, Cutting delayed his shot for a second and hammered it with a clean swing over long-on",Stokes to Cutting,SIX
9236293,MI 1st Inns,8.1,"Shreyas Gopal to Lewis, SIX, the launch. Can't bowl down leg, not a googly either. Knee, slog, sweep, backward square leg. It's flatly powerful enough to damage a billboard",Shreyas Gopal to Lewis,SIX
9236293,MI 1st Inns,8.2,"Shreyas Gopal to Lewis, SIX, on the move, Gopal corrects on middle, but Lewis' gone over extra cover. Throws every cell in his body into this hoick",Shreyas Gopal to Lewis,SIX
9236293,RR 1st Inns,10.0,"Markande to Buttler, SIX, that ones with the crowd now. Big hit over long-on there. Markande bowls it a touch slow, and Buttler makes that last-minute room to chidingly loft it away",Markande to Buttler,SIX
9236293,RR 1st Inns,13.3,"Hardik Pandya to Buttler, SIX, not quite as pretty as those Dhoni's bottom-handed whips over long-on but this is good enough. Carries all the way. Takes on the seam-up length ball and muscles it across the line",Hardik Pandya to Buttler,SIX
9236293,RR 1st Inns,14.4,"Bumrah to Buttler, SIX, and now one better. Swivels this time, and deposits the short ball over long leg this time. Game slipping, or has it already?",Bumrah to Buttler,SIX
9236293,RR 1st Inns,17.2,"Hardik Pandya to Samson, SIX, that's flown off Samson's bat. He walks stone-faced to the middle of the pitch and punches gloves with Buttler. Slow ball sitting up and Samson mowing it over cow corner has to be a sight to behold",Hardik Pandya to Samson,SIX
9236293,RR 1st Inns,17.3,"Hardik Pandya to Samson, SIX, this is a glorious glorious pull. Pandya just stares and walks back to the top of his mark. You do that when you've been pulled off the front foot, and the ball flies over deep mid-wicket",Hardik Pandya to Samson,SIX
9236293,RR 1st Inns,18.0,"Hardik Pandya to Buttler, SIX, Mumbai Buttler'ed at home. Slow ball sitting up and martyed over cow corner",Hardik Pandya to Buttler,SIX
9236293,RR 1st Inns,4.4,"Krunal Pandya to Buttler, SIX, just over Hardik. The slog sweep and Buttler almost found the only man in the deep on the leg-side, shuffled across and mistimed the sweep towards deep mid-wicket. Hardik jumped but the ball was well over him",Krunal Pandya to Buttler,SIX
4623967,KXIP 1st Inns,11.1,"Moeen Ali to Finch, SIX, welcome to the attack Moeen Ali! Dragged back length and Finch makes room to thump the pull over deep mid-wicket. That is a monster hit from the Aussie and he remains the key for KXIP",Moeen Ali to Finch,SIX
4623967,KXIP 1st Inns,2.0,"Southee to Rahul, SIX, hello says the batsman as he was greeted with a short ball. The batsman did not waste time to transfer his weight on the back foot and hammers it over deep backward square leg off the front foot. Terrific hit",Southee to Rahul,SIX
4623967,KXIP 1st Inns,2.5,"U Yadav to Rahul, SIX, short ball, journey ball and goes the distance. The batsman this time stayed firm on the back foot and hammered the pull over deep fine leg for a sixer. Into the second tier",U Yadav to Rahul,SIX
4623967,KXIP 1st Inns,4.2,"U Yadav to Rahul, SIX, picks the slower short ball like dead meat and picks the bones out of it by smacking it over deep mid-wicket. He waited on it and then smashed it out of his sight. Third six of the evening for Rahul",U Yadav to Rahul,SIX
4623967,KXIP 1st Inns,8.0,"Siraj to Finch, SIX, this is exactly what RCB don't want. That was full and that disappeared. Booming hit over covers for a sixer. Flat and powerful. This landed in the range of the batsman and Finch drop kicked the ball away. Is there Finch magic on the cards?",Siraj to Finch,SIX
4623967,RCB 1st Inns,2.1,"Rajpoot to Kohli, SIX, look at the swagger on this shot! With due respect to Rajpoot, the man facing him is just too good. Full and in the slot, it's in the arc for Kohli who nonchalantly clubs this into the stands at cow corner. Cold welcome for the young man",Rajpoot to Kohli,SIX
4623967,RCB 1st Inns,6.0,"Andrew Tye to Kohli, SIX, that's dumped over long-off. RCB cantering away to victory. Just a few blows away if they go at this rate.

5237835,KKR 1st Inns,0.3,"Gowtham to Narine, SIX, now puts on the wheels. Comes down the track and mauls it over long-on. Gowtham clasps his hands but that's not in appreciation, as you'd have guessed",Gowtham to Narine,SIX

5237835,KKR 1st Inns,2.4,"Jofra Archer to Chris Lynn, SIX, a 145ks delivery no good for all-hands Lynn. Moves a little leg-side and scythes this short incoming delivery over backward square leg. Didn't even rock back fully. Didn't need to",Jofra Archer to Chris Lynn,SIX
5237835,KKR 1st Inns,7.4,"Gowtham to Nitish Rana, SIX, Gowtham's horror isn't over. Brilliant loft from Nitish Rana, stepping out and timing it over extra cover. Flew into the crowd",Gowtham to Nitish Rana,SIX
5237835,RR 1st Inns,1.3,"Prasidh to R Tripathi, SIX, full and not too wide, on off-stump in fact, Tripathi makes his own width by making room outside off and slices that over the sweeper cover fence for six! Massive hit!",Prasidh to R Tripathi,SIX
5237835,RR 1st Inns,14.3,"Shivam Mavi to Unadkat, SIX, short ball and six! That was a splendid hit. More of a reactive shot as he looked like he was slightly late on it but that travelled the entire journey. Over the deep square region and Mavi takes some more punishment",Shivam Mavi to Unadkat,SIX
5237835,RR 1st Inns,2.2,"Shivam Mavi to Buttler, SIX, fuller length delivery just outside off, Buttler preempts the periscope and laps it over the tiny fine leg boundary for six!",Shivam Mavi to Buttler,SIX

3429315,KXIP 1st Inns,16.0,"Markande to Rahul, SIX, and again. Much cleaner, much bigger. The Kings XI dugout is on its feet as Rahul finishes the over off with back-to-back sixes. Puts his dancing shoes on again and swings through the line of the delivery",Markande to Rahul,SIX

3429315,MI 1st Inns,1.5,"Mohit Sharma to Lewis, SIX, the first six of the evening - on a good length and just outside off, Lewis got forward on the lofted drive, didn't time it all that well - ended up slicing it high and over mid-off - has enough to clear the ropes on the full",Mohit Sharma to Lewis,SIX
3429315,MI 1st Inns,11.2,"Stoinis to Krunal Pandya, SIX, just over the outstreched hand of Ankit Rajpoot at long leg. Just! Krunal went for the pull, didn't get all of it, dragged it off the bottom half and it eluded the fieldsman near the boundary ropes. Rajpoot kept his head still and flung himself backwards, but it fell tantalizingly past his fingertips",Stoinis to Krunal Pandya,SIX
3429315,MI 1st Inns,11.3,"Stoinis to Krunal Pandya, SIX, nothing half-hearted about this. Picked the length (short) early and deposited this over wide long-on with an air of nonchalance. Typical Krunal",Stoinis to Krunal Pandya,SIX
3429315,MI 1st Inns,13.0,"Axar to Pollard, SIX, becoming too predictable is Axar Patel. The last four balls have been over 100ks. This one's no different either; KP did the smart thing, gave himself room outside off by jumping to the leg-side and tonked this into the cow corner stands with a mighty swing of the bat",Axar to Pollard,SIX
3429315,MI 1st Inns,13.2,"Rajpoot to Pollard, SIX, KP is upping the ante now. A risky shot, but he generated enough power to clear the ropes. A 76-metre six. Short ball wide of KP's off-stump, he fetches from there and hacks the pull over long-on. Manoj Tiwary was interested for a bit, but that was always travelling",Rajpoot to Pollard,SIX
3429315,MI 1st Inns,15.0,"Stoinis to Pollard, SIX, a 22-ball fifty for KP. He pumps his fists and lets out all the excitement. It was full and right in his swinging arc, KP gets underneath that and launches it many-a-mile over long-off",Stoinis to Pollard,SIX

3429315,MI 1st Inns,2.5,"Rajpoot to Suryakumar Yadav, SIX, lovely shot, back-to-back sixes for Suryakumar and he was in complete control here.

3429315,MI 1st Inns,4.4,"Mohit Sharma to Ishan Kishan, SIX, massive, too short and the angle worked against Mohit here, Kishan swivels across, doesn't bother to keep the ball down and sends it soaring into the second tier - way over backward square leg for a maximum",Mohit Sharma to Ishan Kishan,SIX

2266358,RCB 1st Inns,11.5,"S Kaul to Moeen Ali, SIX, Moeen Ali is taking all his frustration at not being selected for the Test side against the SRH bowlers.

That was meaty",S Kaul to Moeen Ali,SIX
2266358,RCB 1st Inns,12.4,"Basil Thampi to de Villiers, SIX, that has gone out of the Chinnaswamy! And might have landed on something or someone outside the ground. What's AB's reaction - stoic! Again his trademark shot, sit down, move across, a juicy full-toss and it has been sent over the deep backward square leg roof. A souvenir for someone to take home. Chants of ""AB"" echo around the ground as the players wait for a fresh cherry. Meanwhile AB and Moeen Ali have some refreshments",Basil Thampi to de Villiers,SIX
2266358,RCB 1st Inns,13.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Moeen Ali, SIX, it has gone for six. A checked loft. Are you serious? Dhawan can only smile wryly, as it loops over his head.

2266358,RCB 1st Inns,17.2,"S Kaul to de Grandhomme, SIX, high high and over the backtracking Rashid at deep mid. That was a misjudgement from the Afghan.

One more biggie to de Grandhomme",S Kaul to de Grandhomme,SIX
2266358,RCB 1st Inns,18.1,"Basil Thampi to de Grandhomme, SIX, that is brute power from CdG. Brutal from the Zimbawean-turned-Kiwi. Waited for the slower delivery and then slapped it high and powerfully over extra-cover. Kohli smiles and claps",Basil Thampi to de Grandhomme,SIX
2266358,RCB 1st Inns,18.4,"Basil Thampi to Sarfaraz Khan, SIX, last match they had a fielder just behind the keeper, very fine and he was caught. Not this time.

4205133,CSK 1st Inns,5.5,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, SIX, it's gone all the way! Rayudu is taking a liking to Avesh. Charges down the track and knows that the length will be shortened. Adjusts to pull it over deep mid-wicket. Easily over the ropes",Avesh Khan to Rayudu,SIX
4205133,CSK 1st Inns,6.0,"Avesh Khan to Rayudu, SIX, third maximum of the over! Rayudu has gone bonkers. Walks down the track and makes room as well, Avesh continues to err on the shorter side and this disappears as well. Way into the crowd at cow corner",Avesh Khan to Rayudu,SIX
4205133,CSK 1st Inns,8.5,"Mishra to Rayudu, SIX, straight down the ground! The pressure builds, Mishra bowls a full-toss on middle and off, Rayudu nimble down the track and clubs that straight down the ground into the sightscreen",Mishra to Rayudu,SIX
4205133,DC 1st Inns,16.5,"SN Thakur to Vijay Shankar, SIX, that's deep into the crowd! Plenty of power from Vijay Shankar on this stroke. He's smoked it away. Short of a length and he is now expecting this length. Sits deep in the crease to clobber the pull away by standing tall. Meaty blow",SN Thakur to Vijay Shankar,SIX
4205133,DC 1st Inns,17.1,"Dwayne Bravo to Harshal Patel, SIX, for a moment Rayudu at fine leg thought he had a chance as he raced to his left but this cleared the square leg fence. Fuller ball on middle and off, Patel just went across to play the pick up shot. Quick hands and supple wrists on the drop kick from Patel as this whistled away",Dwayne Bravo to Harshal Patel,SIX
4205133,DC 1st Inns,19.1,"Dwayne Bravo to Harshal Patel, SIX, hugeeeeeeeeee! Bravo decides not to bowl the slower ball and it disappears. Fullish and in the slot, lots of pace and it's in the arc as well. Patel does the needful by bludgeoning it way over long-on. Handy blows, these, for DD",Dwayne Bravo to Harshal Patel,SIX
4205133,DC 1st Inns,19.3,"Dwayne Bravo to Vijay Shankar, SIX, there goes another! Bravo's death bowling issues this season continue. Is being taken to the cleaners tonight as well. Slower but it's on the shorter side, Shankar gets hold of it and pulls it away over deep backward square leg",Dwayne Bravo to Vijay Shankar,SIX
4205133,DC 1st Inns,19.5,"Dwayne Bravo to Harshal Patel, SIX, this is fantastic hitting from Harshal Patel. He is being aided by some poor bowling too. Half-volley and it's a pacy ball, Patel drills it dead straight down the ground. Into the sightscreen for another maximum",Dwayne Bravo to Harshal Patel,SIX
4205133,DC 1st Inns,2.3,"Chahar to Prithvi Shaw, SIX, Chahar errs and Shaw pounces. Shortens the length and angles one on middle and leg, Shaw gets into a good position with a slight shuffle and shoves it over mid-wicket. Goes all the way",Chahar to Prithvi Shaw,SIX
4205133,DC 1st Inns,20.0,"Dwayne Bravo to Harshal Patel, SIX, 26 off the final over! Just the momentum push DD were seeking and they've finished with a flourish here. Bravo loses the plot completely to dish out a juicy full toss, Harshal in this hitting mood isn't going to miss out. Goes straight once again with the loft and once more, crashes into the sightscreen for a maximum",Dwayne Bravo to Harshal Patel,SIX
4205133,DC 1st Inns,9.1,"Harbhajan to Pant, SIX, that's one helluva shot! From round the wicket, Harbhajan doles out a leg-stump half-volley, Pant goes slightly leg-side and clouts it over deep mid-wicket. Way into the stands. Absolutely pummeled",Harbhajan to Pant,SIX
4205133,DC 1st Inns,9.5,"Harbhajan to Pant, SIX, how did that go for a six? Did Ngidi misjudge that? He ran forward from long-off and then had to come back again. Jumps up in the end, but in vain. Coming to the shot, Pant wasn't targeting that region. He got down to slog over cow corner. The ball ballooned up off the top-edge and just cleared the ropes",Harbhajan to Pant,SIX
9498235,RCB 1st Inns,1.1,"Jofra Archer to Parthiv Patel, SIX, how good is that? Pacy short delivery and at the body, what does Parthiv Patel do? He just ramps it for six. Using the bat as a help, periscope style. I guess it is Baz who caught that? in the RCB dugout. No my colleague - Nikhil tells me Baz has dropped it and he is right",Jofra Archer to Parthiv Patel,SIX
9498235,RCB 1st Inns,2.0,"Jofra Archer to Parthiv Patel, SIX, six again. An action replay of the first six. Just that Baz didn't drop it in the dugout. Using the pace of Jofra Archer to a nicety. Expensive over from the Bajan",Jofra Archer to Parthiv Patel,SIX
9498235,RR 1st Inns,12.0,"de Grandhomme to R Tripathi, SIX, now he'll try to shift gears. Walks down the track and chips the length ball right over the bowler's head. Such sweet timing on this blow. For a moment I thought this was only a boundary, but no. It's a maximum!",de Grandhomme to R Tripathi,SIX
9498235,RR 1st Inns,14.5,"Moeen Ali to R Tripathi, SIX, that's a massive blow. Nicely done. Was a tossed up delivery outside off, the batsman came down the wicket and went ahead with his loft, right over the bowler's head and over the ropes. The fielder at long-on was a mere spectator",Moeen Ali to R Tripathi,SIX
9498235,RR 1st Inns,18.2,"Siraj to Klaasen, SIX, this is the class of Klaasen. This is what he can do. This was a full length delivery outside off, Klaasen frees his arms and carves it over third man. Beautiful shot!",Siraj to Klaasen,SIX
9498235,RR 1st Inns,19.2,"Southee to Gowtham, SIX, how often has he done that? Makes six hitting so simple, does Gowtham. Wonder why he wasn't sent to open the innings. This was a short delivery and the all-rounder simply pulled it over mid-wicket",Southee to Gowtham,SIX
9498235,RR 1st Inns,19.3,"Southee to Gowtham, SIX, excellent shot! Full in length around off, Gowtham stands tall and pumps it over long-off. Back-to-back sixes for Gowtham and the crowd is lovin' it",Southee to Gowtham,SIX
9498235,RR 1st Inns,2.4,"Moeen Ali to R Tripathi, SIX, first maximum! Premeditated, but he made excellent contact. Flat ball wide of off, Tripathi gets down on a knee after moving towards off. Follows with a massive slog sweep over deep backward square leg",Moeen Ali to R Tripathi,SIX
9377212,KKR 1st Inns,10.5,"Sandeep Sharma to Chris Lynn, SIX, that's just a blatant display of biceps. Comes on the front foot and scythes this length ball over cow corner. Trust me when I say this: it was hammered away disdainfully with a torso torque",Sandeep Sharma to Chris Lynn,SIX
9377212,KKR 1st Inns,11.3,"Shakib to Uthappa, SIX, he's like a scoop of butter today. Reads the length so early that he has the time to get under a Shakib darter. Lifts it over long-on",Shakib to Uthappa,SIX
9377212,KKR 1st Inns,14.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Karthik, SIX, top-edges are the new first aid in cricket. Didn't KKR need that. A back of a length delivery going down leg-side, DK was late on the slog-sweep and ushered a top-edge over fine leg. It was way into the crowd, trust me",Bhuvneshwar to Karthik,SIX
9377212,KKR 1st Inns,15.5,"Rashid Khan to Uthappa, SIX, only fair that Rashid takes the brunt. It's outside off but it's enough for Uthappa. Enough full, enough close. Slogged over deep mid-wicket",Rashid Khan to Uthappa,SIX
9377212,KKR 1st Inns,2.0,"Sandeep Sharma to Narine, SIX, 20 off the over. KKR are making the most of the powerplay. Once again, it's in Narine's swinging territory, he clears his front leg and lifts the ball back over the bowler's head for a stunning maximum",Sandeep Sharma to Narine,SIX
9377212,KKR 1st Inns,2.2,"S Kaul to Chris Lynn, SIX, ah! That shoulder seems to functioning just fine. It was short and drifting into leg stump channels, Lynn clears the front leg and smokes it for a 69-metre maximum over mid-wicket",S Kaul to Chris Lynn,SIX
9377212,KKR 1st Inns,3.3,"Shakib to Narine, SIX, long-on jumped back in desperation, but he never looked like catching that. Clean swing of the willow from Narine, thumps it from middle-stump channel and deposits it way over the fence",Shakib to Narine,SIX
9377212,KKR 1st Inns,7.2,"Brathwaite to Chris Lynn, SIX, length ball in the channel, Lynn feasts on it with a mighty hoick over cow corner. 87-metres to be precise",Brathwaite to Chris Lynn,SIX
9377212,SRH 1st Inns,10.4,"Kuldeep Yadav to Williamson, SIX, ""That is what form does to you,"" says Harsha Bhogle on air. Kuldeep gives plenty of air, but it lands as a freebie for Williamson. On the pads and he comfortably dispatches it over cow corner",Kuldeep Yadav to Williamson,SIX
9377212,SRH 1st Inns,12.2,"Searles to Williamson, SIX, this will hurt KKR. Williamson can play this shot in his sleep. Lenght ball down leg, Williamson gets inside the line and hacks it behind square for a maximum. Easy pickings",Searles to Williamson,SIX
9377212,SRH 1st Inns,12.3,"Searles to Williamson, SIX, make that two sixes in two balls for Williamson. This was the shot he attempted against RCB in the previous game and picked out the fine leg fielder. This time he knew the fielder was inside the ring. Moved across his sticks early, stayed low and helped it supremely over the fielder's head for half-a-dozen",Searles to Williamson,SIX
9377212,SRH 1st Inns,17.4,"Prasidh to Manish Pandey, SIX, cow corner is Pandey's favourite spot and he dismisses one for a maximum. Krishna misses his yorker, Pandey cleared his front leg and banged it flat, enough timing on it to take it all the way",Prasidh to Manish Pandey,SIX
9377212,SRH 1st Inns,2.3,"A Russell to Goswami, SIX, that's adding insult to injury for Russell, on a good length and just outside off, Goswami backs away slightly, plays with an open face and slices it high and over cover, went a long way over the stands",A Russell to Goswami,SIX
9377212,SRH 1st Inns,5.3,"Narine to Dhawan, SIX, lovely, tad too full from Narine, Dhawan gets a good stride forward, drives it through the line and clears the ropes at long-on with ease. The key was he didn't look to muscle the shot, nor did he play across the line",Narine to Dhawan,SIX
8897809,DC 1st Inns,12.1,"Cutting to Vijay Shankar, SIX, massive, that should break the shackles for DD, too full and in the slot, Vijay Shankar extends his arms and lifts it high and over long-on, Rohit was a mere spectator as the ball sailed over his head",Cutting to Vijay Shankar,SIX
8897809,DC 1st Inns,14.2,"Mustafizur to Pant, SIX, a one-handed six now, how do you bowl to this man? On a good length and well outside off, Pant was looking to swipe it towards the on-side, his bottom hand came off at the point of impact, but it still had enough power to sail into the crowd at wide long-on",Mustafizur to Pant,SIX
8897809,DC 1st Inns,15.1,"Hardik Pandya to Pant, SIX, cheeky and six, how good is this shot? Length delivery on the stumps, Pant was quick to reverse his stance, plays with an open face and ramps it over short third man, Hardik's pace is enough for the ball to sail over the ropes",Hardik Pandya to Pant,SIX
8897809,DC 1st Inns,15.4,"Hardik Pandya to Pant, SIX, another one-handed six, Hardik is getting a serious pasting here.

8897809,DC 1st Inns,17.4,"Mustafizur to Abhishek Sharma, SIX, lovely, length ball from Mustafizur and it sat up to be smacked, Abhishek waits on it and then pummels it sweetly - high and way over mid-wicket for a massive six",Mustafizur to Abhishek Sharma,SIX

8897809,DC 1st Inns,7.0,"Markande to Pant, SIX, full delivery angling towards leg, the googly, but Pant comes down the track and gets to the pitch so fast that he doesn't let it turn. Gets that bat of his down from a high backlift and slogs it into the deep mid-wicket crowd for six",Markande to Pant,SIX
8897809,MI 1st Inns,0.2,"Lamichhane to Suryakumar Yadav, SIX, the intentions are clear from Suryakumar. Wasting no time whatsoever in putting these filths to the fence. Another dragged down delivery, on leg. Suryakumar bends low to get in line with the ball and hacks it behind square for a maximum. 10 off first two, pressure on the bowler",Lamichhane to Suryakumar Yadav,SIX
8897809,MI 1st Inns,11.1,"Lamichhane to Hardik Pandya, SIX, but that is not the way Hardik thinks.. Anything with flight and in his arc, Hardik will go for it, through the line and with a clean bat swing sends it soaring over the long-on fence, into the second tier",Lamichhane to Hardik Pandya,SIX
8897809,MI 1st Inns,16.5,"Boult to Cutting, SIX, that's more like it. Right in the slot and it is a 83 meter six from Cutting. Just a bit of shuffle to off and got nicely underneath the length ball, the big forearms then took over to smash it over long-on",Boult to Cutting,SIX
8897809,MI 1st Inns,17.2,"Plunkett to Cutting, SIX, wow! That's gone a long way. This match ain't over. Mumbai's season ain't over. Until Cutting is there. Plunkett is bowling length and Cutting is waiting for it, muscles the loft well over the long-on fence",Plunkett to Cutting,SIX
8897809,MI 1st Inns,19.1,"Harshal Patel to Cutting, SIX, oh my! Cutting has got the best possible start to the over. Patel does not have the pace to bowl short and it sits up nicely for Cutting, who swivels across and sends the pull soaring over the long leg fence",Harshal Patel to Cutting,SIX
8897809,MI 1st Inns,3.5,"Harshal Patel to Lewis, SIX, Lewis is wading into Patel now. Overbakes and bangs it short, Lewis can deal with short balls with ease. Sits back and muscles it way back into the deep mid-wicket stands. Into the second tier",Harshal Patel to Lewis,SIX
8897809,MI 1st Inns,4.2,"Maxwell to Lewis, SIX, in the slot and Lewis makes Maxwell pay the penalty. Flighted full outside off, Lewis chips out of his crease, flexes his muscles and smokes it over long-off. Stand and dismiss stuff",Maxwell to Lewis,SIX
8897809,MI 1st Inns,5.0,"Maxwell to Lewis, SIX, a six off the final ball and 16 runs to cap off the over. Lewis is getting a move on here. Motions out of his crease to meet the pitch and allows his bottom hand to take over. Blasted disdainfully over long-off",Maxwell to Lewis,SIX
8897809,MI 1st Inns,8.5,"Mishra to Lewis, SIX, Lewis gets underneath this flighted delivery and sweeps it straight into the ad-cushions behind square on the leg-side. Mishra looped it on leg-stump and Lewis went low in time to connect it beautifully to smash it for a maximum",Mishra to Lewis,SIX
9283980,CSK 1st Inns,14.1,"Ashwin to Chahar, SIX, he has whacked this carrom ball over deep square leg's head. Not long boundaries here, so even a decent contact comfortably takes it over the ropes. Walked across the stumps, sat down low and got a great length for the slog-sweep",Ashwin to Chahar,SIX
9283980,CSK 1st Inns,14.2,"Ashwin to Chahar, SIX, now a blistering strike over long-off. Wow. Ashwin had fired this pretty wide of off, so Chahar had to reach out slightly, but the timing is still so sublime",Ashwin to Chahar,SIX
9283980,CSK 1st Inns,15.2,"Axar to Chahar, SIX, my word does he have some ability with the bat! This is a stunning shot. Makes some room to a length ball and flat-bats it over long-off. Wow Deepak Chahar",Axar to Chahar,SIX
9283980,CSK 1st Inns,18.1,"Andrew Tye to Raina, SIX, finally gets hold of one! He waited just a moment longer to account for the knuckle ball, and then heaved it away for a flat six. Even this had come more off the bottom of his bat actually, but again, these are short boundaries",Andrew Tye to Raina,SIX
9283980,CSK 1st Inns,18.3,"Andrew Tye to Raina, SIX, pops Tye over long-on to raise his fifty! The equation has come down to a run-a-ball. Don't think he got this one off the middle either, but got enough to just clear the leaping fielder",Andrew Tye to Raina,SIX
9283980,CSK 1st Inns,19.1,"Mohit Sharma to Dhoni, SIX, finishes it off by pulling this short ball over the long leg boundary, and then calmly tips the bails over. And that's how the IPL 2018 league stages end, with SRH, CSK, KKR and RR going through",Mohit Sharma to Dhoni,SIX
9283980,CSK 1st Inns,6.4,"Rajpoot to Harbhajan, SIX, finally gets some bat on it! Was trying to do this since ages. Clears his front leg and pumps the length delivery over long-off for a flat six",Rajpoot to Harbhajan,SIX
9283980,KXIP 1st Inns,13.2,"Jadeja to Nair, SIX, just clears the man in the deep. Flatter around middle and leg, Nair goes down on his knee and slog sweeps it over square leg. Ngidi is the man in the deep who tries hard to grab it in left hand but it's way above him",Jadeja to Nair,SIX
9283980,KXIP 1st Inns,14.1,"Dwayne Bravo to Nair, SIX, excellent lofted shot. Full in length around off, Nair moves away, makes room for himself and times his loft over long-off. Right from the meat and comfortably over the ropes",Dwayne Bravo to Nair,SIX
9283980,KXIP 1st Inns,15.4,"Jadeja to Axar, SIX, lovely shot! Picks the length early on the short one, backs away and nonchalantly lofts it over long-off. Has enough on it to evade the man in the deep",Jadeja to Axar,SIX
9283980,KXIP 1st Inns,16.5,"SN Thakur to Nair, SIX, shot! This is what KXIP exactly want. Short again on middle and leg, Nair stays in his crease and swings it over square leg. Way into the stands, such sweet was the timing",SN Thakur to Nair,SIX

9283980,KXIP 1st Inns,18.4,"Dwayne Bravo to Nair, SIX, fifty for Karun Nair! Preity Zinta in the stands loves it. Was a short delivery around off, Nair comes down the wicket and slaps the slower one over long-on",Dwayne Bravo to Nair,SIX
9283980,KXIP 1st Inns,7.0,"Chahar to Miller, SIX, for a moment, I thought that he had mishit that. How wrong was I? Pitched up delivery outside off, Miller reaches out, bends the back knee and lofts it over long-off. High and handsome. A six off the free-hit",Chahar to Miller,SIX
9283980,KXIP 1st Inns,7.3,"Harbhajan to Manoj Tiwary, SIX, Jadeja can only get a hand on it and he parries it over the ropes. Would be very harsh to call it a drop. Tiwary danced down the track and slug in the direction of the turn. Just over RJ at long-on, who timed his jump to perfection and went for a one-handed catch",Harbhajan to Manoj Tiwary,SIX
8593147,CSK 1st Inns,14.0,"Shakib to du Plessis, SIX, straight down the ground from Faf, clean strike. He's got to pick his bowlers now, and he's got 10 off two balls from Shakib. Swings through the line of the full ball and sends it soaring over long-on",Shakib to du Plessis,SIX
8593147,CSK 1st Inns,14.1,"Sandeep Sharma to Chahar, SIX, and Chahar goes bang. Well, not quite a BANG, but bang enough. Off-pace back of length delivery, he swipes cross-batted and clears the mid-wicket boundary. It came off the toe-end, but these are short boundary",Sandeep Sharma to Chahar,SIX
8593147,CSK 1st Inns,17.3,"Brathwaite to du Plessis, SIX, oh what a shot. He's picked the bones out of it. An 87-metre six pumps up the CSK dugout while raising the fifty for the South African player. Brathwaite offers it in the slot again, and gets smoked away",Brathwaite to du Plessis,SIX
8593147,CSK 1st Inns,19.1,"Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, SIX, Faf du Plessis, you champion! He takes just one ball to do it. Slower ball on a length, whacks it back down the ground to smash those LED boards before raising his arms and letting out a huge roar",Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis,SIX
8593147,CSK 1st Inns,8.4,"Brathwaite to du Plessis, SIX, risky but much needed for du Plessis, banged in short and just outside off, du Plessis was on the back-foot, didn't get hold of the cross-batted slap, just about has enough to clear the man at long leg",Brathwaite to du Plessis,SIX
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,17.1,"SN Thakur to Brathwaite, SIX, first six of the innings, taken SRH 17 overs to smack one out of the park. Brathwaite gets the perfect length delivery, right in his arc to swing it over the deep mid-wicket fence. Went a long way back",SN Thakur to Brathwaite,SIX
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,17.2,"SN Thakur to Brathwaite, SIX, back to back sixes. Thakur overcorrects by dragging the length back, but Brathwaite was up for it. In fact, he might have been waiting for it, stands tall and murders the pull over deep mid-wicket",SN Thakur to Brathwaite,SIX
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,19.3,"SN Thakur to Brathwaite, SIX, small margins for errors.

9461343,KKR 1st Inns,13.4,"Shreyas Gopal to Shubman Gill, SIX, Gill is getting a move on. Knew what was coming from Gopal, it was the juicy leg-break.

9461343,KKR 1st Inns,14.0,"Shreyas Gopal to Karthik, SIX, this maximum brings the 50-stand up for the duo. Another drag down delivery from Gopal, comes off the final ball of his spell. Karthik sees it early, pivots back and smacks it over cow corner. Feel for Gopal, he's bowled so well, just that lost his line and lengths in his last over",Shreyas Gopal to Karthik,SIX
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,14.5,"Jofra Archer to A Russell, SIX, wades into Archer. Just cannot bowl there for Russell. Goes full and at the stumps, Russell takes his front leg out of the way and dismisses it over long-on. Sheer disdain",Jofra Archer to A Russell,SIX
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,16.1,"Unadkat to Karthik, SIX, top-edge but it's that sort of an edge that batsman loves. Unorthodoxy by Karthik, moves across to hoick it across the line with a horizontal bat. A fat top-edge is found and it's going only one way. Over the keeper's head and off she goes for half-a-dozen. Fifty up for the skipper, much vital this for the team. Raises his bat and the dug-out in all applauses",Unadkat to Karthik,SIX
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,16.3,"Unadkat to A Russell, SIX, Unadkat's nightmarish day continues. Cutter to Russell? Too full and Russell feasts on it. Sets up a low stance and hacks it violently through mid-wicket. Flat and the deep mid-wicket fielder was lining up, but it cleared Samson in the end. Hits his fingertips and parries over. Brutal",Unadkat to A Russell,SIX
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,17.2,"Laughlin to A Russell, SIX, incredible! How do you bowl to this guy? Laughlin digs in the slower short ball, Russell stayed back but had to generate some power to clear the deep mid-wicket fielder.

9461343,KKR 1st Inns,18.0,"Laughlin to A Russell, SIX, woah. Change up from Laughlin, ushers in the pacy bouncer at Russell's torso. Took the gamble but didn't come off well. Russell pulls it over his head and dismisses it over fine leg. All the way!",Laughlin to A Russell,SIX
9461343,KKR 1st Inns,18.5,"Jofra Archer to A Russell, SIX, phew! That bat-speed and the muscle power from Russell. Didn't get it off the middle but it hardly matters to him. The back of the hand slower ball, rising up and Russell forehand swats it over long-off. Sends it a long way over long-off. Came off the bottom, still dispatched it for a maximum. How?",Jofra Archer to A Russell,SIX
9461343,RR 1st Inns,0.4,"A Russell to Rahane, SIX, ah Jinks. Gets a wide-short combo, Rahane rocks back, sways, but the hands are quick to pounce on. Cuts, airy and that Centurion-2003 moment as it flies into deep point",A Russell to Rahane,SIX
9461343,RR 1st Inns,13.5,"Narine to Samson, SIX, that is a jail-break from Samson! Retaliation from the batter as he camped back to smoke a sixer over deep mid. That was gargantuan from the young man and 61 is needed now. RR, more importantly Samson, needed that",Narine to Samson,SIX
9461343,RR 1st Inns,4.3,"Narine to R Tripathi, SIX, there's long-on. But why bother when you can time it like this. Narine tosses his carrom ball full, Tripathi's down on a knee already. And smoking it .. 20 rows back",Narine to R Tripathi,SIX
9461343,RR 1st Inns,4.4,"Narine to R Tripathi, SIX, it can get longer. Tripathi makes his 'V' bigger, clears his leg, sits as usual. And it's for cow corner's crowds to try and grab that lakh",Narine to R Tripathi,SIX
9461343,RR 1st Inns,9.2,"Searles to Samson, SIX, 122.9kph of a filthy nothing. Samson stays up tall, swinging horizontally. Picks up the empty mid-wicket and a 68-meter hit will do",Searles to Samson,SIX

2245633,KKR 1st Inns,2.0,"Chakravarthy to Narine, SIX, 25 off the over! Not the start the debutant would have hoped for. The pressure got to him and he darted a full ball on the pads. Easy pickings for Narine, who flicked it over backward square leg",Chakravarthy to Narine,SIX
2245633,KKR 1st Inns,4.0,"Viljoen to Uthappa, SIX, shot! Viljoen provided a bit of width outside off on this short of length delivery and Uthappa used his quick hands to great effect. Carved it over backward point and the ball has enough wings to go the distance",Viljoen to Uthappa,SIX

7172727,RR 1st Inns,7.3,"Rahul Chahar to Buttler, SIX, Chahar errs by landing one in Buttler's arc, it was the googly which was right in the slot, Buttler goes with the spin and smashes the loft over the long-on fence",Rahul Chahar to Buttler,SIX
7172727,RR 1st Inns,8.1,"Krunal Pandya to Buttler, SIX, Buttler has taken over the baton after Rahane's dismissal. Runs down the wicket, gets close to the delivery and then uses his power to muscle the ball over the cow corner fence",Krunal Pandya to Buttler,SIX
7172727,RR 1st Inns,8.4,"Krunal Pandya to Buttler, SIX, he just stands there and admires the shot. Darted into the slot, Buttler with a cleared front leg helps himself to another maximum, smacks with minimum backlift over long-on",Krunal Pandya to Buttler,SIX
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,12.5,"Siraj to Sarfaraz Khan, SIX, it is not Gayle but Sarfaraz who will have a piece of Siraj. The cheeky right hander, goes down to play that over-the-head-scoop, makes decent connect and the ball sails into the stands",Siraj to Sarfaraz Khan,SIX
4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,16.3,"Siraj to Gayle, SIX, he's sent this to the moon! Oh, my! What a hit! Short of a length, sits up nicely for Gayle who clears his front leg and goes booooom! Soaring into the skies at the deep mid-wicket region",Siraj to Gayle,SIX

4765480,KXIP 1st Inns,8.4,"Chahal to Agarwal, SIX, fabulous shot! Chahal gets wicket with this delivery but not that of Agarwal. Floated it outside off and tempted the batsman, Agarwal keeps a low base, gets low and underneath that to loft it handsomely over extra cover. Goes all the way",Chahal to Agarwal,SIX
4765480,RCB 1st Inns,17.4,"Tye to de Villiers, SIX, short of length delivery wide of off, punished by de Villiers who slaps it over extra cover. Turning out to be a great over for RCB",Tye to de Villiers,SIX

3993413,CSK 1st Inns,10.2,"Kuldeep Yadav to Kedar Jadhav, SIX, oh, he's miscued this but guess what? It's sailed all the way for a maximum.

3993413,CSK 1st Inns,12.3,"Kuldeep Yadav to Dhoni, SIX, and now he middles it.. into the crowd. Advances down, it's a googly again and this time Dhoni picks the bones out of it. Crucially, he went with a straight bat and not across the line. Deposits it over long-on",Kuldeep Yadav to Dhoni,SIX
3993413,CSK 1st Inns,13.3,"Chawla to Raina, SIX, steps out close to the pitch and launches it down the ground. May have come close to the bottom of his bat, but there's still enough for a 74-metre six",Chawla to Raina,SIX

3993413,KKR 1st Inns,6.4,"Santner to Chris Lynn, SIX, going, going and gone! One of the cleanest strikes of the afternoon. Lynn puts on his dancing shoes and lofts it over long-on for a towering six. Could have been a maximum on any ground, anywhere in the world",Santner to Chris Lynn,SIX
5013362,DC 1st Inns,19.2,"Bhuvneshwar to K Paul, SIX, Paul has picked the bones out of this! A slower length delivery around off, Keemo lines up for it and swings it over the cow corner for a gigantic six",Bhuvneshwar to K Paul,SIX

5013362,SRH 1st Inns,8.1,"Axar to Warner, SIX, bashes this into the crowd. The way he took stance, it was clear he fancied a bite of Axar. Sensing this, Axar blinked. He dropped it short and was muscled over midwicket",Axar to Warner,SIX
8556956,MI 1st Inns,1.1,"Navdeep Saini to Rohit, SIX, did he hit it that well? Got hold of the short ball and just rolled his wrists over that. The ball seemed to have flown away over fine leg for a sixer. Might have been a bit of a top-edge",Navdeep Saini to Rohit,SIX
8556956,MI 1st Inns,10.2,"Chahal to Ishan Kishan, SIX, that's another monstrous hit from Ishan Kishan! Shimmies out of his crease and smokes this well flighted delivery into the cow corner orbit with a dash of swagger",Chahal to Ishan Kishan,SIX

8556956,MI 1st Inns,3.2,"Siraj to Rohit, SIX, this is silly from Siraj. You can't be bowling short and wide to Rohit. Rohit stays back and square cuts the ball over deep point fence for a sixer. Easy peasy!",Siraj to Rohit,SIX
8556956,MI 1st Inns,5.4,"Navdeep Saini to de Kock, SIX, 143ks dug in short at the batsman, de Kock picks the length slightly late but he has such wonderful hands and he clouts it for a 77-metre maximum over mid-wicket",Navdeep Saini to de Kock,SIX

8556956,RCB 1st Inns,12.3,"Malinga to de Villiers, SIX, shouts of ""ABD, ABD"" were ringing across Wankhede and de Villiers treats them by dismissing this into the deep mid-wicket stands. What a strike! Gee. Picked the short delivery early, it sat up well for him too. Easy-peasy as he nails it off the meat and smokes it over the fence",Malinga to de Villiers,SIX
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,13.4,"Rahul Chahar to Moeen Ali, SIX, Ali tees off and oh, that's a poor effort from the fielder at long-off. Surely should have done better as he parries it away for a six. Looped up just outside off, Ali got underneath it and blasted it - didn't get it off the middle but fortunately gets away. Seemed like SKY was the fielder, who made a meal of it",Rahul Chahar to Moeen Ali,SIX
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,15.0,"Krunal Pandya to Moeen Ali, SIX, and he spoils the over with a maximum. Pandya gives a bit of flight, Ali extends his arms and clubs it over long-on.

8556956,RCB 1st Inns,15.4,"Behrendorff to Moeen Ali, SIX, he's started to tee off here. Behrendorff misses his mark, bowls a slower ball on a length. Ali was just waiting for this, backs his muscle power and smokes it over cow corner",Behrendorff to Moeen Ali,SIX
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,16.0,"Behrendorff to Moeen Ali, SIX, wow! This is a big over for RCB. Second six and 17 has come off it. Behrendorff fails to nail the yorker, misses it by an inch and Ali makes him pay. Gets under it and dumps it over cover",Behrendorff to Moeen Ali,SIX
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,17.2,"Malinga to de Villiers, SIX, ABD kneels and he will eventually bring you down on to your haunches. Stays low, and scoops the ball over fine leg for a huge six. Full marks to the anticipation and execution",Malinga to de Villiers,SIX
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,19.1,"Malinga to de Villiers, SIX, misses the yorker again, this time Malinga, and de Villiers has hammered it over deep square leg for a big six. Sized up for a length ball and got a full toss to scream it away",Malinga to de Villiers,SIX
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,4.3,"Behrendorff to Parthiv Patel, SIX, just over deep mid-wicket! Kishan was the fielder there and he leapt as much as he could but it went well over him. A taller fielder, Pollard perhaps, could have had a better chance. Take nothing away from Parthiv though, this is a cracking stroke. Picked the slower ball early and though he had to fetch it from outside off, did so with a cross-batted slap",Behrendorff to Parthiv Patel,SIX

9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,1.4,"Unadkat to Gayle, SIX, this was in the air for a long time, for a second the fielder at deep square leg looked in business but the breeze here in Mohali takes it away over the ropes. Probably, Archer - the fielder - was standing a few yards inside the rope, had he been near the boundary, he would've had a better chance of catching it. Big misjudgement from him there as Gayle gets away. It was banged in short, Gayle after a few sighters takes it on and pulls. Didn't time it as he would've liked but luckily, the ball sails over the ropes for a maximum",Unadkat to Gayle,SIX
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,1.5,"Unadkat to Gayle, SIX, after a few sighters, Gayle gets into action. Unadkat lands a length ball, sits up nicely for Gayle to free his arms. Whacked elegantly over long-on.

9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,14.3,"Unadkat to Miller, SIX, Bowled a rather decent spell in the last game against MI but he's back to leaking runs. Bowls a gift of a full toss on the pads and Miller with utter ease flicks it over deep mid-wicket. The timing was bang on!",Unadkat to Miller,SIX
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,14.5,"Unadkat to Rahul, SIX, Unadkat has run out of ideas! Rahul moves miles away from the leg stump and the bowler tries to follow him. Goes full though and the batsman goes inside out to clear covers with this exceptional shot. Wow!",Unadkat to Rahul,SIX

9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,20.0,"D Kulkarni to Ashwin, SIX, terrific cameo from Ashwin to finish! Premeditates the yorker and walks across the stumps early, thereby putting Kulkarni off. The result is a full toss that's paddle scooped beautifully. All the way over fine leg",D Kulkarni to Ashwin,SIX
9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,4.5,"D Kulkarni to Gayle, SIX, woah. This is very uncharacteristic from Gayle. Let's the world know about his cheekiness too.

9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,6.4,"Ish Sodhi to Agarwal, SIX, Agarwal at his very best. He's very good against spin and shows no respect whatsoever to Sodhi.

9956095,KXIP 1st Inns,7.4,"Shreyas Gopal to Agarwal, SIX, launched over long-off! Agarwal is looking in superb touch today. Tosses it enticingly just outside off, Agarwal props forward and clobbers it disdainfully for a maximum",Shreyas Gopal to Agarwal,SIX
9956095,RR 1st Inns,1.3,"Mujeeb to Buttler, SIX, dispatched over long-on! Clear intent from Buttler, doesn't want to settle Mujeeb settle.

9956095,RR 1st Inns,17.4,"Shami to Binny, SIX, there's nothing brute about this shot. Just a serene pick up off his hip, just watched the ball spear into the leg-side and did well to get inside the line and help the cherry on its way for a 75-metre maximum over fine leg",Shami to Binny,SIX

4183842,MI 1st Inns,6.0,"K Paul to Rohit, no ball, SIX, what was that? Seemed like it slipped out of Paul's hands. Delivers a waist-high full toss, Rohit gets into a great position and slams the pull towards deep square leg.

6274749,KXIP 1st Inns,8.3,"Chahal to Agarwal, SIX, skims over long-off's reach! Picked the googly there, which was overpitched anyway, and hammered it down the ground.

A proper mis-hit from Kishan, directs it into the night sky and Virat at long-off was setting himself near the boundary, but it gains some distance and loops over his head. Crazy",Navdeep Saini to Ishan Kishan,SIX
3434824,MI 1st Inns,19.3,"Udana to Ishan Kishan, SIX, butter fingers everywhere for RCB. Gurkeerat at long-on messes it up. Kishan muscled it flat and straight to him, he got both hands but couldn't lock it in time. Terrible.. and morever, he tips it over the bar for SIX",Udana to Ishan Kishan,SIX
3434824,MI 1st Inns,19.4,"Udana to Ishan Kishan, SIX, Ishan Kishan, you beauty.. connects and connects this one properly. Moves across his stumps and pummels it over long-on. Too predictable from Udana and Virat throws his head in anger. Rohit jumps from his chair. Oh! What's happening!",Udana to Ishan Kishan,SIX
3434824,MI 1st Inns,4.2,"Navdeep Saini to Ishan Kishan, SIX, shot! That's a fine hit from Kishan. Short and at the body, Kishan swivels and pulls, he got it right off the meat as the ball sailed over the long leg fence. The ball is lost in the stands and the fourth umpire brings out a box of replacement balls..",Navdeep Saini to Ishan Kishan,SIX
3434824,MI 1st Inns,7.5,"Zampa to Hardik Pandya, SIX, that's a horrible delivery. Zampa overcooks the delivery and it ends up as a full toss, Pandya does not need a second invitation, deposits it to the biggest part of the ground - to deep mid-wicket. Even some of his team mates were impressed on the distance he got",Zampa to Hardik Pandya,SIX
3434824,RCB 1st Inns,13.4,"Pattinson to Devdutt Padikkal, SIX, now that is some shot! Kohli hit a six over long-off in an international game and this is a little similar to that.

3434824,RCB 1st Inns,13.5,"Pattinson to Devdutt Padikkal, SIX, now the full flowing bat down the ground to loft Pattinson into the sightscreen. Devdutt Padikkal, what a talent.

3434824,RCB 1st Inns,16.3,"Bumrah to de Villiers, SIX, okay! Never bowl within the bodyline to AB when he's looking for quick runs. The slower ball sat into the surfaces, de Villiers hangs back and pulls over mid-wicket. Didn't bother running",Bumrah to de Villiers,SIX
3434824,RCB 1st Inns,17.0,"Bumrah to de Villiers, SIX, no Jas B! Unless you get that yorker right, it's difficult to control AB when you bowl into his body!

3434824,RCB 1st Inns,18.0,"Boult to de Villiers, SIX, just 4 runs off the over till this ball, so it should have been a smart delivery, but Boult, having got away with a short slower ball first delivery, tries again, but AB will feed on those anything within his bodyline at the end overs. Pulls, really high and into the stands over long leg",Boult to de Villiers,SIX
3434824,RCB 1st Inns,19.0,"Bumrah to de Villiers, SIX, how high was that hit? What a way to raise a fifty. Such a lovely player to watch at the death. Really interesting ploy from Bumrah to continue to bowl into AB's body than bowl outside off stump and make him to force pace. This is just a length delivery that's been absolutely muscled over deep square leg",Bumrah to de Villiers,SIX
3434824,RCB 1st Inns,19.2,"Pattinson to Shivam Dube, SIX, wow! Really nice cameo this from Dube. Knew Pattinson is going to bowl full and wide of off stump, read the slower delivery, got down on one knee and powered this over cover",Pattinson to Shivam Dube,SIX
3434824,RCB 1st Inns,19.3,"Pattinson to Shivam Dube, SIX, this is so stylish flicked! Stunning hit! Rohit folds hands and looks. Fullish and angled in, Dube just uses his hands on that to wrist it with a strong bottom hand grip, so easily clearing mid-wicket",Pattinson to Shivam Dube,SIX
3434824,RCB 1st Inns,2.4,"Boult to Finch, SIX, lovely, superbly played by Finch, length delivery outside off, he reached forward, got close to the ball, a clean extension of his arms and he drop kicks it over the long-off fence",Boult to Finch,SIX
3434824,RCB 1st Inns,20.0,"Pattinson to Shivam Dube, SIX, why? Just why? Coaches, experts plead not to bowl length at the death but Pattinson has bowled a slower ball halfway down the pitch. Dube stands tall and flat-bats it really straight. What a finish for RCB - 201",Pattinson to Shivam Dube,SIX
4969461,DC 1st Inns,12.5,"Abhishek Sharma to Pant, SIX, and there's the insult rubbed in .. Pant's not messing around, staying his ground and for a change not over-hitting as he manages a lovely bat flow in slogging it over cow corner",Abhishek Sharma to Pant,SIX

4969461,SRH 1st Inns,5.4,"Nortje to Warner, SIX, cracking shot, Warner breaks the shackles at last - change of pace on this cutter from Nortje, but the length was wide of off - Warner bends down on his knees and pumps the drive over cover - went a long way over the ropes for a maximum",Nortje to Warner,SIX
4969461,SRH 1st Inns,6.3,"Mishra to Bairstow, SIX, clubbed, nicely tossed up outside off, Bairstow gets down on his knees, picks the length early and plays the slog sweep over mid-wicket - hard, flat and over the ropes",Mishra to Bairstow,SIX
4969461,SRH 1st Inns,8.3,"Ishant to Warner, SIX, lovely, the slower ball from Ishant, but it's too full and right under Warner's arc - he clears his left leg and drills it back over the umpire's head, has enough power to sail over the ropes for a maximum",Ishant to Warner,SIX

5937426,DC 1st Inns,8.3,"Shreyas Gopal to Stoinis, SIX, Stoinis is making six-hitting look incredibly easy. Loopy delivery and he unleashes those muscular arms to club it flat over the extra cover fence",Shreyas Gopal to Stoinis,SIX
