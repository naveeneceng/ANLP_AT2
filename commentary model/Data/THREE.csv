2969824,KKR 1st Inns,13.5,"Zaheer to Y Pathan, 3 runs, 100-run stand between the duo. Another low full toss, Pathan gets underneath the delivery and drills it down the ground. Morris from long-off dives full length to his right and flicks the ball back in play. The other fielder (Nair) from long-on fires in a throw, but he can't stop the duo from taking the third. Excellent running",Zaheer to Y Pathan,THREE
7614896,RPS 1st Inns,6.2,"Harbhajan to Tripathi, 3 runs, Tripathi uses the extra bounce outside off and late-cuts it wide of the keeper. Mitch McClenaghan, runs, slides and flicks the ball back into play. Saved a run for his team there. 50-run stand between the duo as well",Harbhajan to Tripathi,THREE
7420225,SRH 1st Inns,2.0,"U Yadav to Warner, 3 runs, oh dearrrr! Chris Woakes makes a mess of it. Tough chance though. So lucky is Davey Warner here. This was a shortish slower ball from Umesh, Warner wanted to pull, totally mistimed it, the ball went high in the air over mid-on, Woakes runs back, seems to have misjudged and the ball already eluded him. Even a full length dive wasn't good enough. Hyderabad will breathe a big sigh of relief",U Yadav to Warner,THREE
9316064,MI 1st Inns,18.2,"Rabada to Hardik Pandya, 3 runs, dropped! First, Iyer spills one and then takes ages to release the ball. Allowing the duo to scamper back for the third. Short of length and Hardik is hurried on the flat-batted pull, spliced towards mid-off. Iyer rans back and tries to take it over his left shoulder, got both hands but the ball pops out",Rabada to Hardik Pandya,THREE
4550802,MI 1st Inns,11.0,"Ishant to Rohit, 3 runs, Comedy. Chaos. Everything happening out there. Rohit tucks it away towards mid-wicket and sets off for a second run. The fielder quickly gets to the ball, collects it and fires a throw at the non striker's end. There was an opportunity for a run-out had Ishant taken it cleanly. He fumbles and Rana gets back in. They also sneak in an extra run as there was no proper backing up",Ishant to Rohit,THREE
9414123,RR 1st Inns,15.5,"Ashwin to Buttler, 3 runs, in the air and Buttler gets away. Akshdeep Nath puts down a toughie. Buttler loses his shape and sends a leading edge into the night sky towards long-off. Nath sprinted forward, guess he picked it late as he saw Tiwary approaching from extra cover. Decided to go for it in the end, got both hands but shells it. Ashwin won't be happy",Ashwin to Buttler,THREE
9236293,MI 1st Inns,2.4,"Jofra Archer to Lewis, 3 runs, slogged high. Woah, it's checking the stratosphere. A cool ten seconds for it to come down, where Binny's done all the hard work of running back from mid-on .. to misjudge. Goes reverse cupped. There's never a good time to wait for anything, certainly not these swirlers",Jofra Archer to Lewis,THREE
9377212,SRH 1st Inns,12.1,"Searles to Dhawan, 3 runs, in the airr and Narine puts it down. Never looked like taking it any point, to be honest. So much so that he didn't even get a hand to it. A fat leading edge as Dhawan closes the bat face early on the whip, goes very high into the night sky and took an eternity to descend. The ball was swirling and the West Indian grasses it. Collects the ball and fires a direct-hit at the striker's end, it riochets away and they pinch three runs. They went upstairs for the run-out check but Dhawan was well in",Searles to Dhawan,THREE
8897809,MI 1st Inns,6.4,"Mishra to Pollard, 3 runs, edged and put down by Shaw. Mishra is not happy with the effort. Slips in the leggie and lured Pollard once again, who outside-edged it to first slip. Shaw leapt, it was sailing over his head. Gets a finger-tip to it and it runs away towards third man. What a miss for Delhi!",Mishra to Pollard,THREE
8593147,SRH 1st Inns,2.4,"Chahar to Williamson, 3 runs, MS tries a funky flick-the-ball-to-the-stumps and it backfires, Goswami was a goner there! Flicked away to the left of deep square, Bhajji picks it late after a marathon-like sprint and what was Williamson thinking there? No three there tbh, but they decided to take on Bhajji's arm. It came flat and high which tempted MSD to try one of his tried-and-tested tacticts to run Goswami out. Unfortunately, missed by a big margin. Goswami wasn't even in the frame",Chahar to Williamson,THREE
2331682,KKR 1st Inns,19.1,"K Paul to Chawla, 3 runs, in the air...falls safe! Rabada and Tewatia were after the chance, was ideally the South African's catch but his mate tries with a dive, only to get nowhere near the ball. Chawla had got the timing wrong once again on the loft but survives. Excellent running gives KKR three more",K Paul to Chawla,THREE
8556956,RCB 1st Inns,16.1,"Bumrah to de Villiers, 3 runs, lofts the low full toss over the bowler's head and a misfield from Pollard allows the duo to take a triple. Fifty for de Villiers. It has been labourious by his standards but now is the time, when he can cash in",Bumrah to de Villiers,THREE
5568908,SRH 1st Inns,11.4,"Narine to Bairstow, 3 runs, and another drop! Slog sweep attempted, and was a fot top-edge for the man at deep backward to drop it. He never even got close to it. Such a poor effort from Gurney. KKR are on a free fall",Narine to Bairstow,THREE
2412742,CSK 1st Inns,16.0,"Nortje to Dhoni, 3 runs, uppish guide to this short delivery past backward point, they race back for three",Nortje to Dhoni,THREE
3434824,MI 1st Inns,17.0,"Zampa to Pollard, 3 runs, in the air.. another chance and Chahal this time makes a meal of it. What are RCB doing? Very poor.. Pollard looks to go for another biggie, gets a thick edge which goes up towards backward point. Chahal circles around, never looked comfortable and worse is.. doesn't even get a hand on it. Phew!",Zampa to Pollard,THREE
8969749,RCB 1st Inns,18.2,"Unadkat to Kohli, 3 runs, 129kph, Unadkat probably saw the batter step down and shortened his length. Kohli checks his lofted drive and the ball falls short of in-running-and-diving Gopal at long-off. Meanwhile, Kohli runs three by the time Gopal recovers and releases the ball. Just incredible stuff...",Unadkat to Kohli,THREE
1044022,SRH 1st Inns,4.2,"Shami to Bairstow, 3 runs, dropped! Great effort from KL at mid-off but these need to stick if KXIP are to make a comeback. Dived full-length to his right and also got his right hand to it but it didn't stick. Parried it all the way towards the deep before it was hauled back in. Bairstow is living dangerously here, stepped down for the flat-batted hit, didn't keep it down and would be happy that it didn't go to hand",Shami to Bairstow,THREE
