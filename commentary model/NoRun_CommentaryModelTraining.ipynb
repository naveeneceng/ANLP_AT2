            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Punjab have gone for a review. {{BATSMAN}} is a long way down the ground. Ultra edge shows no edge and DRS shows ball is just hitting the leg stump. Punjab retains the review again. {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track on the ball and misses the bat totally, ball hits his pads\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, a review for LBW. Looks high to the naked eye but gee that's hit {{BATSMAN}} on the back pad, above the knee roll. Carrom ball I think, which skids on instead of turning away. Beats the batsman for pace and goes through {{BATSMAN}}, who's standing on his back foot to meet that. Ball-tracking is in and it's umpire's call on height, as suspected\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, chance and dropped, that's a dolly and Markande has somehow dropped it. Then slower short ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swivelled across on the pull, doesn't get hold of the shot and hit it straight to mid-on. It came at a very good height, Markande went reverse cupped and somehow let the ball pop out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BATSMAN}} went for an across the line shot, and he was hit on the pads. He just managed to get an inside edge to it and that saved him there. An excellent over from {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, direct-hit and Nair would've been on his way back to the hut. Patel gets an inside edge onto his pad, the ball drops into the off-side. {{BOWLER}} rushes forward, collects the ball and sees Nair stuttering at the middle of the pitch. Picks up and rifles a throw at the non-striker's end, but misses the target\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, the inside edge saved the southpaw. Length delivery angling in, {{BATSMAN}} hopped back to defend and missed it. But there was an inside edge and that helped him overturn the umpire's decision which was out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, chance and Rohit has dropped it - fair to say, he has saved four runs - short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} rocked back and drilled the pull, to the left of mid-wicket. Rohit moved across quickly, got both hands on the ball, but can't hold on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, now then, there's a review from KKR for leg-before. {{BATSMAN}} didn't pick a googly from {{BOWLER}} and was hit on the back pad. But in real time, it looked like the impact may have been outside off. Oh wait, there's an inside edge too. So that's that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BATSMAN}} has been given out LBW and he immediately reviews. I think it's pitching well outside leg, a shocker from umpire Nandan and feel this will be overturned. No bat on that and it's confirmed by Ultraedge. Hawk-Eye will confirm my doubt and it has pitched miles outside leg. NOT OUT is the call. Poor decision from umpire Nandan and the crowd cheer as NOT OUT flashes on the screen. {{BATSMAN}} was looking to whip a full ball on his pads and missed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Steve Smith thinks {{BATSMAN}} has got an outside edge to it. And Rahane has showed trust in the Australian, he has gone for a review. {{BATSMAN}} has missed it by a country mile. And I have no clue what Smith heard there. It proved to be a horrible decision as there was a huge gap between the bat and the pad. It was a good length delivery wide of off and it beats the outside edge of {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BATSMAN}} given out on the field, but he's reviewed it. He got into a terrible position against a cracking bouncer from {{BOWLER}}, just left his hands up there, and according to umpire Gould it brushed his glove on the way. But there's nothing on Ultra-Edge. However, the third umpire still goes through to check if there's any visible deflection. That's interesting. Still, he can't find much to uphold the onfield call. So the decision will have to be overturned\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, good review in the end by DK. Got flummoxed by the fastish leg break, got pinged on the back pad as well with the turn and fizz doing him in. The umpire was late in raising his finger and {{BATSMAN}} chose to go for the review, almost out of hope. He probably was banking on the turn to save him and that's precisely what happens. HawkEye shows to be going over the stumps\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, was that a chance? {{BATSMAN}} backed away and {{BOWLER}} followed him. Got a bit of turn and {{BATSMAN}} missed the cut. The keeper failed to catch it cleanly. Not sure if there was any bat involved\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BOWLER}} drops it! Such an easy caught and bowled chance, but KG has put it down. {{BATSMAN}} had chipped it right back to the bowler who got his palms to it, but nothing more. Maybe, he got deceived due to the trajectory as the ball was dipping on him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, almost thumped it back to {{BOWLER}}. Flatter offie around, {{BATSMAN}} hangs back and punches it straight down the wicket, did not keep it down the ground, {{BOWLER}} is late to react, the ball hits his upper part of his hand and goes to ground. Tough chance but should have been taken\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped! {{BOWLER}} almost gets another one. Finch the culprit on this occasion. Squared him up completely with the length delivery and induced an outside edge too. However, Finch at second slip makes a mess of it! This was a straight-forward catch for Gayle. Double wicket-maiden for {{BOWLER}}. Absolute gold!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, a direct-hit at the bowler's end and Kohli was gone! This was driven to Ashwin at mid-on by {{BATSMAN}} and Kohli was almost halfway down the track. Ash had plenty of time to aim and go for the direct-hit at the bowler's end, but he couldn't pull it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, chance and Parthiv has shelled it, it was a tough chance, he was standing up to the batsman, on a good length and well wi{{BOWLER}} of off, {{BATSMAN}} went for the flamboyant drive, got a feather and Parthiv grabbed at that, it popped out and he had a second bite at the cherry, but can't hold on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BATSMAN}} reviews! He was adjudged lbw here by the umpire, but he has straight away signaled for a review. Think there was some bat on it, as I look at the replays. Was a low full toss on leg that {{BATSMAN}} failed to middle. Luckily for him there was some bat on it. So the onfield decision has to be overturned. The original decision was out, hence although he got some bat on it, it will be called as a dead ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, yes-no and the last thing {{TEAM}} want is for {{BATSMAN}} to run AB out. Thankfully no damage done. He defends this back of a length delivery towards cover-point and blindly sets off, AB rightly sends him back and Stoinis' throw wasn't accurate at the striker's end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, edged and dropped, that was a chance and Warner at first slip has missed it. It was a tough opportunity though, {{BATSMAN}} went with hard hands, the edge was flying and to the right of the captain, he went with hard hands and shells it. Coming to the ball, it was tossed up invitingly outside off, another wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}}, lured {{BATSMAN}} into the mistake - but {{BATSMAN}} survives\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, run-out chance missed! {{BATSMAN}} is struggling out in the middle. The required run rate is out of their reach now! He was trying to flick the slider but got struck on his pads. Rana wanted a single but the striker wasn't up for it. Nitish was almost halfway down the track and had {{BOWLER}} collected the throw from Parthiv, it would have been curtains for him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, direct hit at the striker's end and {{BATSMAN}} was gone. But as luck would have it, Cummins missed the target. It was again a short ball and {{BATSMAN}} went for the pre-meditated hook, could not get behind the shot and ended up deflecting off the face of the bat toward mid-wicket. Was blinded through the motion and did not spot where the ball went. Heard the call late but was back in time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, leading edge lands short of Bhuvi at point. And there's some confusion in the running but Barman gets back in safely at the non-striker's end. Lures {{BATSMAN}} into playing an across-the-line-heave, loses shape as the ball sharply turns away and it drops a couple of inches in front of SRH's captain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, a flat in-turner and {{BATSMAN}} missed the glance. Legal ball and no bat involved. HawkEye shows it to be going over leg. So, Chennai lose their review! The height was always a factor as it struck {{BATSMAN}} on the front leg above the knee-roll\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped! {{BOWLER}} has landed badly it seems. Was a fairly straightforward chance though and he spilled it. {{BATSMAN}} used his feet for the lofted hit and ended up stroking it straight back at {{BOWLER}} who reacted quickly, had two bites at the cherry but couldn't cling on. Would have been a massive wicket for DC\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, the keeper got excited as soon as he caught the ball and that induced a review from Kohli. Big legbreak from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} looked to flay it flat on the off-side, misses it by a whisker and there was a slightest bit of deviation after pitching which got RCB excited\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Bairstow puts down a catch! Was a googly outside off and {{BATSMAN}} got an outside edge as he tried to punch off the back foot. The keeper shows some generosity by not holding on to the catch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, was there a nick? There was a certain deviation and also, a faint noise. I guess, the reaction of {{BOWLER}} suggests that there was an edge. So, will go down as a drop. Guess, who's the culprit? It's the skipper, DK. Googly, turning away from {{BATSMAN}}, who went for the drive. Scraps the outside edge, straight in and out of DK's gloves. Costly drop? Surely\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Saha has dropped it! Could have been the second wicket for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} tried to work that short delivery away to the on side but got a thick inside edge. Saha behind the wickets makes a mess of it as the Delhi skipper gets a life\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped! Hardus Viljeon is the fielder. Full and swinging into the pads, {{BATSMAN}} unleashes his whippy wrists and sends a dolly of a catch to mid-wicket where Viljeon makes an absolute Bisi Bele Bath (dal rice) out of it. Oh dear!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, clipped to the left of mid-wicket and they think of a quick single, Suryakumar Yadav was quick to gather the ball and he missed the direct hit at the batting end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, good use of the technology by {{BATSMAN}}! He was very sure that he had hit it and UltraEdge confirms the inside edge. He was stuck on the crease to this inswinger and got pinged on the back leg. Cannot fault the umpire for raising his finger because if not for the edge, it was dead plumb\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, what happened there? Miller has spilled this one. Ill-timed jump and he manages to grab a left hand to it and the ball doesn't stick. He leapt up too early and in the end only had to go with a left-hand. {{BATSMAN}} gets a life here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, CSK review for LBW, but looks like it was missing off stump, or maximum shaving off stump. Umpire's call will do for the batsman. Was the googly, so tough to be out LBW from over the wicket, oh yes, ball-tracker says missing off stump. {{BATSMAN}} went for the big sweep and missed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped! Oh, Pant! He would be gutted not to have held onto this one. What a moment it would have been for DD! The slider which goes across {{BATSMAN}} with the angle, he pushed with hard hands and got a tiny feather, it went rapidly to the left of Pant and smacked him on the leg. Tough one, but goes down as a chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, brilliant work from Henriques. A direct-hit would've been interesting. A fuller length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} pushes it meekly towards extra cover, Moises dives to his right and throws at the non-striker, all in one motion. DK was backing up for a single and had to turn back and dive full-length to make his ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped. Pops out of Shaw's hands at square leg like a bar of soap. He got a lifeline when he was batting and now this. Karma eh? A strong wristy whip from {{BATSMAN}}, hitting it on the up and straight to Shaw, who couldn't lock his hands in time and grasses it. {{BATSMAN}} will breathe easy.. you can't drop these catches at this level\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, and {{BOWLER}} ji has dropped a tough one! That was muscled back to the bowler. Quicker one outside off and was spanked back to the bowler who got both hands to it before dropping it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped, it's the Australian captain who has dropped his vice-captain. An Englishman looks aghast. Length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} got a big stride forward and drilled it straight to Smith at mid-off, in and out, that was a sitter\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Parthiv Patel was in some trouble here but puts in a dive as the throw at the bowler's end misses. Might have been 50-50 if it hit. Shortish {{BATSMAN}}livery that struck {{BATSMAN}} on the thigh pad as he got cramped on the flick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Ashwin reviews. Makes sure first with the keeper that it was straight enough and then goes for it. Last ball from {{BOWLER}} was the one that shaped away and beat {{BATSMAN}}, and this straightened and slithered on to rap {{BATSMAN}}'s front pad's flap. But tell you what, this is just a bit naff, this review. Pitches almost a foot outside leg-stump, and it's not out -- just as the on-field umpire thought\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped by Kohli diving at mid-on. Dove too far actually. Ended up hitting his wrist. Drilled by {{BATSMAN}} and the RCB skipper got both hands and spilled it. Isn't happy with himself at all\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, a loud shout for LBW and SRH will review. The angle means this ball must have pitched outside leg. Think so, can see all the three stumps, no bat for sure and UltraEdge confirms it. But it has pitched marginally outside leg and SRH lose their review. Good delivery to complete the spell, the slower dipping yorker from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to shovel it over the leg-side and is done by the late dip, struck low and in front of the leg-stump\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, just short of Raina at cover, dropped short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} made room for the punch and didn't bother to keep it down, almost carried to cover as raina tumbled forward\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, just doesn't stick. Zak has to give himself the stare here. Lets off the big man after inducing him into a false stroke. Misreads the slower one here does {{BATSMAN}} and is way early into a whack. Chips it back to the bowler, who in his followthrough gets both palms to it. Just doesn't stick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, inswinger on a length around leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} looks to get some tickle on that but fails to make any contact off the bat. It brushes the thigh pad and flies to PP to his left, Kohli checked with his bowler and keeper and then went up for the review\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, yorker outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} fails to get bat on ball. Ishan Kishan fumbles and CdG looks for a quick bye, comically he loses balance and stumbles to get back. Ishan Kishan misses and the Kiwi gets away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, a review for LBW. Looks high to the naked eye but gee that's hit {{BATSMAN}} on the back pad, above the knee roll. Carrom ball I think, which skids on instead of turning away. Beats the batsman for pace and goes through {{BATSMAN}}, who's standing on his back foot to meet that. Ball-tracking is in and it's umpire's call on height, as suspected\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BOWLER}} has won here. Not with a wicket yet, but with a review. Implored Rohit, convinced him, and the captain yielded. On first sighting, that's going down leg. Arm-ball that {{BATSMAN}}'s trying to sweep. Misses and is hit on the front pad. Ball-tracking suggests that the impact is on leg-stump, so with the left-armer's angle from round the wicket, that must be going down. Is actually. Not out. Review wasted.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, did that carry to Tiwary? Oh what a big wicket that would have been. Round the wicket, slanting the ball in on a back of length and getting it to straighten a touch. {{BATSMAN}} fences it to slip. Oh, this is close. It might have just fallen short. Centimetres\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, flat and fast on off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} forces it straight back at Jaddu who couldn't cling onto a return catch\n",
            "Markan{{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Yuvraj Singh, what have you done?. He's dropped {{BATSMAN}} first ball. Flatter {{BATSMAN}}livery outsi{{BATSMAN}} off stump, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to punch off the back foot, gets a thick edge that travels, Yuvi moved to his right and the ball came to the left and hit the knee\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Review time: {{BATSMAN}} has been given out lbw. And he has taken the review. I don't reckon there is an inside edge on it. UltraEdge will confirm it. And there is a spike on UltraEdge. Just a tiny bit but that will be enough to save {{BATSMAN}}. Rod Tucker will have to change his decision. It nips back in off the deck, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to heave it to the on-side, plays it down the wrong line and it raps him on the pads. It looked plumb to the naked eye but an inside edge saves {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, appeal for caught behind and he's been given. AB reviews immediately. He checks with the umpire about what the {{BATSMAN}}cision was for. The umpire informs him he's given him caught behind. There was a noise as the ball passed the bat, but clearly the ball just touched the flap of the pad and was nowhere close to the bat or glove. It was a short of length {{BATSMAN}}livery outsi{{BATSMAN}} off stump, {{BATSMAN}} tried to gui{{BATSMAN}} that to third man and missed. DRS saves {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, SRH have gone for a review for a caught behind. There is surely gap between the bat and the pad. And I will be very surprised, if something comes up in UltraEdge. There is nothing on UltraEdge. And SRH will lose their review too. It was a brilliant delivery nevertheless, it was on a good length and it snaked back in after hitting the deck. {{BATSMAN}} played it down the wrong line and it went between his bat and pad. Manish Pandey strangely heard something and he was the one who pushes Williamson to go for the review!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped! Quicker delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} cuts it and gets a thick outside edge. Saha couldn't hold onto the catch. Wasn't an easy one either\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, good review in the end from {{BATSMAN}}! Fell across a bit on the flick and missed the indipper to get pinged on the front pad. The umpire didn't waste any time in raising his finger for the LBW but {{BATSMAN}} wanted to review it. Height was the only thing that could have bailed him out and even that didn't look likely in real time. However, the nature of the Wankhede surface aids Jinks in the end as HawkEye shows it to be going over the sticks\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, slower length ball on off, {{BATSMAN}} defends back towards the bowler and sets off for a single. Ridiculous judgement. Karthik obviously sends him back, but even a dive wouldn't have saved him if {{BOWLER}} had hit the stumps direct. Michael Clarke calls it the worst attempted single in the history of cricket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, lucky is {{BATSMAN}}! That was scooped back to the bowler who lets it pop out. Dolly of a catch it was as the batsman pushed it back on the clipped drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, was that a drop? Need another look. Wide yorker outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends down to squeeze it out, the ball takes the under-edge and goes low to Dhoni's right. The former skipper goes with one hand and spills it. Tough one for Dhoni and {{BOWLER}}'s unlucky day continues, second drop off his bowling\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, the appeal was so loud and confident that the umpire was under a lot of pressure, fair on KXIP's part because they thought it was a genuine edge, but the fact that {{BATSMAN}} immediately smiled and reviewed clearly suggested he didn't hit this. Maybe the ump should have originally given the benefit of doubt to the batsman, because the bat also hit the ground. Wide yorker, {{BATSMAN}} tried to squeeze, missed it completely and there's no spike on UltraEdge. Review saves {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, was there an edge? QDK can't collect it cleanly and yes, there was a definite bottom-edge there. Googly from {{BOWLER}}, dropped short and it was spinning away from {{BATSMAN}}. He went for the pull a tad early and feeds a tiny edge but QDK messes it behind, grassing it onto the floor\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, was there an edge on that? Yes, but it was too fast - even for someone like MSD - pushed through flatter and quicker of off, stayed a tad low as well - {{BATSMAN}} was back on the punch, gets a toe-end that rolls off MSD's pads\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Very fancy shot to attempt off someone like {{BOWLER}} who fizzes the ball through. But the impact is probably just outside off which has saved him. SRH aren't convinced with the umpire's call, so they go for a review. Only to waste it. Flat leg-break just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to scoop it over the keeper's head, but wasn't able to connect\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, that was full, wide, {{BATSMAN}} threw his bat it and misses. There was a noise, MS went for the DRS but there was nothing on the UltraEdge. Mo continues..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped! The penalty you pay for fielding a part-time wicket-keeper. The flatter knuckle ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} moved away to the leg-side and tried to force it off the back foot, the outside edge goes straight in and straight out of Uthappa's gloves. That would have been two set batsmen removed in one over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, uh oh! A bad mix-up there with {{BATSMAN}} being sent back from the middle of the pitch. But he makes it home. The throw isn't a great one from Pathan either. Rana called him initially but then backtracked as {{BATSMAN}} steered it to point. These are nervy times\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, interesting stuff. SRH have gone for the review for LBW. Leg-break straightening and the sweep takes the glove on it's way! The appeal was for an LBW, but there was glove on it. It actually came off the glove, but the keeper has dropped it.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BOWLER}} is excited but that looks high. Traps {{BATSMAN}} on the shuffle with this delivery. Oh they've gone for the review. It's hit the knee-roll bang in front of off-stump, so the impact is alright. But as we doubted, the bounce in this Jaipur deck is taking the ball over the stumps -- the ball-tracking confirms. So not out it'll be and Mumbai lose their review\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BOWLER}} is jumping for an lbw appeal. Does not get it and Gambhir takes it. To the naked eye, looked like an under edge. Need UltraEdge to confirm. No bat. So we move on. Impact? Outside the line and that is such a poor review and DD burn their only review. Was very full to be sweeping, {{BATSMAN}} went for it and managed to get himself outside the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, this is a very wide short ball, {{BATSMAN}} tried to fetch the pull shot, missed, the ball sneaked under the under edge, Karthik was confident in his appeal, given out and {{BATSMAN}} overturned the call by reviewing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, brilliant work from Henriques. A direct-hit would've been interesting. A fuller length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} pushes it meekly towards extra cover, Moises dives to his right and throws at the non-striker, all in one motion. DK was backing up for a single and had to turn back and dive full-length to make his ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, and this call, if upheld, could seal the game. Faf given out LBW to a googly from {{BOWLER}}. He's gone for the review. This is shady, as the ball seems to be a bit leg-sidish. You can see middle and off stump when it hit the pad. Williamson has already got his fielders in position, so he doesn't seem very confident. Yes, as expected, it's missing leg stump. Faf survives. {{TEAM}} still alive, if only just\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Saha completed the catch and went up immediately. {{BOWLER}} joined him as well. Williamson trusting his players challenged the decision, but it remains with the onfield call. {{BATSMAN}} steps out and is tucked by the drifter, misses the nudge into the on-side and the ball lobs off the pad to the left of Saha. He moves across to catch that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, excellent use of technology and {{BATSMAN}} survives! Height was the factor that could have saved him but in the end, inside edge does. Was a lovely nipbacker from {{BOWLER}} that pinged {{BATSMAN}} on the back pad. Didn't look dead plumb but the umpire was impressed and raised his finger. After a chat with Guptill, {{BATSMAN}} opted for the DRS and it has saved him in the end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, edged and dropped, that was a chance and Warner at first slip has missed it. It was a tough opportunity though, {{BATSMAN}} went with hard hands, the edge was flying and to the right of the captain, he went with hard hands and shells it. Coming to the ball, it was tossed up invitingly outside off, another wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}}, lured {{BATSMAN}} into the mistake - but {{BATSMAN}} survives\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, oh is that a dropped chance? Yes it was. It's the set Watto. Full delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} drives hard and hits it back at the bowler, who doesn't accept the offer\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, a hat-trick of dots, you are kidding me! Slower delivery again that spins across, {{BATSMAN}} pokes at it and misses. MI review just like that, obviously no edge on that. Gee this is unbelievable stuff\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped! That was a tough chance as it was struck hard by {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} hardly had any time to react there. Got his right hand to it but failed to cling on. He's in some pain, in fact he's going off the field. How costly a blow will that be for Kings XI? He has been one of their best bowlers this season.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, has Karun plucked a one-handed stunner? The third umpire is called for, the soft call is OUT. Looked like a good catch on first view. Has the ball touched the ground, has he got his fingers underneath? The third umpire is having a look at different angles, this will be a tricky call. NOT OUT it is. Fair call, looked like the ball might just have touched the ground as Karun plucked it. Coming to the ball, it was full and shaping away, squared up {{BATSMAN}} as he was looking to work it towards the on-side, the edge flew to the left of first slip. Karun stuck his left hand out and claimed the catch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BOWLER}} is a smart operator and he will mix it up. Important to read him from the hand rather the surface. {{BATSMAN}} did not pick the off-break and lunged forward to nudge it into the on-side, beaten on the inside edge and struck around the kneeroll. The big press forward helped him there as ball-tracking showed it to be going over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Hyderabad review: Not an obvious googly - yup, it's the leggie, but the obvious missed slog-sweep. And {{BATSMAN}}'s struck on his back thigh pad in front of leg. Many questions here - where's it pitching? Where's it heading? Again, like it was in the first innings, it's taking ages to load the replays for the third umpire. Poor internet speed somewhere in Kolkata, check the fiber cables .. anyway, the front foot is cleared out. Oh and the impact is just down leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BATSMAN}} is looking very nervous, pushes a length ball straight to Uthappa at short extra-cover and set-off for a quick single. Dhawan wasn't coming this time, {{BATSMAN}} has to turn around, put the dive and make his ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Pollard drops it! It was an off-cutter on a back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to clear mid-off but he mistimed it badly. Pollard at mid-off dives dramatically to his right but fails to time his dive to perfection and ends up spilling it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, chance of a run-out, but {{BOWLER}} has made a mess of it. Tewatia was almost at the striker's end when {{BATSMAN}} asked him to go back. But, {{BOWLER}} couldn't get rid of the ball quickly. Had he gone for a direct-hit at the bowler's end, Tewatia could have been in trouble. The throw wasn't an impressive one, as he parried it away towards the fielder who was charging in from mid-off. Was delivered on the pads as {{BATSMAN}} failed to connect his flick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, put down. Oh {{BOWLER}}. Gets the ball to stick on the surface making {{BATSMAN}} stand back and check his push. Chips it meekly in the end off a straight batted defence, straight to the bowler. Doesn't quite anticipate the sharp dip on this does Bhajji as he barely stoops low. An out-popper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run. Another appeal for lbw and this time CSK decide to review. Fair delivery. The knuckle ball and {{BATSMAN}} didn't pick it. Was early into the shot and got struck on the back thigh. Was there any bat involved? A light spike on the UltraEdge. An inside edge. CSK lose their only review. It was on a length and {{BATSMAN}} walked forward to work it through the on-side. Didn't pick it, on that occasion did {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped! {{BOWLER}} has put down a tough return catch. A back of a length delivery on the stumps and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to slap it straight down the ground. Doesn't get the required elevation and it went to the bowler at a catchable height. {{BOWLER}} went with both hands in his followthrough, but the ball didn't stick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, a direct hit there would have been curtains for {{BATSMAN}}. The southpaw shuffled across and tucked this length ball to short fine and set off for a quick single. Dhoni wasn't interested and sent him back. Kulkarni had all three stumps to aim, but missed the target at the striker's end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Is {{BATSMAN}} gone? The umpire has given him out caught behind. But {{BATSMAN}} was quick to review it. That nipped in, {{BATSMAN}} pushed at it and seems to have missed it. Mostly it went off the pads and into the keeper's gloves. Not out is the verdict and {{BATSMAN}} is safe. Even he was safe on the LBW call as it was missing the wickets\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BATSMAN}} reviews a caught behind: You'd think when he reviews from behind the stumps, he'd know when he hasn't nicked it. It was the typical strategy -- short, incoming bouncer, which MS pulls and apparently gloves away to the keeper. Nope, clear daylight between glove and ball, and more daylight between bat and ball. But there was a noise, which probably was his clicking bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, DK has been given out lbw. By umpire Nand Kishore. Looks a dodgy decision. That's why the {{TEAM}} skipper went for the review straight away. UltraEdge shows a big spike and the crowd cheer. Huge inside edge onto the pads. How did Nand Kishore miss that? {{BOWLER}} was pumped, but all that celebration now turns sour! Was a length delivery cutting back in, raps {{BATSMAN}} above the kneeroll, but there was an edge before that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped! Deja vu! Watto was dropped in the first over at first slip and he does the same now. A beautiful delivery from {{BOWLER}}. Seam-up delivery on a good-ish length that decks away a tad and {{BATSMAN}} dangled his bat out. The thick outside edge carries to Watson, but that's been put down. {{BATSMAN}} survives. The centurion wasn't quite ready - was late to react\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped first ball! What a beginning that would've been to the game. Straight in and straight out. Deepak Hooda at short cover who got both hands and then it went out. Was a fairly straightforward chance too. Driven in the air and {{BATSMAN}} gets lucky\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Mumbai review this given LBW: Full, straightening back in off the pitch, and {{BATSMAN}}'s trapped on the front pad in his crease. But, but, the impact's in front of leg-stump, and ball-tracking shows it to be going down leg. False alarm, and {{BATSMAN}} will stay there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped! The odds of this happening are high when you field a non-regular keeper. {{BATSMAN}} pokes at a turning off-break and gets an outside edge. Uthappa fails to gobble it up. How costly is that going to be?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, appeal for LBW and {{BOWLER}} prods his captain to go for the review. It's a fair delivery and replays suggest that there was some bat on that. Ultraedge confirms it and KKR have lost their review. This was very full and on the leg-stump line, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to sweep and the inside edge perhaps saved him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, quick skidder. {{BATSMAN}}'s done in, struck on his pad. And the umpire gives into {{BOWLER}}'s celebratory LBW appeal. Tripathi doesn't allow him to leave, forces him to review. So {{BATSMAN}}'s well deep in the crease, doesn't read the googly, is beaten on pace as well. But he's struck on the front pad. And yes .. the angle is enough to take it down leg.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, oh nearly.. A communication breakdown between both the batsmen almost resulted in a run-out. A short of length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slashed it straight to point, Kulkarni set off for a single, DK was ball-watching and sends him back. Yuvi, the fielder, was slow to react and fires a throw at the non-strikers end, misses the target and Kulkarni survives\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, was it a chance for {{BATSMAN}} Kock? He's having a off-day behind the stumps today. Well, looks like there wasn't any edge there. So, won't go down as a drop. It was tossed up luringly outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to have a piece of it as he threw his bat without any feet movement but the ball straightened and beats his outsi{{BATSMAN}} edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Punjab have gone for a review. My naked eyes tell me this is high and it might be going down the leg side. {{BATSMAN}} is jumping in the crease when ball strikes him on the back pad. It is clipping the stumps -- the top of middle and leg -- but just clipping so it is umpire's call and Punjab retain their review. Good inward shape from {{BOWLER}} on that back of a length ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, chance and dropped. Shaun Marsh is the culprit, he had two bites at the cherry, but can't hold on. Length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drilled it towards cover, Marsh tumbled to his right and let the ball slip, he was alert though, turned around and tried to grab the rebound, but can't do so. He had it for a moment, but the ball popped out as his elbows hit the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, a peach. Oh it doesn't get better. And to imagine it coming in the death in the midst of an onslaught. Oh and amidst all this noise, the umpire's heard a tickle. He's given him caught behind. But {{BATSMAN}} isn't amused, he goes up instantly. Why bother consulting your partner with 10 balls to go in the day. And UltraEdge is a murmur all through, but when it passes the bat it gets a little bigger. The sound's deaf. Oh and forget the spikes, the third umpire overturns\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, KKR review: They have decided to challenge the umpire's call against {{BATSMAN}}. But for me, it's clearly pitching outside leg. Was the googly that beat the batsman's flick and struck him on the pads. Might have crashed into the stumps but if it's pitching outside leg, it makes no sense. Awful review by KKR. Not out is the final verdict\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} swings so hard that the bat flies out of his hand, he then tries to steal a bye with the bat lying near square leg and Karthik misses to run him out. He was gone by a mile, in the end they don't even go through with the run\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Ishant spills a sitter! Embarrassing stuff from DC's senior man. {{BATSMAN}} shuffled well across for the sweep and skewed it aerially to short fine leg. Straightforward take but Ishant spills it. How costly will this be?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, ripper from {{BOWLER}}, absolute ripper. So good was the ball, that they feel compelled to go for a review after {{BATSMAN}} is beaten on the outside edge. He's missed this by inches. Only clipped the trouser on the way through. Oh well, SRH have retained their review because ball-tracking shows it to be umpire's call on off stump. I'm sure they weren't appealing for leg-before there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Thakur, again. A direct hit would have been curtains for Pant! The run was definitely not on. {{BATSMAN}} slightly backed away and {{BOWLER}} followed him with a short of length ball, thereby cramping him for room. It was punched towards mid-on. A yes-no situation and Pant put in a desperate dive. Luckily, the fielder failed to hit the target\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, close call! But umpire Anantha Padmanabhan is a happy man. The slider which skids on and pings {{BATSMAN}} on the front pad before deflecting onto the back, he played for the turn when there wasn't any. Ball-tracking showed it to be clipping leg-stump\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, a flat in-turner and {{BATSMAN}} missed the glance. Legal ball and no bat involved. HawkEye shows it to be going over leg. So, Chennai lose their review! The height was always a factor as it struck {{BATSMAN}} on the front leg above the knee-roll\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, oh Tiwary. He puts down another. This time it goes right in, only to pop out. A fierce slap this from {{BATSMAN}} finding extra cover to perfection. Just that the catch cannot stick in his palms tonight\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, in the air and dropped! Mohit Sharma is the culprit. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to clear mid-off, fails to do so and ends up hitting it straight to Mohit at mid-off. It was hit hard and Mohit fails to get his fingers in the right position to grab it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, pacy short ball from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} is a bit surprised by that, he is late on the pull/hook and the ball flies over the top-edge. Buttler went up but {{BOWLER}} gestured he didn't hear anything\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, that did not look close. Not sure what made {{BOWLER}} go for the review. The leg-break and {{BATSMAN}} misses the sweep, the ball misses the front pad and strikes the back thigh, impact was always one of the issues and the turn took it past off-stump\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, spills a return catch. {{BATSMAN}} hits it straight back at him but it's not coming too fast and the height is pretty comfortable too. He should have taken it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, fuller length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} hits it straight to cover, he wanted a single but Akshdeep Nath wasn't interested at all. And when the fielder picked up the ball {{BATSMAN}} was almost in the mid crease, he had given up but throw was wayward and {{BATSMAN}} gets away with it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped -- Shreyas Iyer of all people -- and it just doesn't get simpler. {{BATSMAN}} drives uppishly, hard, finds extra cover, where Iyer reverse cups, and is a little too casual\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, KKR's LBW review. {{BOWLER}} gets this to rip in big, beats {{BATSMAN}}'s flick and finds his front pad. Now, it's struck him in front of leg, it's hit the knee roll as well in a massive stride. But it's not needed much convincing for the bowler or DK to take it up. In fact it's missed the leg-stump by another cool two stumps\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped! Can you believe it? CSK's best fielder has put one down. {{BATSMAN}} slapped the shortish delivery to mid-off where Jadeja spills it out. He tried to take it on the second attempt too, but failed even then\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, chance and Tye has dropped a dolly. That should have been four for {{BOWLER}}, short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swivelled across and nailed the pull, straight into the hands of Tye at mid-wicket - who somehow clangs a sitter\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, a chance and Pant has dropped it, that was a regulation catch and Pant didn't go down with the ball - stood tall and fluffed it - the leg-break and {{BATSMAN}} pushed at it, straight in and out of Pant's gloves\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, KKR review! Has {{BATSMAN}} nicked it? Or did it come off the jersey? There was a certain sound but don't think it came off the willow. Or is it the trouser? Waiting for the replays. There's a spike on UltraEdge but not sure whether it's the inside edge or off the trousers. A tough call for the third umpire. No conclusive evidence and the onfield decision stays. KKR have lost their only review. A short delivery that was angled into the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to block it as the ball brushed his trouser and settled into the keeper's gloves\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, that's an inch-perfect yorker, {{BATSMAN}}g-out from between his legs away to short fine leg - Faf is down, gets up and tries to run across, but there's a shy at the striker's end. Would've been out if it had hit...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, review wasted! Shockingly poor review! Iyer didn't do the right thing by agreeing to an emotional {{BOWLER}}. This pinned {{BATSMAN}} on the pad after missing the sweep. Always seemed to pitch outside leg but the leggie somehow convinced his skipper, despite a rejection from Pant. Result is, pitched outside leg and review gone in the drain. Poor, poor stuff\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, googly from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} reads off the surface and plays off the back foot, gets hit on the pad first before the ball touched the bat, but {{BATSMAN}} was well outside the line of off stump, review wasted\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, this is excellent stuff from {{BOWLER}}. Another short ball that is banged into the surface, he slants it across the left hander and {{BATSMAN}} cannot connect with the pull, the ball flies under his bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, loopy ball and slammed down the ground for the man at long-off to drop it. That was a poor drop from Munro coming in from long-off. Warner at the other end is furious as {{BATSMAN}} didn't even stay alert to take a single. The young man is under the pump here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, direct hit and Yuvraj would have had a diamond duck to his name. Very full and on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} misses the flick and is rapped on the pads, the ball rolls to the left of {{BOWLER}} and Yuvraj was backing up for the run. {{BATSMAN}} sends him back and {{BOWLER}} fires a throw which is off-target\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BOWLER}} appeals for LBW. But that ball had clearly pitched outside leg. {{BATSMAN}} winds up for a big mow by clearing his front leg, was beaten for pace as he missed the heave to the leg-side, pinged on the back thigh where there is no protection. He is down on the ground grimacing in pain. Meanwhile, RCB take the review and waste it. Not sure who prompted them to challenge the decision as it had pitched miles outside leg. Nonetheless, the good thing for DD is {{BATSMAN}} is back on his feet and is ready to resume..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, a dipping slower delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} didn't pick it as he misses the flick and overbalances a touch. {{BOWLER}} was confident enough to convince his skipper to go for the review but it was confirmed by UltraEdge that there was a clear inside edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BATSMAN}} has been given OUT LBW and he wants a review. Was the ball tailing enough to miss the leg-stump? It's a fair delivery, think there's no bat on that and I feel it's sliding down - the impact seems to be in front of leg. UltraEdge confirms that there's no bat on that. Hawk-Eye in: Missing and {{BATSMAN}} survives. Low full-toss and the late tail beat {{BATSMAN}}'s attempted whip, struck him low and was going down with the angle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped! It was a return catch and {{BOWLER}} has spilt it. Flighted around off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and closes the bat face to work it into the leg-side, the leading edge pops to the right of the bowler, {{BOWLER}} dives across and gets both hands, but the ball does not stick. He has also hurt his finger in the process..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, angles the ball in, the ball strikes the inside edge and thuds into the pad. The bowler, keeper and almost the entire squad miss the inside edge and take a review. The UltraEdge makes it clear. {{BATSMAN}} survives\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, second dropped catch! This is unbelievable really. Is this {{BATSMAN}}'s night? Went hard at a shortish delivery and miscued it to Jadeja at mid-off. He jumped in order to take it but failed yet again. But you know {{BATSMAN}}, he'll give you more chances\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, huge shout of \"no\" from {{BATSMAN}}, but that came only after he took a couple of steps down which set Rayudu on the charge. Rayudu had made it almost halfway down before having to turn back. Back of a length just outside off, patted to backward point. Rayudu changed direction while running and had the throw hit him, or even with a direct-hit, he was gone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped by Rishabh Pant! {{BATSMAN}} went too far across his off-stump and tried the scoop, he may have played that stroke a touch too early. Spoons it straight to the keeper who was late to pick the ball as the ball swirled around him to distract his attention. Oh, boy!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Delhi have taken a review in the second over of the match itself. They've challenged the umpire's call. Has {{BATSMAN}} edged this? Rishabh Pant was excited but there's clear daylight between the bat and ball. Delhi lose their review! Was a quicker legbreak outside off and the batsman was looking to steer it to third man before he got beaten on his bottom edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BOWLER}} drops an absolute dolly. You can't expect an easier catch than this. And he has no one else to blame. It spins back into {{BATSMAN}} who chips it straight back to {{BOWLER}}. But he wasn't expecting it at all and ends up spilling it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, Tiwary drops {{BATSMAN}}. Oh you can't do that. {{BOWLER}} hits the pitch hard on a back of a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} dangles a horizontal bat and edges it for a simple catch to first slip where Tiwary makes a meal of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, run-out chance missed. {{BATSMAN}} taps the flatter delivery into the on-side and sets off, Pathan is not interested and the big bloke has to turn and run back, Dhoni runs forward, picks the ball and has a shy, misses and {{BATSMAN}} survives\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{BATSMAN}} has been given out LBW, he has a word with his partner and decides to review. {{BOWLER}}'s foot is way behind the line, so no problems with the no-ball. Moving on, looks like no bat as well. Ultra-Edge confirms it. HawkEye in - Pitching - In-line. Impact - In-line. Wickets - missing. Superb review from {{BATSMAN}}. It was full and spearing in, {{BATSMAN}} was shuffling across and misses the clip. Is thudded low on the pad, the on-field call was OUT and {{BATSMAN}} challenged it. Gets the decision in his favour in the end with the ball missing the leg-stump\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, {{TEAM}} review: {{BATSMAN}} has been adjudged lbw and he's decided to challenge the umpire's call. Is there an inside edge? There certainly is a sound. Yup, there's a spike on the UltraEdge and Jonny survives. Was the googly that beat the batsman's flick and struck him on the pads\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, yorker outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} fails to get bat on ball. Ishan Kishan fumbles and CdG looks for a quick bye, comically he loses balance and stumbles to get back. Ishan Kishan misses and the Kiwi gets away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, drama that is what kick-starts match number 30. That looked close. The ball nipped in and struck the pads. Bat first is what the third umpire reckoned and {{BATSMAN}} survives. That was mighty close. That looked dead but the on-field umpire said it not out and rightly so as there seemed to be a faint inside edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, fuller length delivery swerving down leg, {{BATSMAN}} shuffled a bit in a bid to flick it fine but couldn't make any contact. It skims the outer half of the pad en route to the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, dropped by the substitute, Vijay! A wide and full one, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and lashes it square, straight to Vijay at point where Vijay spills a rgulation chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, RR have gone up for a lbw review against {{BATSMAN}}. The pertinent point is whether it has hit the bat first or pad? No bat involved. It hit the pad first, but the ball straightened enough to miss the off pole. It was a flighted delivery, {{BATSMAN}} was prodding forward to tap, but the ball gripped off the pitch to clip him high on the front pad\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, that was smacked hard by {{BATSMAN}}. Middled his shot but hit the stumps at the bowler's end. Billings wanted the run but {{BOWLER}} was quick to gather the ball and uproot the stumps with the ball in his hand. Billings was out of the crease for while but makes sure to get back in time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, another yes-no and {{BATSMAN}} escapes. A direct-hit would have seen him walk back. He wanted to drive this short of length delivery through cover, got an inside edge to Amla at mid-wicket, AB shouts and sends him back, the throw was wide of the stumps\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, oh nearly.. A communication breakdown between both the batsmen almost resulted in a run-out. A short of length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slashed it straight to point, Kulkarni set off for a single, DK was ball-watching and sends him back. Yuvi, the fielder, was slow to react and fires a throw at the non-strikers end, misses the target and Kulkarni survives\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, smashed hard .. and flush into {{BOWLER}}'s collar bone. {{BATSMAN}} holds nothing back here, forehards a slap down the ground, where {{BOWLER}} tries his desperate best to get his hands in the way, or even save his face. Is hammered into his chest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, now Prithvi. Oh these catches keep going down -- the simplest of them. {{BATSMAN}} is foxed by the wrong 'un, again, as he goes deep in the crease to some-sort-cut. Chipped up, straight to extra cover in the ring. Shaw gets both hands, perhaps closing them a little too early. Debut nerves\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, fullish just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} sits low outside off looking to scoop it over short fine leg. Loses his balance and it flies off the pad to short third man. DK calls for it and grabs. Appeals and the finger went up. {{BATSMAN}} knew he didn't hit it, so got it overturned\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run, hit straight back at {{BOWLER}} who puts it down. Half a chance here. {{BATSMAN}} had timed that beautifully and the ball was travelling. But it came at a nice height in the followthrough. {{BOWLER}} parries it towards mid-off\n"
