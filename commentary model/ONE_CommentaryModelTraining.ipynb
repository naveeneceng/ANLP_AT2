            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, run-out chance and Kishan hits the stump mic instead of the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} was a goner. {{BOWLER}} nails the wide yorker, {{BATSMAN}} digs it to point and sets off for the single, no response from Rohit and he had to turn back, well short with a direct hit. No one backing up and the duo eventually get the single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Buttler went backwards at {{BATSMAN}}ep-midwicket, then circled un{{BATSMAN}}r it and drops it in the end. That was a mistimed slog-sweep and the ball stayed in the sky for a long long time. Buttler messed it up by never really judging it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, shuffles well across. Almost a set of stumps away and flicks it away to short fine. Again, a shy at the stumps at the non-striker's end..a direct hit would have meant curtains\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 132kph, {{BATSMAN}} dances down the ground and batters it to the right of extra cover. It travelled quickly to Gowtham and he failed to hold onto it. Would be very harsh to call it a drop\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Archer drops his second catch of the match! de Kock scored 65, how much will {{BATSMAN}} score? He had slogged the length delivery to deep mid-wicket where Jofra puts down a sitter. Not a great day for him in the outfield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fired in on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} drives and gets a single to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a direct hit and {{BATSMAN}} was gone. The idea of a quick single, after tapping this slower ball in front of cover, is well and good. But {{BATSMAN}} is no spring chicken. Would've been a few inches short as the fielder swooped and spun around for the throw\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fires this short outside off, it spins back in slightly and {{BATSMAN}} mistimes the cut wide of cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Tripathi had given up there. But backward point has just one stump to aim at and Vijay Shankar, who is on as a substitute, misses. Even wider than the previous ball and {{BATSMAN}} has to really reach out for the cut. He mistimes it to the left of the fielder who turns around quickly after collecting and fires it in. Not great judgement from these two batsmen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, tossed up ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} drives to deep extra cover to bring up his third IPL fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. {{TEAM}} needed someone to take over the baton after Raina's wicket and the Kent batsman has taken the onus on himself to keep the chase going. Raises the bat and gets the applause from the yellow faithfuls. Walked across his stumps and {{BOWLER}} fired it in the blockhole, the sweep comes off the under edge and bobbles away to fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a sort of a miscued punch, wide of extra cover, but nothing's miscued in this fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BATSMAN}}'s turn. More cheers from the crowd. This is a celebration going on, not a run chase. Clipped off the pads backward of square. For all their brutality otherwise, they've brought up fifties with innocent singles\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, pushes this one hastily off the backfoot to mid-on for a quick single as {{BOWLER}} himself has to chase after it to prevent the single - but he doesn't manage to\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, inches short of a yorker and he's squeezed it out to backward point. {{BATSMAN}}'s 15th IPL fifty - and his first this season\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, once more keeps it on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} nudges it square on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, is that a dropped catch? It looks like it. Another very full ball, {{BATSMAN}} crashes it to the right of cover where Zaheer goes across low with both hands but fails to hold on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, the partnership between {{BATSMAN}} and Manish Pandey is now 50. Lowish full toss on the pads. The best that {{BATSMAN}} can do is whip it away to deep mid for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, pushes a single down to long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, quicker on middle and leg, tucked away into the leg-side and that'll be 43rd IPL fifty for David {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50-run stand up as {{BATSMAN}} nudges the shortish delivery through mid-wicket for one. Need to up the ante now that both the batsmen have got their eye in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, kamikaze running from Punjab. {{BATSMAN}} would've been dismissed for a blob had SKY effected a run-out at the bowler's end. Chopped towards cover, they risk a single and {{BATSMAN}} would've been short by a few inches there, despite him dragging his bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, and Kaul has dropped it. Lost it in the lights may be or might have been the swirling ball coming down. Eventful first over. {{BATSMAN}} danced out, looked to loft, got a big fat outer-edge and the man at deep third dropped it. The fielder did not even get a hand to it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, wide of off again from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} scythes it in front of square on the off-side. The single brings up the 50-run stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, 1 run, looks for the deft upper cut and misses. The ball lands on a couple of bounces to the keeper, who fumbles to allow the single. The man at short third man mopped it up and had a shy at the bowler's end. Had there been a direct hit, it would have been another casualty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He shows the sticker on his bat that says - Universe Boss. Job not done as Punjab need to bat deep and take them to a competitive total. Wrong 'un around leg-stump and {{BATSMAN}} sweeps it to deep backward square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50-partnership comes up! {{BATSMAN}} steers it wide of short third for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} is hopping back in the crease as he defends it to the left of short mid-wicket, so he really has to put the skates on as he bolts towards the non-striker's end. McClenaghan throws himself forward as he releases the ball in one motion along with the dive, but {{BATSMAN}} gets there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, biffed to mid-off and that'll be Steven {{BATSMAN}}'s 8th IPL fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, chance and dropped, Rohit is wriggling in pain, but he gets up and it seems to be all OK. Coming to the ball, it was a high full-toss that was sliced to the left of backward point. Rohit tumbled across and think the ball hit him high on the arm\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, pokes the ball into the off-side to bring up the 50-run opening stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, {{BATSMAN}} survives easily in the end. Looked closer to the naked eye but when KXIP reviewed it, Hawk Eye showed it to be missing leg stump comfortably. Fuller ball that angled into {{BATSMAN}}, he was on the shuffle and missed the flick. Looked really close initially, not to be\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50-run stand up between the openers as {{BATSMAN}} tucks this one through mid-wicket off an inside edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Raises his bat and acknowledges the applause from the home crowd. Still a long way to go for him. The pitch has started to get slower and run making is not going to be easy. With him being set, DD would want him to carry on. Coming to the ball: Plays the slower delivery with soft hands into the off-side ring and jogs across to the other end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, skipper leading from the front, brings up his 12th fifty in IPL. Gets a standing ovation from his team mates in the dug-out. Has been a responsible knock by the lad. Hooks the short ball to deep mid-wicket and gets to the milestone. Gets there and raises his bat to acknowledge the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a direct hit from Rohit and Vijay would have been running all the way to the dug-out - a suicidal call from {{BATSMAN}}, came down the track and pushed it straight to cover, bounced nicely into Rohit's hands and he had time to to take aim and hit the stumps\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Shaw may have been struggling here. Have to confirm with the replay. But Morgan's under-arm flick running in from cover misses the mark. Would've been touch and go. It was Shaw's call anyway, so he had no one else to blame. {{BATSMAN}} was less sure after tapping this back of a length delivery into the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Manish Pandey is on fire in the field tonight, as he almost pulls off yet another stunner. Leaps up in the air near the boundary, takes the catch and parries it away as he's about to hit the ground. {{BATSMAN}} walked down the track and lofted that to long-on where Pandey plucked it, parried it and tried to take it on the second attempt with a desperate dive, but hard luck. Could have been six on any other day.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50-run stand up for the fourth wicket. How pivotal has this knock by the youngster been. Short of a length outside off and {{BATSMAN}} does well to slap it to cover, a slight misfield too but the batsmen are satisfied with the single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, 1 run, so many things happening on one ball. Lets first acknowledge {{BATSMAN}}'s fifty. A fine knock on a surface where the rest have struggled. And whatsmore it is his fastest IPL fifty. Now to the rest of the ball: {{BOWLER}} oversteps to deliver the slower ball, dabbed to short third and {{BATSMAN}} wanted a single, Stoinis sends him back and he makes it just in time as there was a direct hit, the deflection forces Stoinis to go for the run and they steal it in the end quite comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, hammered to long-on. 150 stand up. It's as if their earlier troubles didn't even exist\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, sharp bumper on the face, {{BATSMAN}} was surprised by how quickly it came to him. He mistimes the pull totally and ends up hitting it just to the left of the side wicket. {{BOWLER}} charges quickly towards but fails to pick up the ball cleanly. And he is gutted with himself\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Faf follows Watson in raising his fifty. Opens the face as he pushes a full ball to third man. Continues his good form in this tournament\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, use of the feet to drive this firmly down the ground to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, advances and compiles a well-deserved fifty with a ease to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. It is his fourth this season. Waves the bat around, walks towards his skipper and shakes hands. Got it in 26 balls against RPS, today has taken two balls less. Back of a length and on the hips, tucked square on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another excellent yorker, it's been a top over from {{BOWLER}} thus far. {{BATSMAN}} squeezes it out towards point to get to his 8th IPL fifty! Is this the breakthrough season he wanted? Has definitely started that way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another out-swinger on a good length, punched down to long-off. Brings up the fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He has to finish this off for his team, lest the follow the route they took against Mumbai\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, just about carries to Bhuvneshwar but he cannot hold on. Pops out of his fingertips. A low full toss which is very wide of off and {{BATSMAN}} squirts it right off the toe-end as he reaches out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, back of a length delivery on the hips, dropped off the back foot to square leg where Williamson picks up and throws at the non-striker's end. He wasn't even in the frame when the ball crossed the stumps. Terrible running from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, pushed it through and more importantly cramped {{BATSMAN}} for room, knocked to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a sitter .. and dropped. Yusuf Pathan of all people. {{BATSMAN}}'s done in in his desperate attempt to make room and hoick one downtown. Has absolutely no control, and Pathan has all the time in the world to settle under at long-on, wait, and then let the ball slip through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, flat and shortish ball, {{BATSMAN}} stays deep in his crease and pulls it powerfully. He would have thought that a boundary was there for the taking. But, there was Chahar at square leg, who flew full length to his left and could only get a hand on it. It will be too harsh to call that as a drop, he got both hands though, perhaps had a chance to cling on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Flawless innings from the {{TEAM}} skipper. Bided his time initially and just stepping the ante now. Nudges it towards mid-wicket, puts on the skates and comes back for the second fuss-free\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. 29th in IPL. Not one of his best. Quicker delivery on the stumps, clocked at 113kph, that's the pace of Bhatia. {{BATSMAN}} is hurried into the flick and sends it along the ground to deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a direct hit at the bowler's end and {{BATSMAN}} was struggling. He was coming back for the second run, Dhawan didn't respond one bit. Aravind was the man with the throw and he sent it to the keeper. Kedar Jadhav still had time to effect the run-out, but his shy is way off-target. {{BATSMAN}} scrambles home with a dive. Coming to the ball, it was flat and wide of off, punched to the left of long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped down the leg-si{{BATSMAN}}. Second drop of the innings. This might turn out to be costly for KXIP. Short ball, down leg, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the pull and gets a glove. The ball flies fine and Rahul got both hands to it diving to his right but spilled it. The two batters steal a single as well. And to make matters worse, a bout of cramps seem to have engulfed Rahul. He seems to be in some agonising pain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, tummy-lined, around off, dabbed down to third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, has {{BOWLER}} damaged his finger there? This was a rocket throw by Smith from mid-off and the bowler seems to be in some pain. But it's his left hand, so no problem. Was a full ball that was drilled by {{BATSMAN}} and he has managed to get a quick single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Kaul spills a dolly! He had enough time to judge this but rushed into the catch and eventually, it slipped and crashed into his neck before falling to the ground. Was a quickish delivery and {{BATSMAN}} mistimed the pull due to the bounce. Kaul from deep backward square leg anticipated it well and got to it nicely as well, just couldn't complete the job. {{BATSMAN}} lucky in the end. How much will this cost SRH?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, the time-out almost brings a wicket with it. Smashed down, doesn't bother keeping it down and pops in and out the man at long-off lined up. Ah the dew. And the drop. Mohit Sharma the man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by Bairstow! It was a meaty outside edge from {{BATSMAN}}, who was looking to swing through the line of this full ball. Bairstow dives to his right, goes with one hand, but it doesn't stick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, very full and on the stumps, works it to long-on. And he will bring up his fifty too, he is palying the role of anchor to perfection here, needs to carry on for his team\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 102kph, {{BATSMAN}} knocks it down to long-on to bring up yet another fifty this season. What a time he's having\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, chance and dropped, RCB simply can't afford this, Kohli looks livid, but Chahal is the man who has dropped it. This was tossed up well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went for his flamboyant inside out drive, didn't bother to keep it down. Chahal did all the hard yards, ran across to his right from sweeper cover, got to the ball and then shelled it as he tumbled onto the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Narine has shelled a sitter at third man. Oh dear. {{BOWLER}} just turns around in despair. A short of length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} tries to pull off the front foot and sends a top-edge flying down to third man. They don't come easier than that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower ball well wide outside off, steered through backward point for a single. 10th IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}, almost unnoticed due to the Pant mayhem. It's the fourth for the DD skipper this season and all of them have come in the last five games. Some form!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Bhuvi, the culprit. {{BATSMAN}}, trying to be too cheeky, almost gifted his wicket. Moves across a long way and attempted the scoop shot. Got decent amount of wood, but there wasn't enough elevation there. It went at catchable height to Bhuvi at short fine. He makes a mess of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, tucks the length delivery to square leg and calls for a risky single. Had this been a direct hit at the striker's end, Bhajji was gone. Miller was the fielder and he could have taken some more time before having a go\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50 partnership! Gets there with a flick off the pads to short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, biffed away to long-off and that brings the 50-run stand between the duo\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, full and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and drills it hard towards mid-on. 50-up for Punjab in no time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, bodyline, swatted round the corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, tossed up well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends down low and sweeps it towards deep mid-wicket for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, full on off, {{BATSMAN}} looks to flick and the leading edge dribbles to backward point. 50 for {{BATSMAN}} and it's his first one in {{TEAM}} colors\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Kohli has put one down in the deep. Low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} crouches low to whip it over the rope, he doesn't get enough to clear the long boundary in Dubai, Kohli moves to his right and might have just overran a bit. He tries to adjust and take it over his head, but the ball just doesn't stick. How costly will it be?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fullish just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drives it to mid-off and takes the single. Fifty for {{BATSMAN}}, his 37th half-century in the IPL and he gets a rousing reception from the Kolkata crowd. The {{TEAM}} dug-out stands and applauds, {{BATSMAN}} waves his bat around to soak it all in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, tossed up outside off, driven down towards long-off for a single, brings up another IPL fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, flatter and around off, {{BATSMAN}} moves back and across to work it towards mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, squeezed away to the right of point, Ishan does superbly out there, diving, keeping it to onlly a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, very full and outside off, drilled down the ground to long-off, 36th IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! What a way to start the season! He's looked ominous right from the word go today\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by Ishan Kishan! Back of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} is squared up while moving around in the crease, gets a healthy outside edge. Would've been a sharp catch. Kishan dives full stretched to his right but puts it down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for VK, but he won't celebrate. Doesn't even raise the bat. Just nudges this length ball into the on-side and gets to the milestone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, very full and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} knocks it down to long-off. And he will reach his maiden IPL fifty with it. He is finally coming off age\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another full toss that {{BATSMAN}} can't take full toll of, slams it straight down the ground but long-on gets across swiftly to keep the batsmen to just a single. 100-run stand is up!! These two just enjoy batting together, don't they?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, the off-break. A room creating punch down to long-off. Brings up the 50-run between the duo\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, juicy full toss outside off at 136ks, {{BATSMAN}} looks to go hard but ends up slicing the drive off the outer half towards deep point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, stabs the ball out with soft hands into the off-side and gets a single. Fifty of the partnership comes up as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, in the air and Rashid grasses it. Instantly puts his hand up and apologises. Another cutter, thrown outside off. {{BATSMAN}} flashes his bat and spanks it towards sweeper cover. Rashid runs across, covers good ground in getting towards the ball but unfortunately can't hold onto it as he slides. {{BOWLER}} is not happy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, generously tossed up on off, overpitches, and {{BATSMAN}} drills it down to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, oh he's missed a big hit here. Full and outside off stump, better of going over cover but knowing {{BATSMAN}}, he believes in muscling the ball rather than lofting over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a direct hit and even {{BATSMAN}}'s dive wouldn't have saved him - drilled the drive straight to extra-cover and set-off for a quick single - Shreyas Iyer was helped by some good bounce and has a shy at the bowler's end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, brings up the 50-run stand with a clip off his pads to deep square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct-hit would have been curtains for {{BATSMAN}}! Short of a length, {{BATSMAN}} cross-bats it to extra cover and he gave up as he was sprinting towards the other end. Chawla missed the target at the bowler's end and {{BATSMAN}} survives\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Short ball angled around the ribcage, {{BATSMAN}} was cramped for room and despite that he decided to go for the pull, sends it off the thick top-edge and Varun Aaron can't hold on at short fine. He dived to his left but couldn't gather the ball cleanly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, maiden IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}, pushed through outside off, {{BATSMAN}} hangs back and works it wide of cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, hundred for {{BATSMAN}}. Two in two days in this IPL. Gayle yesterday and {{BATSMAN}} today. The helmet comes off and the bat is up in the air to acknowledge the applause of the traveling fans. There was also a little fist pump as soon as he placed it in the gap. He scored a hundred for Royals while playing against {{TEAM}} and now he's done the vice versa - the first player to do that. Coming to the ball: Back of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} knocks it wide of point and reaches the milestone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50 for {{BATSMAN}} now. Cracked through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Samson the man who puts it down. {{BATSMAN}} tried to repeat the previous shot, but does not get the elevation on the cut shot, Samson jumps up at backward point and parries it over him. Should have done a better job there. RR have not had a good day in the field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Stokes misses a direct hit here. Certain run out opportunity. Firstly, {{BATSMAN}} is duped by a slower ball. Pops it up towards short point, where Stokes comes sprinting in and attacks the ball. Picks the right end too, with {{BATSMAN}} having given up, but misses\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Rabada apologises. Half tracker and {{BATSMAN}} could have hit it anywhere, instead he swivels and pulls it to deep backward square, Rabada misjudged it badly and tracked back before running in, dived forward and got his hands to it. But the ball did not stick. That would have been an impressive end to {{BOWLER}}'s spell\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, run-out missed. {{BATSMAN}} was a goner. Backs away to leg and is made to reach out to his slower short of length delivery, chops the cut towards cover and sets off, Rahane had one stump to aim and he misses. {{BATSMAN}} was gone by a fair distance there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Bumrah is the culprit. Slower length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slices it high into the air and it kept swirling backwards behind the keeper, Bumrah runs back from short third but can't cling onto it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}, his second of the tournament, change of pace from {{BOWLER}}, slower ball outside off, dabbed down towards third man for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Jason Roy has put down a dolly. The pacy short ball catches {{BATSMAN}} by surprise. He still persists with his pull shot and gets it off the top part of the willow. The ball balloons up on the leg-side. Roy, at mid-wicket, runs back, settles under it and makes a mess of it. {{BOWLER}} can't believe it. He has to wait for his first IPL wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! How costly will that be? {{BOWLER}} has no one else to blame than himself. The slower short ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} tries to flat-bat it down town but the top-edge flies straight up to the right of the bowler, {{BOWLER}} sets himself up and lets it slip through his hands. He took his eyes off just at the right time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 29th IPL fifty for AB {{BATSMAN}}! Punches a length ball square of sweeper cover and gets to the landmark with an air of nonchalance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, oh dear! Would you believe it! Trent Boult has denied Amit {{BOWLER}} his fourth hat-trick in the IPL. And he would be absolutely gutted. It was a well flighted wrong 'un, {{BATSMAN}} bends down low and goes for an almighty heave. It comes off the top half of the bat and was in the air for a long time. Two men called for it, one was Boult and the other was Rutherford. Perhaps that put the former off, he misjudged it completely and then had to jump back to complete the catch - can't grab hold of the ball and {{BOWLER}} has his hands on his head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by Parthiv! That could possibly have been the second wicket of the innings, but {{BOWLER}} has his hands on his head. The keeper has let him down. {{BATSMAN}} went for a drive away from his body as an outside edge flies straight to the keeper. Parthiv dives to his right, gets his glove to it but fails to cling on to the catch. Quite an eventful over that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for Hash. The century stand is raised as well. Flighted delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} mistimes the lofted on-drive to long-on. This has been a fine innings from the South African batsman. It's been a good mix of aggressive hits with gentle nudges\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}, his 8th in IPL, the leg-break from {{BOWLER}}, but the length was short, allowed {{BATSMAN}} to go back and cut it towards backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, drills the full toss back at {{BOWLER}} who got both hands at it, but it was hit really hard and just burst through. Half a chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, very full and outside off, drilled down the ground to long-off, 36th IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! What a way to start the season! He's looked ominous right from the word go today\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by Bishnoi at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} had completely mistimed the pull shot, but the fielder running in couldn't latch onto the catch. Was a good effort to get there with a sprint, just that the end result wasn't in the fielder's favour. Was a short ball that induced a top-edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty of the combo comes up! That was on the pads and clipped away uppishly for the man at {{BOWLER}}ep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Applause from his team mates in the dugout. It is his 17th IPL fifty and first as skipper. Pooran walks up to congratulate his skipper. Flatter delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} works it to deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another 50-run stand up between these two. This was a short delivery and {{BATSMAN}} pulled it down to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Maiden IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}, first of many to come? Low full-toss on the pads and it's clipped past square leg for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, oh Aravind. You really do not grant a life. Certainly not to this guy. Another compulsive pull here from {{BATSMAN}} but with the ball gaining in height, only manages the top-edge. Right into the hands of fine leg, who slides and makes an absolute mess\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fires this carrom ball on a back of length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} pats it wide of cover. He was struggling on the single there, would have been gone with a direct-hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another fine fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! Has been consistent right throughout. This was a short and low delivery on middle, he flicked that away to deep mid-wicket for a single to reach the milestone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! No, {{TEAM}} don't want to bat sensibly. {{BATSMAN}} decides to go after this flighted delivery outside off from {{BOWLER}} with an inside-out loft. Doesn't middle and hits it straight to sweeper cover, where Umesh decides to be generous and puts down a dolly! Oh, RCB!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, delivers this by coming in between the umpire, {{BATSMAN}} nudges it to mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by Mujeeb at deep mid-wicket. {{BOWLER}} actually did well by spinning it into {{BATSMAN}} but {{BATSMAN}}'s in that mood. Carved across the line, only to be let off. That's the long side of the boundary and that should have been taken\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 2 runs, a direct hit and {{BATSMAN}} would have been a goner. Very full pacy delivery down leg, {{BATSMAN}} misses the flick, strikes his pad and runs towards fine leg. The throw is decent at the striker's end, but there is no one near the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} gets a couple. Raina is animated as he wanted the bowler to be at the stumps. Had {{BOWLER}} been there, would've had the chance to run {{BATSMAN}} out. {{BOWLER}} was just standing and watching - poor!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BOWLER}} botches a run-out opportunity! He just had to collect the ball cleanly. {{BATSMAN}} was well short. {{BATSMAN}} couldn't find any elevation as he tried to flat-bat the back of length delivery and he hit it straight to mid-off. Never a run there, but the non-striker had come a long way down so {{BATSMAN}} obliged. Would have been gone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fired in fuller, {{BATSMAN}} prods it away into the point region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, back of a length, on off. Swatted off the front foot, to a sliding long-on who's Pandya, Hardik Pandya\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a proper miscue.. who wants it? Actually nobody as it falls safely at long-on. Was through the shot early, skews it up after losing his balance.. {{BATSMAN}} gets away. Lady luck shining brightly on him so far\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! That's a dolly and Munro has spilled it. Short ball and {{BATSMAN}} pulled it aerially to deep mid-wicket. Didn't connect that well but got lucky in the end. Munro probably didn't pace himself well there but no excuses really. How much will this cost DD?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Short of a length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} carved it towards sweeper cover, there was never a second run but considering it was the final ball, he just put his head down and raced back for the second. Clean pick and throw from Pooran to the keeper, {{BATSMAN}} is run-out by a countrymile. Okay, so, it's a no-ball. One more ball left, officially. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Pooran/Rahul) 53(21) [4s-7 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 149.6kph! Very full ball, {{BATSMAN}} jams it out towards mid-off and sets off for a tight single. Iyer misses the target at the bowler's end. A direct hit would have been curtains for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 10,000 runs in T20 cricket for {{BATSMAN}}! Full, pacy delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his horizontal blade at it and the ball runs down to third man off the outside part of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, they are running for everything. The back of the hand delivery and {{BATSMAN}} is early into the drive, the inside edge rolls to the right of Karthik, he shies and misses. Choudhary survives\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another catch put down and it's Fizz again. You don't deserve to win if you are going to field like that. That stare from Rohit Sharma tells it all. Silence all around the Wankhede. Good length delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and slices it, went to the right of short third man, easy catch and he spills it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50-run stand up between the openers as {{BATSMAN}} glides the short of a length delivery down to third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slow, just outside off, and angling away. A quiet, neat run down to third man -- and fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, knocked out to mid-on, where {{BOWLER}} is quick to run across, swoop low, gather and then fire it back at the non-striker's as well. A direct hit would've ruined all of {{BATSMAN}}'s hard work\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, back of a length on off, {{BATSMAN}} punches it to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, the partnership between {{BATSMAN}} and Krunal Pandya is now 50!! Short ball, pulled away and the ball lands on the bounce to be picked up by Rahane at deep mid\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another chance and Shardul has put down a sitter - butter fingers all of a sudden from CSK, on a good length and angling across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to go inside out over cover - the bat-face turned on impact and he carved it over point - Shardul had plenty of time on the ball and somehow makes a mess of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by Uthappa! Definitely two noises there. Back of length, cutting in and takes the inside edge. The ball deflects off {{BATSMAN}}'s thigh as well. Uthappa dives to his left with one hand but the ball hits him hard on the glove\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, in the air and lands safely. Slower ball banged into the surface, {{BATSMAN}} goes for his favorite pull but was a bit early into the shot, the ball hits him high on the bat and balloons towards square leg, no one there to take the catch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, that could have been a sensational catch, but Samson cannot cling on! {{BOWLER}} begins with a half-tracker which should have been deposited in the stands, but {{BATSMAN}} doesn't go through with the pull. He checks his shot, might have stopped on him. It travels low and quick in front of Samson at deep mid-wicket. He runs in full throttle, dives forward nearly plucks it off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slid in from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} jabs it to the right of long-on and brings up his half-century. Mumbai will hope that this knock gets his season going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty off 19 balls. {{BATSMAN}} has turned it around for the Royals. Just a bat raise and is congratulated by his skipper. Quicker delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} cracks it to sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, length ball outside off, slapped to deep point. It's the fourth 100-run stand that these two have put up this season. Incredible!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by Kulkarni at third man! Short one just outside off, angling in, {{BATSMAN}} stays low and gets under it, runs his hands through the upper-cut, Dhawal runs from third man in to take the catch but fluffs it - concedes a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, chance, but it was gone even before {{BOWLER}} could get his hands around, Dropped short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stayed back and punched it to the right of the bowler, burst through his hands even before he could react\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, chance and Mujeeb has dropped a dolly, short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} backed away and dabbed it in the air towards short third man. Mujeeb didn't spot it early, the ball was dying in front of him, he bends down low and can't hold on. He then has a shy at the striker's end as the batsmen sneak in a single and misses, but Shubman Gill was always in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, hammered back at the bowler and that's not really a chance. Props to {{BOWLER}} for getting his hands in position quick enough and attempt a catch but he can't hold on. It was hit powerfully. Saved a boundary really\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50-run stand up with that single as {{BATSMAN}} drags it away to deep mid-wicket, the crowd thought it was in the gap, but it wasn't\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, quicker and on leg, turned to deep backward square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower short ball, the ball climbs onto the batsman. {{BATSMAN}} gets a top-edge and the man running in from the short fine leg region - Sundar drops it. The ball popped out as his elbows thudded onto the ground. Another dropped chance, another charmed life\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, goes wide of the crease and angles one on the pads, clipped away sweetly to deep square leg. 50-up for Punjab\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He holds the key to this run chase for both sides. The longer he stays the better for Rajasthan, but not for Mumbai. Fuller and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} is happy to push it down to long-off and take the single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, nurdled away through square leg and that brings up {{BATSMAN}}' fifty. He's found form of late and this is a massive boost for {{TEAM}}. Raise of the bat to soak in all the applauses from the {{BATSMAN}}g-out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, it slams the pad. Buttler seems to be jumping up in appeal. {{BOWLER}} is busy trying to clean up the possible leg bye. Oh Rajasthan have to take it up. It's all up to the angle .. how big is it getting? Okay so DK has missed the glance, he's stuck in front of middle. And yes, HawkEye shows it clipping the edge of the bail. Everyone's happy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50-run stand up with that single! Short of a length on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} nudges it away to short mid and scurries across to the other end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, 1 run, looks for the deft upper cut and misses. The ball lands on a couple of bounces to the keeper, who fumbles to allow the single. The man at short third man mopped it up and had a shy at the bowler's end. Had there been a direct hit, it would have been another casualty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, flatter and outside off, chops the cut towards cover and takes Yuvraj on for the single. The shy at the bowler's end misses but I reckon {{BATSMAN}} may have made it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. First of the season and first in a long time. His last fifty also came against Chennai last year. He is set now and got the milestone out of the way, needs to launch to get Mumbai to a good total. He eases it wide of cover and calls for the single, there was a bit of confusion but they get it easily in the end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50 run stand. {{BOWLER}} adjusts, bowling this arm-ball slow and full. To long-on for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, and that's fifty for {{TEAM}}'s skipper {{BATSMAN}}. His 10th IPL fifty. Continuing from where he left off from the last game. Eases a single to long-off and reaches the milestone, raises his bat to soak in the applause from the dug-out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, chance and Gill has dropped it, would have been a fine catch - he did well to get to the ball, had to go one handed, parried it in the air and then couldn't get across on the rebound - would have been a screamer had he held on. Coming to the ball, {{BATSMAN}} backed away to a well flighted delivery and drilled it inside out - wide of cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, tight single. {{BATSMAN}} moves across to flick it into the on-side, the leading edge flies towards backward point and Rohit calls for the quick single, he would have been short with a direct hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, the slower loopy full-toss from Sran, would have been called as a wide had he let it go, went chasing and chips it wide of cover-point, raises a 27-ball half-century\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50 for {{BATSMAN}}. Second one in the IPL. Pune need him tonight. Pulls a short ball to deep mid-wicket to get to the milestone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slants it away outside off, slapped away to sweeper cover and 50-run stand between these two\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, short of length and {{BATSMAN}} hops to tuck it backward of square. The 50-run stand comes up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. First of the season for the skipper. Just a quick bat raise towards his team and on his goes.. Wrong 'un and on the shorter length, tucked away in front of square on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, driven off the back foot wide of Smith at extra cover. Good effort there with the dive, but can only make a half-stop, not enough to stop {{BATSMAN}} from getting to his fifty. He's gone a few notches higher in these last few games\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, it's dropped this time. Gee, this is a crazy over. Two wickets, one just escaped the fielder and then one was put down. This time {{BOWLER}} does what most fast bowlers with pace do to {{BATSMAN}}. Bowl that bouncer and have him jumping around in the crease. It was down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} could back away or duck, tried to pull, the ball went off the back of the bat, a lob it was to first slip. Easiest of chances, but Shreyas Iyer spills it. {{BOWLER}} is very disappointed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} cuts it firmly to point but a diving effort by Tripathi saves a certain boundary. In fact it was a chance, Tripathi got his hand to it but couldn't take it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, miscued front-footed pull. Straight to long-on. Also, the 50-stand between these two\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, anti-climax. Nabi puts down a tough chance at long-off. {{BATSMAN}} miscues the pull and Nabi comes charging in from long-off, bends forward and gets both hands but fails to hold onto it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, edged and dropped! Rahul Tripathi the culprit on that occasion. Puts down a sitter. Was a full length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for a drive and the away swing induces an outside edge. However, Tripathi - the lone slipper makes a mess out of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower ball and well wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} tries the slog and mistimes it towards long-on, 6th IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He is in serious form here. This is his fastest IPL fifty as well, getting it off 23 balls and going past the 25-ball fifty vs GL, Rajkot, 2016\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, oh Watto, you four-lifed cat. {{BOWLER}} lines him up perfectly with a sharp nippy bouncer, {{BATSMAN}} pulls, gets hurried up big time, gets a top-edge and Rahul Chahar - running in from deep backward square leg wouldn't have had it easier. But alas, it's the finals, he slides, lets it pop out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! How many dropped catches tonight? And second drop for the skipper. The length ball was delivered for the batsman to send it to the moon. But the batsman lifted it up without any distance for the man at long-off to come in but he dropped it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, opens the bat face and glides it down to third man for one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, flicks to square leg and rushes for a non-existent single. Dhawan aims at the bowler's end and misses, had that hit {{BATSMAN}} was a goner. He is living dangerously here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, he's not hit this well. He grunts \"Aaaargh\" as soon as he hit that in the air and Hetymer has put down a sitter. What has he done? This was the short delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} just chipped it high over cover-point, Hetty ran in and probably overran, came around chest height and he couldn't control. This is a massive let off!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, that was a comedy of errors? The yorkerish delivery was missed by the batsman and was hit on the boot. It was going down leg and the bowler kept on appealing. Number 10 and Jack decided to steal a single and they did. The keeper could not manage to throw the sticks down at the bowler's end, else it could have been tight\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, closer towards off, with {{BATSMAN}} clearing out his front leg to and slogging away straight to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, here's the half-ton. Kotla acknowledges. A leaning drive off an opened bat face through sweeper gets him there. The fourth of the season\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, oh, almost had two in two here. {{BOWLER}} drops a tough chance. Fuller ball at 145.1kph just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} smacked it straight back at him, {{BOWLER}} got both hands but it slipped out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another slower one on a length, worked away for a single (well, inside edge to be honest) to bring up the fifty-run stand in the powerplay. That's one box check. Platform laid for a good score.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, short of a good length and on {{BATSMAN}}'s hips, he was looking to nudge and missed, rolled away off his pads towards square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 146.2kph, {{BOWLER}} tries to bowl a yorker and ends up bowling a low full toss. {{BATSMAN}} push-drives down the pitch and the mid-off fielder dives to his left to stop it. The single also brings up {{BATSMAN}}'s fifty! Can he take his team over the winning line. Just 6 runs came off the over - {{TEAM}} were happy to take the singles against {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, put down. Maxwell of all people. {{BATSMAN}} decides to go onto his back foot, slaps, uppishly without control and extra-cover couldn't have been found any better. Maxwell's surprised too, and the surprise means there's nobody backing up his throw as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, that was a wide ball but {{BATSMAN}} chose to have a swing at it, mistimed with one hand to long-off and that's fifty for the captain. No celebrations but he gets a big applause from everyone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, keeps up with his leg-liners. This time darting it a lot fuller. Flicked away in front of square. Okay, this is his half-ton. ctrl C + ctrl V the description from a few balls earlier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit and McCullum would have been on his bike. {{BATSMAN}} punched this towards extra cover, where Suchith got a good bounce and it was to his strong hand as well. Fires a throw at the striker's end and fails to hit the stumps. McCullum was stretching and would have been touch and go\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 2nd IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! First innings as an opener and he's grabbed the opportunity. This kid is class apart and it's only a matter of time before he proves that. Good knock so far and will want to bat deep. Reaches the landmark with a slice down to third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, just short of the long-on fielder and {{BATSMAN}} reaches his fifty! Pitched up delivery, {{BATSMAN}} lofted it over mid-on and falls in front of the diving long-on fielder. {{BATSMAN}} collects a single to get to his milestone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He points at his badge to the dugout. Delhi need him to kick on and convert it into a big one. Waits for the ball to turn and nudges it past mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Naman Ojha, with the gloves on, puts one down. The ball went high up and was swirling awkwardly all the way through. But at this level, it should be taken. {{BATSMAN}} was completely duped by the slower leg-cutter. Such good bowling from Bhuvi to keep it wide of off and out of reach\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit would have made things interesting. Pitched up delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} pushes to mid-off and sets off. He puts in a dive. But had Jayant Yadav found the target, {{BATSMAN}} would have been a goner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, had {{BOWLER}} hit the target, Goswami might have been struggling. {{BATSMAN}} set off for a quick single after nudging the ball towards short mid-wicket. {{BOWLER}} was quick on his follow-through, ran across Goswami, got to the ball and then fired a throw at the striker's end, he missed with Goswami way short of his crease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, huge mix-up and this has to be in list of all-time best moments of IPL. So, before I could miss important details, here's what happened. This was dabbed to point and Watto nearly ran in towards Faf who was struck midway having taken a couple of strides forward. Axar Patel then threw the ball to the bowling end where Munro collects and instead of throwing down stumps at his end he chose to fire a wayward throw at the batting end, Pant dives and misses and in the end they sneak in a run. For good part of this chaos, both batsmen were struck in the middle of the pitch and DC had way too many options which eventually led to a disaster\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, appeal for LBW - {{BOWLER}} liked it and Shreyas points towards the review. Only the height is a matter of concern, looked pretty adjacent to the stumps. It's a fair delivery and there's no bat on that, UltraEdge confirms it. It's umpire's call on hitting the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} survives. Short of a length and the ball skidded through after pitching, {{BATSMAN}} was early into the pull and is beaten, struck high on the thigh-pad and the ball is only clipping the bails of middle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a chance and Jofra Archer can't quite hold on, it was always going to be tough - he came running in from long-on, slid forward, goth both hands and then the ball bounced out. A mistimed heave from {{BATSMAN}} as he looked to break the shackles - got it horribly wrong and nearly was dismissed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, pushes it to sweeper cover for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BOWLER}} seals the deal for his team. Punjab win by 7 runs. Again, fires it in the blockhole, {{BATSMAN}} just about gets his bat down and digs it out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, short of a length, follows {{BATSMAN}} who mistimes the heave towards deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}} Sharma! A captain's knock. Pushes a fuller length delivery down the ground, that evades the fingers of the bowler. The ball hits the stumps and deflects towards long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, flat and short enough for {{BATSMAN}} to go back and tuck into the on-side towards long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, edged and dropped. That's an early chance that goes begging for RCB and {{BOWLER}} can't do much because it's the skipper Virat Kohli who puts it down. Short of a length and held its line just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} chased with no feet and feeds an outside edge that flew very quickly to first slip where Virat was standing a bit wide. The RCB skipper moved swiftly to his right, got both hands but grasses it. Probably, didn't anticipate it to come so quickly at him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50-run stand up as {{BATSMAN}} eases it down to long-off for a gentle single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by Dhoni. Could have been the match right there. Fine leg is inside the ring, which tempts {{BATSMAN}} into looking for the scoop. But this is a slower ball, making it really difficult to get any leverage on it. He deflects it to Dhoni's left, who dives with one hand but can't cling on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a certain chance has gone down here..pushed the googly into the off-side and set off. The man at cover rushed in, had a flick on to the sticks but missed it. {{BATSMAN}} survives\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 152.8kph, full toss, {{BATSMAN}} clobbers it through the off-side - off the top part again. Klaasen dived full length to his right at cover-point, but the ball doesn't stick. It'd be harsh to call that a drop. Saved three runs for his team there did the South African\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fired in on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} drives and gets a single to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by Nair! Oh dear. This, right here, could be game defining, considering how this partnership is starting to flourish. {{BATSMAN}} wants to take on a cutter from {{BOWLER}}, but the wily old veteran has angled it so wide that {{BATSMAN}} has to really reach out. The cut on the ball catches a thick top-edge and lobs up to the right of point. Nair never really looked settled under the ball, was still on the move as it came down and makes a mess of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, flatter one topspinning into Faf's gut, as he crouches and pulls it away to backward square leg for one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 96kph, straighter one on middle, with {{BATSMAN}} shuffling and tucking into mid-wicket. Also, a fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, run-out chance missed. KW had almost given up. Nothing going DD's way at the moment. Squeezed to point and they take on Iyer's throw, who misses the target at the non-striker's end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, runs it down to third man. 50-run partnership comes up! These two are looking ominous for Mumbai\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped first ball! 140ks away swinger from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} was caught poking without any feet movement, a thick edge flies to the right of Stoinis at first slip who gets a hand but fails to cling onto it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Negi dives forward at mid-wicket, but fails to hold onto it. Short ball and {{BATSMAN}} pulls of the top part of the bat, it kept dipping at the fielder, but carried to Negi. Tough chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a very tough chance goes down! {{BATSMAN}} prods forward and drills the cover drive. Dan Christian, at cover leaps to his right and gets a hand to it. Those are the ones that need to stick. Wasn't the case this time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, back of a length and just outside off, dabbed down towards third man and {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark with a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, sliding in on middle and leg, works it through midwicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower ball, full on leg, wristed to mid-wicket and the charging in fielder - Thakur slides and loses his balance. Luckily, no damage\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! An absolute sitter put down by Southee. Oh boy. They've already dropped Smith earlier. That hasn't quite gone well. Now another one. {{BATSMAN}} miscues the full toss to deep mid-wicket where Southee doesn't have to move. Dear me\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, tucks this short of length delivery to backward square leg. Fifty stand between these two\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, the 50-partnership up. Opens the bat face and guides a single down to third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, bad call from {{BATSMAN}} and Brendon McCullum was gone had Duminy hit from backward point. Dabbed it to the left of the fielder who had already cut off the angle with his movement, Brendon McCullum's bat got stuck in the turf and that didn't help him. Luckily for the Kiwi it didn't hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, put down, put down! Dhawan seemed to have grabbed that for a split second, but no, it's down. Back of a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} carves it off the back foot but he's hit it very close to sweeper cover. The ball was travelling though and Dhawan can't hang onto it as he was on the move\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, punched down to long-on and a big cheer from the crowd as Faf raises the bat for his fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Archer puts down a sitter. Warne is livid in the dugout but he isn't showing any emotions. {{BATSMAN}} was deceived completely by the slower delivery and miscues the big hit towards point, Archer was a bit too casual with his approach and hence spills it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by AB. Didn't pick that clearly. At least that's what he's indicating to VK. {{BATSMAN}} tried to loft this straight, en{{BOWLER}}d up hitting it miles in the air and it hung in for an eternity. AB backtracked all the way from covers, but en{{BOWLER}}d up swirling all around it before grazing the ball off his fingertips\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dabs a short of length off-cutter straight to short third man. They impetuously run across for a non-existent single. Mohit had given up. No direct hit though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, pushed through quicker from a good length, worked off the back foot through mid-wicket. 11th IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! He's been the lone ranger so far with the big names failing. Needs to carry on though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Maxi drops a skier. He's having a horrible tournament, not amongst the runs and now puts down a sitter. {{BATSMAN}} miscues the pull, gets it high on the bat and sends it high into the night sky. Maxi from deep square leg, runs in and slides with both hands cupped. Straight in and out, embarrasses himself and DD\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, was that a dropped catch? {{BATSMAN}} was down the track to play an uppish flick as Chahar failed to grab it although he put in a dive. It escaped him as he couldn't quite reach there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Rohit leaves it to Buttler coming in from sweeper when it was his catch. The ball lands bang in the middle of the two. {{BOWLER}} bowling it wide as he saw {{BATSMAN}} advancing, in the end - it was a one-handed slice in the air and the batsman got lucky\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by Bhatia. A straightforward chance. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get control of the cut and he slices it straight to third man, Bhatia didn't even need to move an inch. It was going arrow straight towards his chest. Straight in and straight out. Oops!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, that sums up the kind of day Mumbai are having. Sliced up in the air off the outside half, falls right between extra cover and sweeper cover. Rohit may have fallen on his face while diving back. He looks to be all right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He continues to keep piling on runs against the Royals. This was a short delivery again and {{BATSMAN}} helps it around the corner to reach his milestone. His job is not done yet though. Would be interesting to see how he deals with the spinners from here on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, just a punch, lining up well as he carves it through the covers. Also, a fifty -- and {{BATSMAN}} points his bat to his daughter holding it up against his shoulder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, oh boy! He almost had it till the last second there is Ashwin, would've been a stunner had he held onto it, but unfortunately, he couldn't and {{BATSMAN}} gets a lifeline. Fullish and on off, {{BATSMAN}} lifts it hard and ends up hitting it towards KXIP skipper at mid-off, who leapt high and plucked it with his right-hand. He was air-borne when he took it but just when his heels touched the ground, the ball popped out of his hands. Very unlucky\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit and Markande was a goner. Low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} shuffled across and tried to help it round the corner, found the fielder at short fine and pushed Markande for the single, he wanted to retain the strike. Markande was not even in the frame as Lamichhane missed the sticks\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a direct hit there and it was curtains for Narine. He was nowhere in the frame and had given up. Short of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} chops it to short third man, calls for a single and completes it. Mohit Sharma is the one who fails to score the direct hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He needed this. {{TEAM}} needed this. They needed their captain back in form and leading from the front and {{BATSMAN}} has done just that today. Back of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} waits and steers it down to third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, gently knocks a flatter delivery to the right of {{BOWLER}} and runs for a risky single. {{BOWLER}} slides and aims, misses by a whisker, had that hit {{BATSMAN}} would have been in trouble\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BATSMAN}} living a charmed life. Now, GG puts one down. What do you say now skipper? Umesh might be asking. It was a straightforward chance unlike his. Slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} is early into the drive, toe-ends it towards extra cover. It was going in slow motion and GG lost it in the background. The ball hit his fingers and went to ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, full on leg, flicked away to long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 140.7kph, middle-lined, quiet wristy knock down to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, once again, no room on offer for {{BATSMAN}}. It was a low full toss to {{BATSMAN}} who was backing away. Mistimed drill to cover. Brings up the 50-run stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fuller length delivery on the pads @138.4km/h, clipped away to backward square leg for a single - and that brings up the half-century opening partnership!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! It's Nitish Rana in the deep. The ball flew towards his left and he was on the move but he got there with both hands. Exquisite timing on the short-arm pull from {{BATSMAN}}. It's precisely that which gets him in trouble. Rana provides the reprieve. The ball actually hit him flush on the shoulders. That's quite an error. Huge moment\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, chance and dropped, DK with the big gloves called for the catch, Lynn - who was very near the ball moved away and then the captain shells it. That's a bad miss from DK, coming to the ball, it was another ugly slog from {{BATSMAN}}, got it off the toe-end, very high and towards square leg. Karthik had plenty of time, but the ball seemed to swirl away at the very end and that perhaps put him off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, the partnership between {{BATSMAN}} and Krunal Pandya is now 50!! Short ball, pulled away and the ball lands on the bounce to be picked up by Rahane at deep mid\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, rushes it through outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in his crease and pats it softly to cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, pulled away to deep midwicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit at the striker's end and Rahane is in. The TV umpire was called for assistance. Easy one for him. Short of a good length delivery wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} taps it towards backward point and responds to a quick call from Rahane. Pollard finds the target, but Rahane was easily home\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and {{BOWLER}} follows him with a yorker, squeezed to backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit and {{BATSMAN}} was gone. Full delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} cue-ends the drive to extra cover and takes on Rohit's throw, he's lucky that it was not on target\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower and very full on the pads, nudged towards the big spaces at mid-wicket. {{BOWLER}} has to chase it himself and that allows the single. 23rd IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}, second on the trot to start a new season. The Jamaican is making a statement, that's for sure\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, third fifty for {{BATSMAN}} in IPL and second one this season. Nudges the floater away to deep mid-wicket to reach his milestone. But he needs to carry on. Usually throws it away after reaching fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He continues his fine form.. Third of the season and this against his old team. Just a bat raise and on he goes.. Turning into the big man and {{BATSMAN}} is happy to nudge it square on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! The ex KKR player has done them a favour. {{BATSMAN}} could have been dismissed for a duck, but he has been given a life by Uthappa. Got deceived due to the slower one and ended up chipping it towards mid-on where the fielder puts down a dolly as he tries to reverse cup it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped again! This one was much easier. Yusuf Pathan, the culprit. He got to be doing better there. It was a slower one on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was early into the shot and it comes off the outside edge. It came too slowly to Pathan at point and he spills it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, catch it is the cry, but Woakes can't hold onto it. That came in at a rapid pace. Once again, {{BATSMAN}} gives the charge and this time he slashes it off the middle of the bat. The Englishman at cover-point dived to his right and half-stopped it. Saved three runs there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, game, set and match - Punjab. What a way to finish the game. {{BATSMAN}} lowers his center of gravity and sweeps it through square leg. He raises his fifty as well. Punjab win by 10 wickets\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, right in the blockhole, Faf squeezes it wide of square leg. A 100-run opening stand for {{TEAM}}. What bliss for their teammates who stand up to applaud\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! That came at a rapid pace and {{BOWLER}} could only get a hand on it. A full toss and {{BATSMAN}} hammered it straight down the ground. {{BOWLER}} stuck his left hand out and could only parry it towards mid-wicket. A single nabbed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, uppish tuck, awkwardly done but fifty it is from the young man. In the night of the eliminator, he has come good. Gutsy knock from him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Rana puts down a dolly. Full toss dished wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} slices the drive and chips straight to cover-point. Straight in and straight out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, yorker on the stumps this time, {{BATSMAN}} opens the face of the bat to point. Quick single but Stoinis makes it in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BATSMAN}} cuts it wide of backward point for a single and 50-run partnership comes up.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, edged and dropped, MS is the culprit, went late for the catch, got his fingertips and the ball pops out. This was full and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} went for the drive, played away from his body, gets a thick edge that went right in the middle of the keeper and Christian at first slip. He didn't budge, MS went for it as an afterthought and fumbled\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower delivery and was ill-timed to mid-off. Faf wanted a single and set off. ABD had to get the direct hit in but didn't take his time to throw the sticks down. Faf was gone for all money\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fullish and outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} guides it towards point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, that's it! Maiden IPL hundred. The crowd roars. What a knock from Ambati {{BATSMAN}}. He takes the helmet off, raises the bat and enjoys the moment with a big smile. He has been exceptional this season. The teams applauds and Dhoni congratulates him too. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and works it towards square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, spinning in but down leg, {{BATSMAN}} sweeps and misses, the ball deflects off his pad and nutmegs Karthik, the pair manage to cross over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, now {{BATSMAN}} almost chips one to mid-off. Ful delivery on off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} is half hearted in his attempted loft, chips it towards mid-off, Negi is quick to race across the turf and dive to his right, just out of his reach\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, chance and Hooda has dropped it. That's a massive let-off for {{BATSMAN}}, no calling at all, Hooda ran back from mid-wicket, it was perhaps Rashid's catch as he came in from deep mid-wicket. Short of a length and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was in no control over the pull, got a fat top-edge that went high and over mid-wicket. Hooda back-pedalled, wasn't in control as he went for the catch, the ball hit his palms and burst out.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit and that was over. Cutting went for the single and he was not even in the frame. Full delivery and {{BATSMAN}} digs the drive out to cover, the pair had to go and Shaw was the fielder. Took his time and fired a throw at the striker's end. Missed and Mumbai stay alive. Pant also came charging forward and slipped while collecting the ball. Had he stayed on his feet and collected it cleanly, Cutting was still gone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fires them in, 103kph, {{BATSMAN}} punches it to the right of point and quickly goes through to the other end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, goes a little wide of the crease to deliver that googly. {{BATSMAN}} nudged that out to deep mid-wicket for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, saw {{BATSMAN}} giving the charge and smartly shortened the length around middle and leg, eased away down to long-on. 50 up for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower back of a length delivery on middle, {{BATSMAN}} glances it to short fine leg. Badree was struggling had Thakur hit direct\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a low full toss in trying to bowl flat from over the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} pats it to long-on to bring the 50-run stand up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, brings up his fifty now! Wanted to sweep it to the on-side, gets an inside edge. And it hits his pads and deflects to the off-side, good enough for a single. Third consecutive fifty for Shikhar. After an average start to the tournament, he has lifted his form brilliantly for the team\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, and that might have been an outer edge! Kept low and went between the keeper's legs for a single. Fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He has set it up for {{TEAM}} for a big win. Needed this knock to bolster his confidence as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, high wide full toss, carved away through sweeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, nudged to short fine leg, {{BATSMAN}} is ambling along. Taking it easy. Had Bumrah hit direct, he would've been walking back. Not a wise decision that, and especially when your captain is Kohli. Very poor from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fuller and on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it away towards deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, run out chance missed. RCB making the same mistakes they made in their loss against KXIP. Low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and flicks it to the right of deep mid-wicket, he wanted the second and was halfway down, even given up since Pant didn't want it. But Kohli does not gather Padikkal's throw and that allows {{BATSMAN}} to make his ground back\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, now he manages a leg bye this this. Early into his swat, {{BATSMAN}} deflects it off his pads.. and runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, that left shoulder will certainly be tested with the dive. Pushed it through and got the ball to grip, {{BATSMAN}} squirts it off the outer half to the left of Iyer at cover, Rohit called for the single and had to put in the dive to make his ground. Direct hit might have made things more interesting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BOWLER}} has put down a return catch! A tossed up leggie and {{BATSMAN}} pushes with hard hands. The bowler went with both hands moving to his left, but the ball doesn't stick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, short, skidding on outside off. {{BATSMAN}} crashes it through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50 off 17 balls! Can you believe it? He has done it again. He's making a habit of it. Charges down the wicket and whips the floated delivery to deep mid-wicket. Reaches the milestone and raises the bat, acknowledges the crowd!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fuller in length and attacking the stumps, the bat-face is closed to nudge it towards square leg. Off the inside half. This is a good start for {{TEAM}} - 50 in the powerplay!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit would have made things interesting. Another slower ball, the knuckle ball this time. {{BATSMAN}} gets squared up and defends off the outside part to backward point. The fielder has a shy at the stumps, misses by a long way and Raina is hit on his wrists. A direct hit would have been curtains for the southpaw\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, drilled back to the bowler, who parries towards extra cover and that allows {{BATSMAN}} to take the single. Back-to-back fifties for {{BATSMAN}}! He certainly likes to bat at No. 3!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, rattles {{BATSMAN}} with a short delivery and cramps him up for pace as he backs away to the leg-side. Pulls and it deflects onto his helmet before falling to the floor. His skipper calls him for a quick single and it would've been a disaster if {{BOWLER}} had hit the stumps there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, short of length, {{BATSMAN}} hops back and tucks this through square leg for his fifty. Much appreciation shown from the {{TEAM}} dugout\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, finally a seam-up quick delivery, on the pads, stylishly whipped but on the bounce to deep square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, ah! A direct hit there at the striker's end would have been curtains to Eoin Morgan! {{BATSMAN}} taps this length ball to covers with soft hands and sets off. Billings chases it down and fires in a throw quickly. Misses the target just by a few inches\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, what an effort from Stokes. This is stunning fielding. He's actually caught the ball and has control over it, but he doesn't have control over his weight which is causing him to fall over the ropes. So he has to flick it back in - does so incredibly, through his legs. Lots of height from {{BATSMAN}} on the slog, fair amount of distance too. Stokes's foot is stationed just a foot inside the ropes at wide long-on, he takes it overhead, and flicks it in. They just take a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, that could have been a soft dismissal. Was a tossed up delivery and {{BATSMAN}} chipped it straight back. {{BOWLER}} was quick to move to his left and put in the dive but the ball just eludes him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Yusuf has ma{{BOWLER}} a mess of a simple chance, ran back from mid-wicket, got to the ball, went with both hands and shells it. Looks bad on replays. Coming to the ball, it was short and just outsi{{BOWLER}} off, {{BATSMAN}} swung across the line, got a fat top-edge - high and towards mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Murugan Ashwin drops a skier! The nightmare in the field continues for Kings XI. Back of a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} looks to hoick through midwicket but gets a thick top-edge that goes way up in the air, giving Murugan plenty of time to settle underneath. Almost too much time. He makes a meal of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit would have got {{BATSMAN}}! Rahane was the man at extra cover and his reaction says how much RR wanted this. Slower ball that was tapped gently into the off-side, was always a risky run and {{BATSMAN}} escapes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower and turning in, Mann knocks it through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, tight single but they get it in the end with ease. Slower and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stays back and pats it into the gap at cover. 50-run stand is up!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, sweeps it away to long leg, brings up a fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, beautiful slower ball, it's all the more effective with {{BOWLER}} bowling it. {{BATSMAN}} is deceived by the lack of pace and he has to reach out as a result. He skews it right off the toe-end to mid-on. It's fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Superb knock, but he has to go all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a risky single! What was {{BATSMAN}} thinking here? Knocks the flatter delivery to the left of the bowler and takes a single. {{BOWLER}} had the time in the world to parry it to Rahane but he decides to go for a direct hit and misses out on a run out opportunity. {{BATSMAN}} had given up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, DROPPED! Thampi at mid-wicket has tipped it over the bar! That was full on the pads and clipped by {{BATSMAN}} and uppishly but it went straight to Thampi, who made a meal of it. Mumbai having some nervy moments here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 126.9kph, solid crunchy front-footed drive, through point. Also, quite neat to get to his fifty -- his sixth IPL one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BOWLER}} shortens his length outside off, steered to the left of cover-point. {{BATSMAN}} waits for the ball to pass the fielder and then jogs across for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! An off-pace ball, {{BATSMAN}} reaches the landmark with a cut to deep point. Just a raise of the bat from {{TEAM}}'s No. 3\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, oh no! Dropped again. Kohli again. Another slower ball on a fullish length, {{BATSMAN}} tries his best to manufacture power, but doesn't manage to and skies it towards long-off, Kohli runs in and this was a much easier chance than the previous one. He wriggles his hand as to gesturing that the ball might have been wet due to dew\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}} now. Taps it to square leg and gets to the milestone. Raises his bat to the crowd and soaks in the applause\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit and {{BATSMAN}} was gone! Smith was the fielder, curses himself after he missed the target. A casual knock down the wicket from {{BATSMAN}}, goes straight to mid-off, Smithy had ample time to target all three at the non-striker's end. A big miss\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower and wider of off, eased square on the off-side for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Pollard drops a dolly at long-off. Can you believe it, I can't. Let me pinch myself. Yes, Pollard has dropped. It was a miscued loft from {{BATSMAN}}, was in the air for a long time. Pollard comes under it but for some reason fails to grab it. Rohit is stunned\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another flick, no fuss, no risk, mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, full and sliding on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} missed the flick and got a tiny bit of under-edge onto the pad. Ashwin went up for the review after a chat with his bowler, but to no avail\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, knocks this googly in front of point for a quick single. Brings up his fifty too which is greatly appreciated by his teammates as well as the home crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50 up. Length ball at 143ks, worked effortlessly through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, close shave for {{BATSMAN}}! Didn't put in the dive and trusted his long reach to bail him through. The direct hit at the bowler's end did test him to be frank but the West Indian got through in the end, only just though. It was a nicely floated off break to start with, gripped a touch and forced a leading edge towards backward point. There was a slight stutter in the running before they eventually decided to go ahead with it. No harm done in the end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit and Shankar would have been gone. {{BATSMAN}} taps it to cover and charges for a single. Surya picks it up cleanly but fails to nail the direct hit at the striker's end. And Shankar survives!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, poor running once again. There's never a run there but both batsmen just decide to go through on instinct and never take a chance to process their decision. {{BATSMAN}} steers this back of length ball with impeccable timing but Raina's dive at backward point parries it to the fielder beside him. A direct-hit would have consumed {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty of the partnership comes up! That angled in and has been pushed down to long-on for a single. {{TEAM}} in control\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, tossed up outside off, pushed to deep cover. 50 for KW. What a player and captain he has been for {{TEAM}}. And to think that he wouldn't have got in had Warner been here. Fifth fifty of the IPL and once again he is shepherding this innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! How costly a miss is this going to be? They dropped Rahul around the same time and we know what happened after. This was a full toss and {{BATSMAN}} does not get it off the middle, heaves it towards deep mid-wicket where Chahal moves to his left and lets it slip through his hands. Moeen too was running across from long-on. Did that put him off?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, starts from over the wicket and lands it full, {{BATSMAN}} works it to long-on and brings up the 50-run stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, full and flighted outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and pushes to mid-off, takes off for a risky run, and Maxi is quick to fire in the throw to the non-striker's end. {{BATSMAN}} was gone if that had hit. Not even in the frame! Where was {{BOWLER}}?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, as expected starts with a slower delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drives to sweeper cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, full and wi{{BATSMAN}}, creamed to extra cover where Ashwin does a brilliant job of a pick-up and throw. A direct-hit might've even had him, or maybe not. He's in, well in. And that's his fifty too. The job's not done yet though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower shot one, {{BATSMAN}} is early into the pull and gets a thick under edge towards square leg for a single. A throw at the striker's end, and a direct-hit. The umpire goes up to his ally upstairs, but all is well.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, low full toss on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} pushes it down to long-on and brings up the 50-run stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, take a bow, Shane Robert {{BATSMAN}}. He becomes the fourth player to have two or more hundreds in an IPL season. If at all you are struggling in life, just watch this innings folks. This is a serious life lesson. He couldn't time the ball, was only hitting it to hand, was getting beaten, his first run came off the 11th ball he faced, but he didn't lose heart. Backed himself like his captain always does and he now has a hundred off 51 balls. When his trigger is that slight movement backwards with a gentle hop of the front leg, you know as a bowler he's in the zone. He switched gears and muscled all the bowlers around. The hundred ball though was just a gentle push to the left of cover and off comes the helmet, great applause from the crowd and the {{TEAM}} dugout and soaks them all in with his hands aloft\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 33rd IPL fifty for GG. Equals Warner's record for the most number of fifties. Waves his bat around to acknowledge the Eden Garden crowd. Reaches the milestone with a wristy flick through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. A very unlike {{BATSMAN}} innings this. Waves his bat around and is congratulated by his skipper. Looked scratchy to start off and has slowly found his bearings. {{TEAM}} would want him to continue. Flatter and on off, worked to deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, pushes it with the spin to deep cover and he will retain the strike\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped, easy chance. NCN almost killed the fielder with that stare. Sheldon Jackson it was. Shortish and on the leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} flicks in a whippy manner, Jackson ran to his left slightly and covered the distance nicely, looked like he'd easily catch it but it popped out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, skates down and flicks the flatter delivery off his pads to deep mid-wicket. 100-run partnership's up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, subtle change of pace. {{BATSMAN}} plays it late as he tucks it to short fine. A good throw from the fielder would have had {{BATSMAN}} struggling at the non-striker's end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower and just outside off, driven down towards long-off for a single, raises {{TEAM}}'s 100\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, run-out opportunity missed. An ill-advised single after {{BATSMAN}} tucked to straight to short mid-wicket and took off for a single. Was always struggling and a direct-hit at the non-striker's end would've been curtains for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Fourth of the season and it has come against his former team. The sea of blue awaken to applaud the innings and he responds with a wave of the bat. Nudged with the spin past mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, we will have to wait to ascertain what happened there? Shreyas Iyer has done a commendable job to save a six. Could not control the momentum and threw the ball away, else he could have come back to catch that one - like Stokes did earlier in the day. Short ball and {{BATSMAN}} pulls off the back foot. Looks good to clear the fence but Iyer runs to his right from deep square leg, leaps and parries it back into play\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, tossed up on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and punches it to long-off for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit would have been close! Lewis was certainly in double but Mandeep's throw at the keeper's end misses by a whisker. Was a goner if it had hit. Wide yorker that was squeezed by {{BATSMAN}} towards backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! A different bowling action from {{BOWLER}} as he bowls a fullish ball outside off. Drilled to long-on for a single and {{BATSMAN}} points at his team's symbol on the shirt before rasing his bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, in the airrrrr but it drops short of Dududu Rayudu. But he does extremely well to get his hand behind the line and save the boundary. {{BATSMAN}} steps out and flicks without control, gets away with it as it lands right in front of deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, close! Shortens the length and {{BATSMAN}} taps it to the left of backward point, Miller has a shy at the striker's end and he misses, Warner might have been in trouble there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, back of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} miscues the heave and the ball bounces just in front of long-on. The 50-run stand comes up between the duo and it has come in quick time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, has switched to the yorkers. Bang on the sticks. A dance away and down in the same motion to half-drill, half-squeeze it down to mid-off. A direct hit and you never know. Because there isn't one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, shot back like a bullet by {{BATSMAN}} and the bowler spills another one. This was a tough one and almost burst through the hands of the bowler. It was a flighted ball and the batsman found it in his radar and slapped it back with ferocity for it to be fluffed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another life. At short fine leg again. This time it is Bhuvi Kumar playing godfather. {{BATSMAN}} seems keen on his walking flicks, once again doesn't keep it down and gives Bhuvi a chance with a dive to his left. In the palms and popping out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a nudge towards backward square leg for a single with which {{BATSMAN}} brings up his fifty! Just a raise of bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another full one on off-and-middle, and a punch from the crease to long-on for a single, to bring up yet another 50 for {{BATSMAN}} in this IPL. He's knocked the door down to get into the Indian side, and his batting epiphany continues\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BATSMAN}} had given up at the non-striker's end. Cummins, from mid-off, misses the stumps but he has hit {{BATSMAN}} right on the boot. He looks in some pain, but is back up quickly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, bad call from {{BATSMAN}} and Brendon McCullum was gone had Duminy hit from backward point. Dabbed it to the left of the fielder who had already cut off the angle with his movement, Brendon McCullum's bat got stuck in the turf and that didn't help him. Luckily for the Kiwi it didn't hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! It's Padikkal and it's a real toughie. A flat pull from Jonny {{BATSMAN}} and Dev dives full length to his left after sprinting forward but couldn't quite get the control over the catch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by Umesh at extra-cover. Kohli though claps in encouragement. {{BATSMAN}} moved across to the off-side, skied the lofted hit straight up. Umesh went for the conventional way, straight in and out. Will that prove to be costly?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Finch the culprit at mid-off, was late to trek backward and in the end, he did get a hand on it but spilled it. Low full toss from {{BOWLER}} that {{BATSMAN}} mistimed. The loft came off the toe end and eventually, he got lucky. Second life for the skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50-run stand up between {{BATSMAN}} and Krunal! Slaps the shortish delivery to mid-off for a single, does {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by backward point, a real sitter, RCB fans can't believe it! Full and wide, Maxi slices the drive sitting deep inside his crease, it went flat and straight to Mandeep Singh. He was a tad slow to react, straight in and straight out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slapped back. Would have been a brilliant reaction catch from {{BOWLER}}. Sticks his right hand out and only manages to cut some pace on that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, uses his wrists and directs this short of length delivery on the pads through mid-wicket for a single which brings up his 14th IPL fifty!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, edged and dropped, short of a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went hard on the cut, gets a thick edge to the right of the keeper. Ishan Kishan didn't get his foot moving, went one-handed as he dived, the ball hit his palms and bounced out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, doesn't take toll of the Free Hit, {{BATSMAN}}. Fuller ball and he wanted to smash hard down the ground. Mistimes it and it flies towards long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Siraj puts down a sitter! Will this be the decisive moment in this game? RCB will hope not. It's a massive though, it's {{BATSMAN}}. Smart from {{BOWLER}} as he kept this slower ball wider outside off, forced {{BATSMAN}} to reach it and the result was a miscue that flew at a comfortable height to sweeper cover. Siraj had it covered and then let it pop out. VK is livid\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, hunches forward and sweetly drives it to long-off. 50-stand up between the two\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 24th IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}, \"He's having a prime time\" says Sanjay Manjrekar on air. And there comes the 'Baby in the arms' celebration. Kings XI Punjab owner Preity Zinta is up on her feet applauding. {{BOWLER}} begins with a cutter on leg, turned gently to short fine leg to bring up the landmark\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, good length, in the channel just outside off. {{BATSMAN}} drops it with soft hands in front of extra cover and charges across to the other end. Rohit rushed in and under-armed a throw, but couldn't nail the target\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, was that a chance? Yes, it was - a tough chance but you need to grab those when you are defending a low score. This was dropped short by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} swivelled across on the pull, didn't bothered to keep it down. It was travelling and to his left, Sundar went with both hands, got to the ball but can't hold on. On the second viewing, it was closer to him, should take those at this level\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slightly short, {{BATSMAN}} is early into it as it stuck in the pitch a little, carved to cover where Cutting makes an excellent effort but drops it!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, full toss outside off and it has been driven through covers by {{BATSMAN}} for one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, in the air and dropped. Mohali and drop catches, the saga continues! {{BATSMAN}} wanted to repeat his effort of the second ball, he miscues this one. And it goes a long way up in the air. Rinku at long-on comes forward, he fails to get his hands in good position and it pops out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, has Stokes taken this? Ah, nope. He signals he hasn't taken it. But outstanding effort there from the Englishman. Brownie points should be handed there, of course the fairplay points. Googly from {{BOWLER}}, lands it full at the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} whacked it hard and flat to deep mid-wicket. Stokes stomped forward, dived and went with both hands only for the ball to bobble out of his hands. {{BATSMAN}}' heart would've been in his mouth for a second there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped by Bhajji. Slows the pace down, {{BATSMAN}}'s early and pops it back at Bhajji. Slightly to his right, {{BOWLER}} went with both hands and that was his undoing. Got himself into a tangle and was late to react\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} is happy with a push down the ground, 50-run stand up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, clears his front leg and shovels it down the ground. The yorkers keeping him quiet(er). Nevertheless, the half-ton comes up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, eighth IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}} - second this season. {{BOWLER}} pulls his length back, {{BATSMAN}} has ample time to muscle the pull to {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket. Just a raise of the bat from the southpaw\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, confusion but Amla survives. Nathu Singh from short fine leg failed to hit the target at the striker's end. {{BATSMAN}} got across to flick this one straight to him. He got the ball, the batsmen in the meantime were staring dead into each other's eyes - standing in the middle of the pitch. Eventually decided to go for the run. And as luck would have it. Amla stayed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slow on off, {{BATSMAN}} pats it with the turn into the off-side to bring up his half-century. It's come off 21 balls, at a snail's pace\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 142.8kph, yorker, off-lined. Jammed down the ground, coincidentally bringing up the 100-run stand as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a direct hit from {{BOWLER}} would have sent {{BATSMAN}} back to the pavilion, wasn't to be. {{BATSMAN}} gave up mid-way after knocking this into the leg-side and {{BOWLER}} did well to gather the ball quickly, missed the target by some distance though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, have you dropped the game Mr. Raina? That was a short ball, {{BATSMAN}} mistimes the slap and Raina at cover drops a dolly. Big final and {{BATSMAN}} gets a chance!!! {{TEAM}} have a huge reprieve\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, eases this full ball to extra cover, thus bringing up his fifty with a quick single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, tossed up on the stumps, nudged away behind square on the on-side, raises his 8th IPL fifty, his first this season\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, uppish, catchable but Finch lets it slip. A tough chance though. Maybe a swifter fielder would have easily had that. Shortish delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} mistimes the pull, Finch didn't move quickly to his right from long-on, tried to grab the ball with his right hand but couldn't\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 143.3kph, low full toss on leg. {{BATSMAN}} with a full face of the bat wrists it to mid-wicket, where Stokes dives across and intercepts it. And that will be a half-century for {{BATSMAN}}. His second IPL fifty. So both batsmen who were dismissed for a first-ball duck in the previous match has made it count today. Raise of the bat from the youngster to soak in the applause from the dug-out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, half-tracker to begin with, keeps really low and {{BATSMAN}} accounts for it by getting his body weight down and dragging the pull to deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower and wider, {{BATSMAN}} had to fetch, pings a single to cover to celebrate his fifty. Job half-done, his team-mates are a happy bunch in the dugout\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a direct hit at the bowler's end and AB would have been running to the pavilion. It was his call after he drove it straight to mid-off. The fiel{{BATSMAN}}r had time to shy and then missed, AB was a long way away from safety had he hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, shimmying down to the pitch of this flighted leg-break, pushes it down to long-off. It's fifty for the {{TEAM}} captain, but has he given up on this chase?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, once again, no room on offer for {{BATSMAN}}. It was a low full toss to {{BATSMAN}} who was backing away. Mistimed drill to cover. Brings up the 50-run stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, celebrates his selection into the Indian squad with a half-ton. And he's taking his team home. Gets a nothing delivery on the pads and puts it away with a glance to fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, chance and Gowtham can't hold on - a lively start in Dubai, banged in short and angling across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was in no position on the pull, gets a fat top-edge that goes high and over square leg. Gowtham circled around it, he wasn't balanced as he positioned himself, did get both hands and can't hold on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Washington Sundar at deep cover. VK slapped this length ball over cover, Sundar came running in and seemed to have judged well to snaffle the ball under his throat, but just as he rolled over to avoid the tumble, the ball slipped out of his grasp. Unlucky!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, on a good length and angling across the left-han{{BOWLER}}r, {{BATSMAN}} was early into the drive once again - ends up dragging it down towards long-on for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Raina, Oh Raina! Almost plucks out a blinder out of thin air. That was hoicked away on the on-side and the man at mid-wicket leaped up with his right hand flicking the ball over him. That was a very tough chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, chance and dropped, {{BATSMAN}} was looking clueless against {{BOWLER}}, but the bowler has been let-down by his fielder. He didn't spot the wrong 'un as he gave the charge, doesn't get anywhere close to the ball, gets a thick top-edge over cover, Sandeep back pedalled, looked certain to take the catch and then makes a mess of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, you can't keep him silent for long! Beware, other IPL teams! Fifty for Virat {{BATSMAN}} and he reaches there by dinking a full ball down to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another risky run. The running between the wickets hasn't been good all through this innings. {{BATSMAN}} taps a length ball straight to cover and calls his partner through for a quick single. Kishan fires in an underarm throw and misses the target at the striker's end. A direct hit would have been curtains for Corey Anderson\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, gets low and brings up the 50-run stand with a sweep to the right of short fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, banged in on a back of a length, angling into the pads, tucked off the pads towards wide long-on for a single - 50-run partnership between these two\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, cramps {{BATSMAN}} with this good length ball, stabbed towards extra cover for a sharp run. 50-run stand comes up! Valuable one for {{TEAM}} who now have the platform to launch at the death\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, clears his front leg and smacks this slower ball straight at {{BOWLER}}, who tried putting his hands together in front of his face but it burst through them. Half a chance, if you want to be harsh\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a direct hit from {{BOWLER}} would have sent {{BATSMAN}} back to the pavilion, wasn't to be. {{BATSMAN}} gave up mid-way after knocking this into the leg-side and {{BOWLER}} did well to gather the ball quickly, missed the target by some distance though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fired it in quick on off, {{BATSMAN}} pushes it to the right of Rohit at extra cover, who swiftly moves across and releases the throw in one motion. Hits the target but {{BATSMAN}}'s makes it in by dragging his bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, was it a chance? Hooda was the fielder, think the ball bounced just in front of him, nice start from {{BOWLER}}, full and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went hard on the drive, gets a thick edge to the right of first slip, Hooda dived to his right and got a hand onto it, saved three runs for his team\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, DROPPED!! The man at cover - Vohra had enough time to settle down under it by going back but he makes a meal of it. That was a nothing shot to a length ball and the ball scooped high up in the air and never scaled any distance. Vohra was put off by Natarajan at mid-off who was just beside him. The former could see the fast bowler from the corner of his eye and that was enough\n",
            "{{BATSMAN}} {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, very full and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} went for a reverse, ended up missing it. It might have clipped his edge, it deflects off QDK to the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 31st IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! {{TEAM}} want him to get a big one tonight, he's not done yet. Was a loopy delivery that was driven down to long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, darts this one outside off and {{BATSMAN}} punches it through covers for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Tough chance, but when you get two hands, you have to catch it. Short delivery and {{BATSMAN}} is hurried into the pull, spliced towards long-on. Umesh runs forward and across, overruns and the ball comes near his waist while he was diving forward, hits his hands and pops out. GG is not happy with the effort\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower and on off, eased down towards long-on for a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, good yorker, follows {{BATSMAN}} who was backing away. Off the right boot towards short fine leg. Direct hit would have gotten Pollard who was lazy as he ambled in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, another sweep shot through mid-wicket. The single brings up {{BATSMAN}}'s fifty. He should up the ante now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, steers it wide of backward point and they will take a single. Dhoni fumbles and {{BATSMAN}} wanted a double, MS quickly recovered and had he hit at the non striker's end, {{BATSMAN}} would have been in trouble\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped? Just grazes his fingertips. Fizzes in the quicker one on a fuller length, SKY got forward and got sucked into the drive, he miscued it off the cue end and the ball just evaded {{BOWLER}} in his followthrough. He did well to bend low, but just couldn't lock his wrists\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Chawla at deep square drops one now. Oh KKR! This is shambolic. Young {{BOWLER}} has another drop off his bowling. Not his day. Short ball, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the pull, gets a top-edge and the ball stayed in the air for an eternity. Chawla though never got anywhere close\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, buzz in the crowd as {{BATSMAN}} reaches his fifty. 32nd IPL fifty for the southpaw, mind you he was averaging around 24 against KKR before this game. A flighted delivery just outside off and {{BATSMAN}} thrashes it to long-off to bring up the milestone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, yes-no, but all is well in the end. The wrong' un from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} defends towards backward point and sets off, slight hesitation, but Dhawan was rushing towards the striker's end, the throw should have gone to the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, patted in front of backward point and the pair cross over. The 50-partnership comes up between these two\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, shuffles to take it on the pads, and tickles it to short fine. What's more - it's a fifty, stealing the opening spot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, chance and dropped, heads dropped in the RCB camp. It's Murugan Ashwin who has dropped the sitter. Lovely teasing bowling from {{BOWLER}}, slowed down the pace, this was the leg-break which turned from leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} was done in by the flight, gets a leading edge towards extra-cover. Ashwin had plenty of time as he ran back from cover, had the ball covered, juggled it twice and shells it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a drop! Shardul Thakur is the culprit. {{BATSMAN}} once again kneels down to employ the slog sweep against an in-dart. Mistimed and went to the right of mid-on, where Thakur leapt and couldn't snaffle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped, tough chance though! Fizz the man there at short third man. Slower delivery wide outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} checks the dab, gets a leading edge that flies to the left of short third, Fizz moved to his left and dived, but couldn't hold on. Massive moment in the game\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, back to off breaks, is {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} slaps it to sweeper cover to hoist a fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, oh close! Risky single attempted and {{BATSMAN}} had to dive full-length to make his ground. Tucked into the leg-si{{BATSMAN}} and got the nod from his skipper. {{BOWLER}} swiftly moved across and collected the ball before hurling the stumps at the non-striker's end, that was a nervy moment for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. 11th in the league and Rajasthan's mentor, Shane Warne picked him as the player to watch out for in this edition. He's started off nicely. Picked the slower delivery and works it into the open mid-wicket area\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, appeal for run-out. A lazy single from {{BATSMAN}} and this might cost him. Oh dear! {{BATSMAN}} is short, but {{BOWLER}} has missed the ball and broke the stumps with his hands, NOT OUT is the call. That's poor cricket all around, the drifter from {{BOWLER}}, spun away from outside off, Hasan pushed it to the right of cover-point and set-off for a quick single. He was very casual in his running, took the big steps when he spotted the danger, but was still short of making his ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BATSMAN}} drank elixir today! Gets another life. Short ball and he pulls it to long-on, who dives forward but fails to get underneath the ball. Got hands to it so will go down as a chance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slices it towards the fielder at point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, quicker and on leg, turned to deep backward square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, steered away to third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped. Jaddu it is! Went to his right - not his natural side. Got both hands to it and he's livid with himself for putting it down. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} punches it uppishly, hit very well, backward point flew to his right, there was a dive but the ball popped out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Second of the season. He started aggressively today but has taken a step back once Bairstow went berserk. Looks like he will bat through the innings. Just a raise of the bat to celebrate the milestone. {{BOWLER}} follows {{BATSMAN}} and is tucked away through mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit and {{BATSMAN}} was running back. Finally he connects with one of his heaves, not middled though and finds Yusuf at mid-wicket. The shy is at the bowler's end and it is way off target\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, difficult return catch dropped. Drilled and hit with power to the left-hand of {{BOWLER}}, it didn't stick. Must have stung him, but he doesn't show any emotion\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Henriques over-trusts his legs and spoils a catch that could have been 'the one' for Dhawan who ran from sweeper towards this skier. {{BATSMAN}} had thrown his bat at a wide ball and sliced off the outer half. If not for his luck and Henriques ambitions, {{BATSMAN}} would have been walking back\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, short of length around off, {{BATSMAN}} back cuts it to third man. The 50-run stand comes up and the rebuilding work is done, now they need to kick-on and to get a par total\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50 for {{BATSMAN}} now. Cracked through cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slower length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drills it through cover and brings up a sparkling fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Gets there with a risky single. Hits it straight to point and set off. Anureet Singh fumbles and allows the duo a single\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! The ex {{TEAM}} player has done them a favour. {{BATSMAN}} could have been dismissed for a duck, but he has been given a life by Uthappa. Got deceived due to the slower one and ended up chipping it towards mid-on where the fielder puts down a dolly as he tries to reverse cup it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, pacy fuller length delivery at 136.2kph, {{BATSMAN}} meets it with a crisp drive to sweeper cover and brings up Delhi's 100\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a direct hit might have been interesting - {{BATSMAN}} pushed this one in front of mid-on and called for a quick single - it was always a dicey single - Shreyas was quick on the ball and has a shy - had he hit, {{BATSMAN}} would have been short, despite the dive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped -- a massively tough one, but nevertheless, it's put down. {{BATSMAN}} reverse-sweeps, and Krunal Pandya - backward point - dives to his right, gets both palms, and can't hold on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, a dazzling fifty for Robbie! That was short and he was quick to swat the pull away for a single. Soaks in the applause as the {{TEAM}} camp is happy and so is the skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He tries to cut this into the off-side, chops it towards backward point. Been an excellent innings. Absorbed the pressure, didn't take too many risks and has almost taken his side home\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, drives to the right of a diving bowler and marks his fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 140kph, and sliced away even faster. Keeps it wide making {{BATSMAN}} stretch every cell of his body in getting close. Does with a square stab. Brings up the 50 between the duo as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BOWLER}} keeps it full and just outside off, driven back at the bowler who gets a hand onto it and deflects it away towards long-on, that single raises another fifty for {{BATSMAN}} - who also has the orange cap back with him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, oh! Faf almost pulls off a stunner. This would have been the catch of the tournament. {{BATSMAN}} struck the off-drive uppishly towards mid-off, Faf times his jump perfectly and goes with one hand, it doesn't stick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BATSMAN}} slogs and is in danger there. Guptill has it covered with a reverse cup at deep mid-wicket. Hold on, he is not having a good day and so, he drops it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, short, but nothing at all on the ball. {{BATSMAN}} has to wait, wait some more, and then when he pulls, drags it away into the leg-side with no timing whatsoever\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, in the airr and Vijay Shankar shells it down. It was a tough chance as {{BATSMAN}} had hammered it hard. And guess what? {{BATSMAN}} could've still been dismissed had Iyer - who was backing up, effected a direct-hit at the non-striker's end. {{BATSMAN}} had given up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Bhuvi drops a straightforward catch at extra cover but SRH won't mind match. Williamson and Co. are in all smiles at the dug-out. Hammered airly, went straight to Bhuvi, who mistimed his jump and en{{BATSMAN}}d up shelling it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, FIFTY for the combo! A reverse attempted by {{BATSMAN}} and he manages to locate the man at short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped - Pollard of all people, and the simplest take of them all. {{BATSMAN}} goes on a knee, swings, top-edges, skies. Pollard meanwhile runs in from long-on, casually, settles, gets both palms and then lets it pop out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! It took an age for the ball to come down from the sky, and it bursts right through Agarwal's hands in the deep. Another big swipe from {{BATSMAN}} which he mistimes to deep mid-wicket. And another repreive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, chance and Shreyas can't hold on - would have been a good catch had he held, the ball was always dying onto him, just got his fingertips, but the ball popped out. {{BATSMAN}} is done in by the slowness of the pitch and is early into the shovel, lobbed off the inner half and towards mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, oh a mix-up. Could have been a lot more. But for these missed aims. A polite knock to mid-wicket from {{BATSMAN}} and he just charges out to get away. Rohit meanwhile stands half way down the pitch hoping his partner would return. None of that happening though. And the Wankhede doesn't let sound travel, even across the pitch. Rohit has to thank a wayward throw\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty #30. Gets there with a standing dab wide of point. All so nonchalant\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Would you believe it? I have lost count of the number of chances {{BATSMAN}} has got today. Flighted delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} kneels down and sweeps to deep backward square, went straight to Yusuf and he split it. He was on the move a bit and that put him off. He's been whisked away from that position by a stoic GG\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, waits on the slower delivery by hanging on to the back foot but inside halves the ball away into the on-side for a single. Fifty for {{BATSMAN}} as well. This has been one cracking innings from the English all-rounder. Has delighted the crowd with some luscious big hits. Even Kohli gets up and applauds this quick fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Miscommunication between Karthik and Uthappa and they've put down a sitter. Uthappa had called for it but DK tries to go for the catch and the former ends up spilling it. {{BATSMAN}} had horribly miscued this slog as the top-edge ballooned into the off side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, is that a bird? Is that a plane? Oh it is Mandeep Singh on his flying ways. {{BATSMAN}} goes through with yet another ones of his delightful airy drives. Is in the process of admiration just as Mandy runs across at the long-off fence, leaps and pulls it back into the field of play. Almost plucked it out while landing down too. Oof\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, that's a brilliant display of fielding by Karn Sharma in the deep. Times his jump to perfection, plucks his right arm out and grabs it before he parries it into play near the third man fence. Was short and wide outside off as {{BATSMAN}} upper cut it towards third man and Sharma saves five runs for his team with this valiant effort\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. On a surface where all the other batsmen have struggled, he has stroked a flawless half century. The whole team in the dugout stand up to applaud. Tossed up on off, {{BATSMAN}} wrists it to long-on and reaches the milestone\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run. David Miller drops a dolly. It hung in the air for an eternity, {{BATSMAN}} cursed himself and almost started walking to the pavilion, but luck seemed to have smiled on him. {{BATSMAN}} looks to go straight with a loft, doesn't locate the middle. It goes up in the air towards mid-off, Miller comes in sets himself and looks to take it reverse cupped, it just doesn't stick. Hits him on the side of the palm and drops to the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, wide on the crease again is {{BOWLER}}, straightens it on off stump, it takes a thick edge from {{BATSMAN}} before rolling to short third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 92kph, very full and around off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg for a hoick-across-the-line and inside-edges it to mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. His first of the season. After a couple of 40s, he finally has a half-century to his name. That should bring back the confidence in him. Williamson walks up and congratulates him on the milestone. The knuckle ball which is short in length, {{BATSMAN}} is early into the pull and lobs it off the edge to fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, I can't believe my eyes. Manish Pandey has dropped a sitter by his standards. It's MS {{BATSMAN}} too! Pandey is one of SRH's finest fielders. Flighted delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} steps out and mistimes the loft, hit flat to long-on, Pandey was close to the rope, took it too casually and it popped out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, dropped! Tom Curran did a remarkable job of getting to the ball. So, tough to call it a drop. Flighted outside off, {{BATSMAN}} sans footwork went for the inside out loft, nowhere near the middle and the ball skied towards deep extra cover. Curran ran forward, dived full length and got fingertips to it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, {{BATSMAN}} and {{BOWLER}} collide. Short and slow outside off, {{BATSMAN}} cuts it on the bounce to backward point. Both were ball watching and {{BATSMAN}} dashed into the bowler, {{BOWLER}} is down on the ground and {{BATSMAN}} makes his crease. The {{TEAM}} skipper goes back to check on {{BOWLER}} and the Englishman is fine\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, direct hit and {{BATSMAN}} was gone. Hesitation between the two batsmen and it was the {{TEAM}} skipper who was in trouble. He tried to force the good length delivery through the off-side and mishit it towards point, started to go for the single before stopping, Lynn kept going and that left {{BATSMAN}} with no choice. He put in a desparate dive but Shankar's throw was not on target\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, taps a length ball to short cover and sets off for a risky single. Parag fails to hit the target at the striker's end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, Raina drops a sitter! Not only his batting, but his fielding hasn't been great either. A couple of misfields earlier in the innings and now he puts one down. {{BATSMAN}} got deceived due to the slower delivery as he miscued it towards mid-off where Raina fails to cling on to the catch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, just 7 runs off the over. Overpitched delivery at 121.5kph, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and absolutely smashes it. {{BOWLER}} is brave to stick his right hand out - over his head - and parry it towards the mid-wicket region. Too harsh to call it a drop...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, 50-run stand up between this pair as {{BATSMAN}} squeezes the yorker to square third man. They need to hit a few big ones here..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, slight hesitation but they get the single as extra cover can't get across. {{BATSMAN}} drove this gently and wanted one from the outset but Bairstow was a bit unsure. It eventually goes down to long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, 1 run, in the airrrrr but it drops short of Dududu Rayudu. But he does extremely well to get his hand behind the line and save the boundary. {{BATSMAN}} steps out and flicks without control, gets away with it as it lands right in front of deep mid-wicket\n"
