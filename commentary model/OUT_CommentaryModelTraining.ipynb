            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! What a wicket that is. Two in the over for {{BOWLER}}. A game-changing over? Will only know once the match is done. But certainly {{TEAM}} now get a chance to come back into the game. Wasn't a great delivery, off-pace and down leg, but {{BATSMAN}} found Dhawan at deep backward square. After taking the catch, he puts a finger to his lip and points to the crowd suggesting to keep quiet. Typical Dhawan. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The off pole has gone for a walk! What a sight for any fast bowler and {{BOWLER}} is thrilled! Horror stroke from {{BATSMAN}} though and he has wasted another start. Slightly short of a good length around off, this was just above 145kph and that's what probably foxed {{BATSMAN}} who was expecting the slower ball. No excuse for the shot though, a wild slog across the line and misses it completely. Ruffled his pad before crashing into the stumps. DD are right on top here. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 21(16) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} closes his eyes and grimaces. While {{BOWLER}} is being mobbed by his mates. A thick leading edge and {{BOWLER}} timed his leap to perfection and came up with the return catch in two hands. The catch was all about the leap. Two wickets in an over and the pressure multiplies many times on de Villiers. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! Wow! Has Samson hurt his head? Landed badly on it. Slower short ball and {{BATSMAN}} takes it on, he miscues the pull to deep backward square, Samson misjudges it slightly as he overruns it but adjusts well to leap up and take it over his head, he tumbles backwards and that's when he hits his head onto the ground. Seems to be fine.. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 12(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! Looks to launch the slower ball and holes out at long-off. That was touch slower off the deck and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to muscle it down the ground only to find the man in the deep. Thakur after it taking does a gig. CSK continue their good work at the death. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 26(16) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! It's game on here at the Chinnaswamy! {{BATSMAN}} has played completely down the wrong line of a full ball and is castled comprehensively. The crowd erupts. Rusty footwork from {{BATSMAN}} as he presses forward to drive, the ball didn't seem to do a great deal. Might have held its line a touch if anything. {{BATSMAN}} played way inside the line of it, maybe anticipating it to come back. The off and middle stumps are clobbered. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! First wicket down! {{BOWLER}} sees the batsman charge down and bangs it short. {{BATSMAN}} is cramped for room, but still persists with his pull shot. Doesn't middle it and the ball balloons up on the leg-side. Tiwary, who had a good stint with the bat, runs to his left from deep mid-wicket and gobbles it up. {{BATSMAN}} c Manoj Tiwary b {{BOWLER}} 14(9) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! What a soft, soft dismissal. He had so much time on the back foot, how did he even edge it! Shortish googly from {{BOWLER}}, sits up outside off. {{BATSMAN}} is back in the crease to tamely pat it away through point, but all he does is chop it back onto the stumps. What a spell from {{BOWLER}} to give Mumbai hope from a pretty hopeless situation. He's done though, will the others rise? {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 12(12) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} is leaving the Lions flummoxed. This was the wrong 'un, pitched just outside off and spun back into the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} didn't read it one bit, played for the straighter one, beaten on the inside edge and struck bang in front of middle. The height wasn't an issue, the ball would have been crashing into the leg-stump. Easy call for the umpire and Gujarat Lions slip into further trouble. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rashid Khan!! {{BATSMAN}} departs after a handy knock! Time for Dre Russ to walk in next. Was a short ball around middle and leg and {{BATSMAN}} pulled it straight to deep mid-wicket. The Afghan leggie charges to his left and takes a fine sliding catch to bring an end to {{BATSMAN}}'s stay at the crease. {{BATSMAN}} c Rashid Khan b {{BOWLER}} 30(25) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! Short of length, {{BATSMAN}} heaves into the on-side but he's in no control of it whatsoever. The ball has flown off the top-edge. He's gone. Pune making a match of this. {{BOWLER}} might have cut his fingers across the ball. {{BATSMAN}} wants to heave it away off the front foot but it's onto him much quicker than he thinks. Essentially, it was a break-free short after having been kept quiet. Third man runs in and holds on. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 3(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Kohli looks livid, but he has a part in this dismissal. Coming to the ball, it was short and wide from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} chopped it to the left of backward point. The fielder dived to his left and made a half-stop. That made Kohli set-off for a quick single before being sent back. The throw is at the bowler and he doesn't make a clean stop. The ball rolls away a few yards away from him, this makes {{BATSMAN}} think there's a run and he hares off - without even having a glance at his partner. Kohli was back to the action, by the time he turned around - he saw his partner near him. {{BOWLER}} throws the ball to his keeper who does the rest. {{BATSMAN}} run out ({{BOWLER}}/Dhoni) 7(12) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Head Run Out!! 1 run completed. Matters taken upstairs. Some confusion while wanting the second run and Head sacrifices his head for his skipper. Is forced to run back and even a wide throw gives {{BOWLER}} enough time to grab and catch him short. {{TEAM}} lose another. Was a walking flick through mid-wicket and {{BATSMAN}} always wanted the second. The only problem - there never was two there. Head bears the brunt. Head run out (Shreyas Iyer/{{BOWLER}}) 2(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! The junior {{BOWLER}} continues to impress. Some of the fantasy fanatics are cursing_____ you know who! Baz follows his instincts, shimmies down and looks to bash the young man over long-on. Was nowhere near the pitch of the delivery, beaten by length and done in the drift and dip. MS slaps the bails in flash. {{BATSMAN}} st Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 49(32) [4s-5 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! Full toss at the stumps, should have disappeared too. Instead, {{BOWLER}}'s got very lucky. {{BATSMAN}} swung across it too early, and lobbed it up off a leading edge. No mistake from Watson at extra cover, with his hands like buckets. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 22(17) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Morris!! Second wicket for {{BOWLER}}. He's got two big ones - Warner and now {{BATSMAN}}. Slower short delivery, kept climbing on the Kiwi, who went for the pull and only managed a fat top edge towards deep square leg. He was never going to in control of the shot as the ball got big on him. Smart bowling from {{BOWLER}} as well, rolled his fingers across at the last moment. DD have pulled things back nicely after the powerplay. Just 26 runs scored and two wickets taken. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Morris b {{BOWLER}} 24(24) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Holes out in the deep. Swiped across the line of this slower ball, but got it right off the toe-end. The line was a touch wide of off, which didn't work in his favour either as he had to fetch it. Right down the throat of Suryakumar at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 11(13) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! And {{BOWLER}} wins the battle.. Huge wicket at this stage. {{BATSMAN}} shuffled across and aimed to go across the line, {{BOWLER}} cleverly rolled his fingers across the ball, the top-edge went straight up and Pant settled under it. Punjab have kept losing wickets at the wrong time today. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 43(30) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Gone! {{BOWLER}} learns quickly from his mistake this time. He also gives a send off to {{BATSMAN}}. Dug in short and it was pacy, {{BATSMAN}} swivels to play the pull but only manages a glove to Parthiv, who takes a good catch over his head. {{BATSMAN}} c Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 15(13) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! What a soft dismissal! {{BATSMAN}} is generally good against spin, not this time. Quickish slider and he pats it back down the track. Couldn't keep it down and a dolly of a return catch for {{BOWLER}} who accepts it like a craving kid who gets a candy. Falling apart now, the Mumbai Indians. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! Nope, the Mo experiment ain't coming good today. {{BOWLER}} hits his hard good length, {{BATSMAN}} tries crashing through the line as he goes to loft an uppish drive. The ball though gets big, gets the fat miscue and Prithvi Sahw at cover can catch, tonight. {{BATSMAN}} c Prithvi Shaw b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by D Arcy Short!! He's got him, he's got him. {{BOWLER}} is running around with an arm raised. Pretty much a half-tracker which {{BATSMAN}} pulls in the vicinity of deep mid-wicket. It's D'Arcy Short there, who leaps across for an excellent take. Oh what a game-changer this. {{BATSMAN}} c D Arcy Short b {{BOWLER}} 57(30) [4s-6 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! That's just {{BOWLER}} playing with the length. And his knuckles, maybe. Clocks 134ks but gets the ball to hold in the pitch, as {{BATSMAN}} charges out in ambition. Tries to check his shot but ends up slicing it off the splice to short cover. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to go leg-side, and go big, but was hoaxed by the ball never arriving at all. Where are we headed? More importantly, where are {{TEAM}}? {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 6(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Agarwal!! This is turning out to be a awful start for the Capitals - another soft dismissal and {{BOWLER}} is on cloud nine. He shortened his length and got one to angle across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to work it to the on-side, closed the bat-face early and the front-edge looped straight into the grateful hands of Mayank at extra-cover. As simple as it gets and the Capitals have been reduced to 13 for 3. {{BATSMAN}} c Agarwal b {{BOWLER}} 7(13) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} finally runs out of luck. Got lucky on quite a few occasions earlier but not this time. This was a short one around leg, he tried to pull it away but the ball clips his thigh, then it deflects off his glove to disturb the stump. He has given the start {{TEAM}} required though. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 27(17) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! {{BATSMAN}} walks. Pin drop silence at Chepauk. Is that the match? Well, there is still Bravo - last game's match-winner. {{BATSMAN}} waits as the umpire checks for a front foot no-ball, {{BOWLER}} is fine and {{BATSMAN}} continues walking. Clever bowling from {{BOWLER}}, slowed it up a touch and kept it outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was down on his knee to play the sweep, through the shot early and the under edge is found. Karthik has a juggle before completing the catch. {{BATSMAN}} didn't even wait for the umpire. Started walking as soon as he saw the catch taken. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 25(28) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jordan!! One brings two as they say. Two wickets in two overs for Punjab and both set batsmen back in shed for Delhi. Not a wise shot from {{BATSMAN}} at this stage. It was fuller just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} knew the mid-off was inside the ring, so got tempted and wanted to lift it over him. But his bat turns in his hands at the point of impact and as a result of which he miscues and offers a dolly to Jordan. Third wicket for {{BOWLER}}, brilliant. {{BATSMAN}} c Jordan b {{BOWLER}} 39(32) [6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Binny!! The googly it is. Got away with earlier in the over but falls this time around. Was a googly around leg, {{BATSMAN}} went for the sweep and got a top-edge. Binny at short fine leg somehow manages to hold on to the catch. That swirled in the air but Binny makes sure to not disappoint the leggie. {{BATSMAN}} c Binny b {{BOWLER}} 52(35) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Oh, it's ugly when a batsman with a Test hundred in almost every country tries circus tricks. {{BOWLER}} fires in the googly on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets across his stumps and tries to whack it away behind point with a reverse sweep, misses it altogether and ends up making a fool of himself. The furniture is knocked over, and a the flashing red bails reflect ominous signs for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(12) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Yep, another aimless heave and the inside-edge doesn't need fielders to catch it; it takes care of crashing it the stumps. So {{BATSMAN}} didn't quite want to be playing sensibly anymore and not-find the boundaries with Kohli and AB sitting inside. And he clears out his front leg, swings big, and misses it completely. He swung so hard that his top hand slipped off the handle as well. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 56(42) [4s-8]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! {{BATSMAN}} thought that he would get away with it but DRS comes to Sunrisers' rescue. Short delivery outside off, Robin tries to run that down to third man but ends up getting a slight edge to that. UltraEdge confirms the same and the ploy to open with {{BATSMAN}} has back fired. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 3(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} has been given OUT LBW and he wants a review. This looked adjacent to the naked eye. It's a fair delivery and there's no bat as well. The impact seems to be in front of middle, the height isn't an issue. No edge, says Ultraedge. Hawk-Eye in, three reds and {{BATSMAN}} is OUT. Simple call for umpire Ravi and {{BOWLER}} has struck with his last ball. This was full and came back with the angle, {{BATSMAN}} shuffled a long way across on the flick, once he missed, it was curtains, decided to take a chance as he reviewed, but to no avail. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Suicidal running and DD lose another wicket. Remember, Pant was involved in a run-out against CSK as well where he ran his skipper out. Today, it's the turn of {{BATSMAN}}, who has to depart early. Defended to the right of the bowler and {{BATSMAN}} took off, Pant responded and stopped, throwing his partner under the bus. {{BOWLER}} moves across quickly and lasers a throw to the keeper, who does the rest. {{BATSMAN}} run out ({{BOWLER}}/Saha) 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Run out appeal here. Slower and wider, {{BATSMAN}} dragged it to long-on, where the fielder ran across and fired a throw to Buttler, with the batsmen trying to go for the second. {{BATSMAN}} wasn't sure about the second, even put his hand up but Rahul was through, and he had to oblige. That's touch and go actually, the run out. Diving {{BATSMAN}}'s bat is just about at the line when Buttler takes the bails off. Oh dear, that's a tough one for the third umpire. And it's been given out.. Small margins and it goes against the batsman this time. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Binny/Buttler) 9(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! Vital, vital breakthrough! Might easily make a difference of about 10-15 runs to the eventual total. The deadly {{BATSMAN}} has to depart but not before he has produced another thrill-a-minute epic. Backed away to make room for the big shot but one hand comes off in the process. Didn't get hold of it and skied this high towards long-on where Stokes moved to his left a fair bit to judge the skier perfectly. Two massive wickets in the over for RR, just the comeback they were looking for. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 69(29) [4s-7 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! The CSKians go up, {{BATSMAN}} starts to walk. Doesn't wait for the umpire's decision. The cross-seamed short ball from Shardul {{BOWLER}} and that's the reason for the extra bounce. {{BATSMAN}} read the length and line, but couldn't account for that tad extra bounce. Looked to ramp it towards third man and got a feather on it. MS won't drop those. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 20(13) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! {{BOWLER}} gets the better of Virat {{BATSMAN}}! Gets him with a short ball. Pounds it into the pitch and gets it to angle in into the body, {{BATSMAN}} hadn't really moved back, but still goes through with the shot (pull) and the top-edge lands in the bucket hands of Hardik Pandya at square leg. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 46(32) [4s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Plumb. Dead. Gone. A straight delivery, angling in and the {{BATSMAN}}'s been fooled by the pace as he plays all around this with his flick after plonking his front leg in front of off. It can't get easier for umpires, and for {{BATSMAN}} with the decision to not review. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 10(5) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Okay, I take my words back. Masterstroke it has turned out to be from KW. There was risk in bringing the left-arm spinner but the idea was to tempt {{BATSMAN}} into a rash stroke. He did get a couple away but not this time. It was pushed through quicker in line of the stumps and he went for a slog sweep across the line. Missed and it pinged him flush on the pads. Easy call for the umpire as far as the LBW is concerned. {{BATSMAN}} did wonder about the review but then rightfully continued walking. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 20(13) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Agarwal!! {{BOWLER}}, in his debut IPL, bags the purple cap in the second game. Five wickets for the youngster, third of the game. Oh scratch that, actually got only one wicket in the first game. So doesn't have the cap yet. Needs one more. He nicely floats and invites the lofted hit, {{BATSMAN}} was tempted to back himself and go for the big hit, mistimed it to long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Agarwal b {{BOWLER}} 30(27) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Shivam Mavi!! Both the set openers are back in the hut now. That was bowled outside off and was spinning away from the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} goes ahead with his chip shot and times it straight to the subsitute fielder who comes running in and takes it. Are KKR getting back in this match? With two new batsmen at the crease getting those odd boundaries might get a bit difficult. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Shivam Mavi b {{BOWLER}} 39(26) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Naman Ojha!! Two wickets in two overs and GL are losing gas towards the end. A short ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} went across his sticks and tried to lap/scoop it over short fine, doesn't succeed as he gets a faint nick and Ojha takes a simple catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Naman Ojha b {{BOWLER}} 30(32) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Roy!! Looked like a googly but replays show it's a quick slider, angling across from over the wicket, which gets the wicket. {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the track, isn't quite to the pitch of the ball and ends up slicing it to long-off, where Jason Roy runs in and takes the catch reverse-cupped. {{BATSMAN}} c Roy b {{BOWLER}} 48(28) [4s-4 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gambhir!! Oh goodness! Gambhir nearly made a meal of this catch. He somehow clasps onto it. A full ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} threw his bat, gets a top-edge that goes high in the air towards extra cover. Gambhir set himself under it, the ball was swirling in the air. The ball popped out of his hand, after juggling with it, he manages to gobble it up. {{BATSMAN}} c Gambhir b {{BOWLER}} 4(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Taken! {{BOWLER}} ends the innings with a couple of wickets. A fast full toss on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gave it his all to clear the field near long-on, but could not get the distance. Hardik is well inside the rope as he takes it calmly. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Finally, {{BOWLER}} Kumar has a wicket against his name this season, in his fourth game. Well disguised slower delivery, not the knuckle ball, the traditional off-cutter, {{BATSMAN}} didn't read this and played an ugly swipe across the line, only to see the off pole cartwheeling. Will be interesting to see if Bhuvi refrains from bowling the knuckle ball. People have been picking them easily of late off his hand! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(11) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Miller!! The small little things that you do produce the bigger things. That Vohra stop kept {{BATSMAN}} on strike and what happens next? The Kent man miscues a loft to long-on. Takes a couple of steps down, not close to the ball but still goes through with the loft. Right off the toe-end and almost had enough to clear Miller, who set himself up right on the edge of the circle and clasped it. {{BATSMAN}} c Miller b {{BOWLER}} 55(40) [4s-9]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Blind swinging from {{BATSMAN}}. Advances and goes for an almighty swing, but {{BOWLER}} is clever enough to bowl this wide outside off stump and force the batsman to reach out, completely missed and Tare, the sub keeper, does the rest. {{BATSMAN}} st (sub)Tare b {{BOWLER}} 5(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Another attempted reverse sweep and Pant reckons there was some glove on that. The Capitals have reviewed the caught behind call. This looks close, think {{BATSMAN}} might be in trouble, looked like a feather on the glove. UltraEdge in and there's a minor spike when the ball is past {{BATSMAN}}'s gloves. That's enough for the third umpire to overturn the original call. {{BATSMAN}} is OUT. Think it's a fair decision from the third umpire, Chris Gaffaney. The spike wasn't huge, but there seemed to be a deviation when the ball went past the gloves - {{BATSMAN}} was attempting the reverse sweep to one that drifted across him - caught the glove and Pant stood low to hold on. A wicket against the run of play, the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} departs. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 45(33) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nabi!! Is there a late twist? Slower delivery going across, {{BATSMAN}} lifts the ball away and has been taken by the man at long-off. Was that shot needed? A few dinks here and there would have done it. But {{BATSMAN}} wanted to go for the glory shots and slammed it away uppishly without any timing to be caught. {{BATSMAN}} c Nabi b {{BOWLER}} 9(12) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! First IPL scalp for Varun {{BOWLER}} in this edition of IPL. And it's the big fish - {{BATSMAN}}. A blip in concentration for {{TEAM}}'s captain after the break. A nothing shot really. This gave an impression of stopping upon reaching the batsman. Teased {{BATSMAN}} into pushing at it, he went a bit too hard and chips it back to the bowler. {{BOWLER}} doesn't drop those. It was catching practice indeed. KKR camp are elated. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 36(30) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! Smart slower stuff. {{BATSMAN}} never comfortable when he has to slog without getting set. Today's no different. Doesn't quite get his power right on the cutter that {{BOWLER}} digs into the pitch on length. Tries whacking it over long-on, but AB's there. And he's good to take it reverse-cupped. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 5(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Ah, the perils of timing them so damn well. But {{BOWLER}} - to his credit - is really brave to toss it up despite the carnage, and is really full as well. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get under, just whipping it down the pitch, hard, flat, and {{BOWLER}}'s stuck out palms come in between. THIS is silence. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 84(49) [4s-9 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stoinis!! Second wicket for {{BOWLER}}. Needless from {{BATSMAN}}. The asking rate is under control and he wants to go after RCB's best bowler. Pays the price for doing so. Smart bowling from {{BOWLER}}, though. A slow, tossed up ball outside off, which spun further away from the right-handed batsman. {{BATSMAN}} decides to thump it over long-off, miscues and Stoinis takes a calm catch well in front of the boundary ropes. {{BATSMAN}} c Stoinis b {{BOWLER}} 59(43) [4s-8 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Miller!! No Mohali heroics from Ashton {{BATSMAN}} tonight. Unfortunately he doesn't have the time to play the nudge-and-nurdle game, prefers to attack and uses his long levers to tonk {{BOWLER}} into the stands, wasn't to be. Connects right off the cue end and Miller ain't dropping that at long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Miller b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! 144ks inducker nails him in front. Gets the ball to skid on after bowling the last ball a tad slower, and hurries him into a surprise. Nipped back in and rapped the pad above the knee-roll, but since {{BATSMAN}} was caught so deep in the crease - having read neither the line, length or the pace - he looks plumb. Umpire thinks for a few seconds and raises his finger. Ball tracking: shows it clipping the top of leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja !! Miscued slog-sweep. It's a normal leg-break, but {{BATSMAN}}'s adventures of wanting to smoke this over the longest part of the ground - cow corner - ends up in the hands of the fielder out there. Clearly not full enough to be slogging these .. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 9(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Bowled 'im. Top over under pressure from the Kiwi. Mumbai could get only 5 runs off it. Round the wicket and though he misses the yorker length, his pace makes up for it, {{BATSMAN}} does not lay bat on the pacy full toss and has his off-stump uprooted. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Washington Sundar!! Bowls a googly last ball, messes up a young head and gets him with a wide one. Age matters. {{BATSMAN}} sees the width and throws his hands at it, only to slash it straight to Washington Sundar at short third man. Straight to him. He was looking good but had to reach out here, meaning he failed to keep the ball down. He's out but manages to impress in his little stint again, doesn't he? {{BATSMAN}} c Washington Sundar b {{BOWLER}} 31(24) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shakib!! Smart catch from Shakib and Hooda can breathe easy. On a good length and angling into {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he was looking to tuck it towards the on-side, perhaps played a tad too early, the ball looped in the air and was dropping in front of short square leg. Shakib was alert though, dives forward, got both hands underneath and scooped the catch. {{BATSMAN}} falls cheaply once again and {{TEAM}} have lost an early wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Shakib b {{BOWLER}} 11(10) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! {{BATSMAN}} comes a cropper today. That was a length ball and the batsman got cramped up, chipped it away and Pollard takes a good tumbling catch over his head. {{TEAM}} have a body blow here. Their in-form skipper is gone. The batsman tried to back away a bit and then played the shot a bit too early. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Knocked up clean. {{BATSMAN}} goes for a very un-Kotla-approved drive - you know, away from his body, on the up - missing the line completely and with {{BOWLER}} making it worse with the extreme jag back in off the pitch. And off-stump's on a cartwheel. And so are Delhi's hopes tonight. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 7(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! {{BATSMAN}} perishes. One shot too many. Shane {{BOWLER}} digs it in short. The ball didn't get up as much as he wanted it to. Hurries onto {{BATSMAN}}'s pull and all he manages to do is to miscue it to mid-wicket. An easy catch for Kedar Jadhav. {{BATSMAN}} c Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 26(22) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Wicket after the break. It will not matter for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} has done the job he was sent out to do. In fact might have done more than they would have expected. Quick short delivery and {{BATSMAN}} takes it on, feathers an edge and Jadhav had to jump up to glove that. Some respite for RCB from all the madness. {{BATSMAN}} c Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 54(17) [4s-6 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}}'s hot and cold season comes to an end with him eating up a review in an all important final when he was absolutely dead in front. Lovely bowling from {{BOWLER}}. Leggie from the leggie, {{BATSMAN}} was hanging back to defend, missed the ball, the impact was on the front pad first before it smashed into the back pad. Impact in line with middle and it's hitting the top of middle stump. Mumbai have an opening now. Can they put {{TEAM}} under serious pressure? {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 8(14)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Wicket off the first ball for {{BOWLER}}. He can do no wrong today. Lands the offbreak miles outside off stump and thus, {{BATSMAN}} Sharma thinks he can cut that off the back foot, wasn't to be. The ball spins a long way and clatters quickly into middle and leg. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 28(19) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Yorks him! Brilliant riposte from {{BOWLER}}. Nails the yorker with perfection and {{BATSMAN}} who was backing away to make room, had to get his bat down in time. Couldn't due to the pace and precision of the delivery. Timber. DC are keeping a squeeze on this game with some superb planning in the bowling department. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(12) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The sweep has brought about his downfall this time. After crunching the previous two straight to the fielder, {{BATSMAN}} goes for it again but misses it completely. That it was a carrom ball that straightened on off may have had to do with the error. Or it may not have. But it's floored the off stump all right. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 27(21) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! That's a toe-crusher at the base of leg stump. {{BATSMAN}} couldn't get that away with the attempted flick shot, ump raised the finger. Batsman reviewed, but he knew he was a goner. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 7(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by D Kulkarni!! Dhawal Kulkarni dropped a relatively easy one last over, but he's taken a blinder at long-off. He was close to the boundary, had to jump to grab the ball, got the timing right and managed to hold on and also stay inside the rope. {{BATSMAN}} was running back for the second and stood midway in disbelief that the catch was taken. It was a flighted delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} steps out and toe-ends the lofted drive, holes out in the end. So both the set batsmen have been removed in quick succession. {{BATSMAN}} c D Kulkarni b {{BOWLER}} 45(28) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! Top-edge and DK takes it. Was short and quick around off, {{BATSMAN}} tried to pull it but all he could manage is a top edge. DK sprinted back, called for it and took it. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 13(12) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! Axar takes a beauty diving to his right at deep mid-wicket. Googly and {{BATSMAN}} goes with the turn. But this is the first ball he is facing. Not sure what was he thinking. Does not quite time it and hits in the air towards the right of the man in the deep. Axar attacks the ball and dives in time to get his fingers underneath the ball. {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! {{BATSMAN}} looks to up the ante and falls in the process. It's turning out to be another season where {{BATSMAN}} gives it away in the middle and latter half. He spotted the leg-break, made room for the lofted on-drive, didn't quite get hold of the shot, off the inner half of the bat and dragged it down the throat of du Plessis at long-on. A simple catch and the South African holds on. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 21(18) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Goodness me! That is a spectacular catch from MSD. Sheer commitment and his athleticism was on full display while grabbing the catch. Dhoni seemed to have signalled something to {{BOWLER}} just before this delivery and I'm guessing it's something to do with lack of pace. Keeps it in the shortish length area does {{BOWLER}} and induces a thick outside edge on the slog. Dhoni dives full length to his right, juggles it on the first attempt and then takes the rebound with a sharp spring to his right. 150th IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}}! {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Billings!! Terrific catch by Billings! Short delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the pull and miscues it to deep mid-wicket. Billings comes running in and just as the ball is about to die in front of him, he puts in a dive and pulls off a ripper. The wicket belongs to the fielder, more than the bowler. {{BATSMAN}} c Billings b {{BOWLER}} 14(12) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Finch!! In the air, hasn't hit this well and Finch runs around to his left from long-off to take the catch. What a squeeze this is from KXIP. {{BATSMAN}} is distraught and he looks towards the sky. The flatter delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} slices the loft high in the air as the ball spun away from him. He wanted to go over long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Finch b {{BOWLER}} 57(45) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! First blow of the match for Sunrisers. His struggle finally comes to an end. Never looked comfortable at the crease. Throws his hands at an away swinging length ball and ends up chipping it straight to Raina at cover-point. He wont miss those and reverse cups it in that region. Another fine start for the pacer. How often have we seen him doing this? {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 2(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! A smart catch from Axar at backward point and {{BOWLER}} can afford a smile now - much needed wicket for the Capitals - this was short and well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} made room and crunched the cut - didn't keep it down and didn't find the gap, straight to Axar who does well to hold on. {{BATSMAN}} has done his job, but he will be disappointed at having thrown another start away. {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 39(20) [4s-7 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! du Plessis takes a clean catch at long-on and that's the end of Punjab. Reckon, this total is not good enough to take them through to the playoffs. Was a short delivery that was swatted away to long-on by {{BATSMAN}}. du Plessis was the man near the fence who took it and managed to stay inside the boundary. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by M Pandey!! Would you believe it? B-Mac has carved one straight down the throat of sweeper cover, Manish Pandey, the man. Didn't even had to move an inch. Gives himself a lot of room and takes on a 140ks full delivery, smacked it off the meat and for a fleeting moment I thought it was a maximum. Not to be. {{BATSMAN}} c M Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 33(17) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw! {{BATSMAN}}'s been given LBW! He's gone for a review straightaway! Now that the umpire has given it out, I think this is clipping leg. Just a hunch. A full delivery angling into the pads, he's missed a juicy half-volley, attempting a cross-batted flick. Pitching in line, hitting him in line, and clipping the leg-stump. Yep, I was right - not for the first time (wink) - it's the umpire's call taking a toll again as the batting side are left with the consolation prize of a retained review. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 15(11) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! {{BOWLER}} is pulling his team back into the contest once again. He did with the bat earlier, he now has two in an over. This is a huge wicket, KW was the man who could have anchored the chase on this pitch, he's been done in by some extra bounce. Was late in getting forward on the drive, the ball seamed just enough to catch the shoulder of the bat - a bit of glove as well and MS doesn't drop those. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 4(2) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! Third wicket for {{BOWLER}} in a span of 6 balls. He is having a whale of a time at Kotla. The pitch is tailor-made for his style of bowling and he is making full use of it. It was a slower one on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was taken aback by how slowly it came off the deck. He was way too early on the hoick, it comes off the leading edge and Shardul takes a fine catch near deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 51(47) [4s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! {{BOWLER}}'s stretched into double his height with this sideways dive and taken this left-handed inches above the ground. A bit of replays there to ascertain the dismissal but that's out. Kolkata crowd knows it. Arm-ball again that sticks a bit in the pitch, {{BATSMAN}}'s making room down leg and can only tamely pop it back down the pitch. And then {{BOWLER}} takes over. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 49(34) [4s-7 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Vohra!! HUGEEEEE WICKKKETTTT for KXIP. That was a leading edge as the ball held onto the surface for the batsman to not control the whippy pull. The man in the deep - Vohra, this time settles down and takes a smart catch at the edge of the boundary. It almost carried all the way. Pune in trouble now. {{BATSMAN}} c Vohra b {{BOWLER}} 26(27) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! Respite for {{BOWLER}} as he has managed to get rid of Shimron. He was looking for a hat-trick of sixes, but he slogs it straight to Tewatia near the boundary at wide long-on. Was a good catch as he grabbed it with a leap. Got a bit too greedy and has to pay the price for it. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Tewatia b {{BOWLER}} 45(24) [4s-1 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Johnson!! What do you know, he's bowled another short ball and has got the dangerous AB. Massive break for the KKR. Probably it wasn't as short as AB thought. He went back to pull and en{{BATSMAN}}d up skying it off a thick top-edge. Johnson takes it nonchalantly at {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Johnson b {{BOWLER}} 44(23) [4s-1 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! {{BOWLER}} strikes in his first over! A tossed up delivery around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} looks to clear long-on with this loft but finds the fielder stationed near the fence. du Plessis is the man who takes a safe catch. Just like his previous match against CSK, {{BATSMAN}} fails to fire yet again. The bowling change works for Dhoni. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 2(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Similar lines again: wi{{BATSMAN}} of off, CDG thumps it into the air sans any conviction and KP at sweeper cover runs forward to snaffle a dolly of a catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 2(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! Superb catch at the boundary from Stokes, showing great awareness here. It was drilled back hard by {{BATSMAN}}, and Stokes had plenty to do at long-on. Initially, he had to take a brilliant overhead catch while making sure that he times his jump nicely. And then he had to toss the ball back in as his feet were going to encroach the cushions. He judges the situation to a nicety and the execution is spot on. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 48(36) [4s-6 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. {{TEAM}} have been bowled out. Another back of the hand slower one from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} drills the drive to long-off and Choudhary calls him for the second. McCullum gets to the ball and releases it quickly to Karthik, who does the rest. For the first time in IPL, {{TEAM}} have been bowled out in consecutive matches. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Brendon McCullum/Karthik) 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by S Midhun!! Top-edge on the sweep and is taken by the man at deep backward square leg. You live by the sword and you die by it as well. The sweep had been beneficial for him but this time the top-edge was found and was taken by the fielder coming in. Easy take in the end. {{BATSMAN}} c S Midhun b {{BOWLER}} 50(32) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned up with a googly! 88.7kph, lands marginally outside off, spins in quite sharply and {{BATSMAN}} gets into a tangle. He is neither forward nor back to play it. To make matters worse, he is late in bringing in his bat down. The wrong 'un spins past the inside edge to cannon onto the sticks. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! {{BOWLER}}'s got {{BATSMAN}}, or maybe the Mumbai heat has. This is the exact kind of delivery that was disappearing earlier in the night when the Jamaican got stuck into {{BOWLER}}. But after a brief delay where he was attended by the physio, {{BATSMAN}} - even {{BATSMAN}} - fails to find the strength to clear deep midwicket. It's right in the slot for him, but he drags it off the inside half to Krunal Pandya. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 63(36) [4s-3 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! Wide yorker, well in the allowed-zone this time. {{BATSMAN}} stretches, and he knows there's nobody square of the wicket in the deep. All he has to do is clear point. Tries squeezing his steer, but ends up spooning it out to backward point, where Tewatia times his jump superbly, reverse cupping. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Tewatia b {{BOWLER}} 6(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Two wickets in two overs. The bowling change has worked for KKR and GG. The UP lad gets rid of the dangerous {{BATSMAN}}, who makes a start and gets out, again. A full toss that tailed back in, {{BATSMAN}} was beaten for pace as he missed the flick. The ball struck him in front of leg-stump. Not sure if it would have gone on to hit the sticks. But the finger was raised and he walks back. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 28(22) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! Edged and taken! {{BOWLER}} gets the man in form. Swing does the trick once again. Short of a length around off, with a bit of away swing written on it. {{BATSMAN}} tries to fend it down but gets an outside edge and Rahul doesn't make any mistake. Can {{BOWLER}} get one more? {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)J Suchith!! You don't take on the legend of {{BOWLER}} and hope to get away with it. Not even if you are {{BATSMAN}}. What a wicket that is. Could be match winning and a record ending one as well. Look at {{BOWLER}}'s reaction - he raises both arms in triumph and lets out a roar. Slightly short and coming in, pulled straight to deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} didn't get any power behind that. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)J Suchith b {{BOWLER}} 26(14) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Lot of action on that. A scoop landed on the half-volley for the man at deep fine to stop it with his body. Then he gets up, hurls the throw and scores a direct-hit at the striker's end as both batsmen wanted a couple. Irfan gets into the action at a crucial time and has given GL a lifeline. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Irfan Pathan) 1(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! No such luck for {{BATSMAN}}. The short ball is banged in slow. The batsman tried to fetch it from outside off and only manages to sky it up in the air. The man from deep mid - Rahane charges in and takes it easily. Pune need 130 to win! {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 47(38) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Looked a 50-50 call and that's why only {{BOWLER}} went up for it. A slow dipping yorker and {{BATSMAN}} swings blindly without watching the ball, the ball lands in front of him and strikes him on the back leg around leg-stump. Ball-tracking has to be kissing the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 16(17) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mandeep!! {{BOWLER}} has got a big wicket and {{TEAM}}'s team owner Preity Zinta is not happy in the stands. On a slowish pitch, a set batsman has to carry on, but in trying to up the ante and with the thought of taking on the left-arm spinner, {{BATSMAN}} has holed out. It's 39 for 3 and the visitors are in deep trouble. Clever bowling from {{BOWLER}}. He knew that anything full and on the stumps would make it easy for {{BATSMAN}} to target mid-wicket, he bowled this full and wide outside off stump, forced {{BATSMAN}} to fetch and it's a mistimed hit to long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Mandeep b {{BOWLER}} 20(17) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The stumps are a royal mess. 146 clicks this one and it has beaten {{BATSMAN}} for sheer pace. Fired in on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to scoop and saw two of his pegs splattered. {{BOWLER}} jumping and punching the air for joy. End of a very good spell. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 8(5) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! {{BATSMAN}}'s fighting innings comes to an end. Not the most ravishing knock but may be he was given the role of anchoring the innings. It was a slower delivery wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to clear deep mid-wicket, mishits it and Suryakumar takes a dolly at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 43(36) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! Saha yells. Gets no response. Keeps yelling. And the umpire relents. A massive wicket this, and {{BOWLER}} gets himself two in two. Slightly wider this and {{BATSMAN}} looks to search for the turn playing a push away from his body. A faint tickle in the end and has the guilty look in his eyes of looking back. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Huge wicket this. Full marks for GG as well. Bowling a spinner in the 18th over, you don't see that often. The youngster has outfoxed the master finisher. The googly which is short in length, {{BATSMAN}} runs down the wicket and is beaten by the turn, does not get the body behind the line, Uthappa whips the bails off in a flash. {{BOWLER}} loved that wicket. Jumps and follows it with a fist pump. {{BATSMAN}} st Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 23(11) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! What a start for {{BOWLER}}. Gets a faint edge and Dhoni manages to cling on. Flighted delivery pitching on the off stump and spinning away sharply, {{BATSMAN}} tried defending but the feet were stuck in the crease. Dhoni made no mistake and also checked the bails off to be doubly sure about the dismissal as Ro was close with his back foot in the crease. Tough catch because the ball almost shaved the off stump as well. Oh they are checking for the no-ball, Raina blocks the side angle from deep cover, but the other angle shows a very minute portion of the heel to be behind the crease when {{BOWLER}} landed. Third umpire is convinced and it will be OUT. A sluggish start from {{BATSMAN}}, he needs to be a lot more positive as an opener. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 13(18) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mishra!! Cut straight to hand and {{BOWLER}} has three. Nice end to a comprehensive win from DC. Short of a length, {{BATSMAN}} guides and that's catching practice for Mishy. {{BATSMAN}} c Mishra b {{BOWLER}} 12(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! What a massive wicket! Sunrisers are absolutely pumped, with {{BOWLER}} furiously swinging his hand in celebration. Oh, this form. Such a tricky thing. {{BATSMAN}} gets carried away a touch, tries cutting a ball from off-stump and chops it back onto leg. The length wasn't short either, and his balance just wasn't there as he was leaning backward in trying to manufacture the room which wasn't there. This match is well and truly alive. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 8(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja !! Miscued slog-sweep. It's a normal leg-break, but {{BATSMAN}}'s adventures of wanting to smoke this over the longest part of the ground - cow corner - ends up in the hands of the fielder out there. Clearly not full enough to be slogging these .. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 9(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Has that been taken? They've gone upstairs to check, but it looks like a superb grab from Suryakumar. Soft signal is out. Short of length outside off, slower one, {{BATSMAN}} mistimes the cut in front of backward point. Now then, Surya was diving forward there. Did he have his fingers underneath? The ball has bounced into his palm, but did it bounce off the fingertips, or the ground? Tough call with the replays that are available. Soft signal is out, so that may be telling. Or does the third umpire have enough evidence to overrule the soft signal? No he doesn't. OUT on the big screen. {{TEAM}} dugout doesn't look too happy. But based on all evidence and the soft signal on the field, that's probably a fair call. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 38(35) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Dhoni is confident about a stumping. When he's confident, it means he's got his man. Looks like {{BATSMAN}}'s foot is in the air, he did well to drag back in, but couldn't get his feet down. OUT is the call. Excellent work from MS, quick hands did the trick, but that was very well bowled by {{BOWLER}} as well. He slowed down the pace, dragged {{BATSMAN}} forward on the drive and did him in with the turn. {{BATSMAN}} was a long way out of the crease, he did try to drag his foot back in - but comes second best to the Indian keeper. {{BATSMAN}} st Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} attempts a cheeky lap sweep and ends up self-destructing himself. His captain doesn't look too pleased with it. This was tossed up on the leg-stump line, {{BATSMAN}} went a long way across his stumps, bent down and was looking to lap it past the keeper, misses and the ball hits the top of leg-stump. Hushed silence at the Eden Gardens as {{BATSMAN}} walks away. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 26(16) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! {{BATSMAN}} walks. And Mumbai erupt. No need for the review as well. Similar to the last delivery, but a bit wide, {{BATSMAN}} again reached out with his hands with the feet stuck, all he managed was an edge to the keeper. Ishan Kishan makes no mistake and the ploy to send {{BATSMAN}} at 3 has backfired badly. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! A mess of the stumps. The pin-point yorker comes out at full pace and {{BATSMAN}} without bothering to move his feet just jams his bat down. No connection at all. The off-pole is uprooted. Kolkata just not getting the move-on they'd aspired. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! SKY has been really busy in the last few minutes. Full and into the sticks, {{BATSMAN}} actually squeezed that well, but hit it straight to backward point. The fielding show should lift SKY after the run-out today. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik {{BOWLER}}!! The pandya brothers combination doing the trick for Mumbai Indians. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to have a piece of {{BOWLER}}, kneels down and attempts a slog-sweep, doesn't get all of it. Definitely not off the middle, it hovers in the air for a long, long time giving Hardik enough time to run in from deep mid-wicket and hold onto it. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! CSK are pulling things back very nicely, this was a length ball at the pads, {{BATSMAN}} shuffled across and whipped it firmly, hit it in the air and straight down the throat of Kedar at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} is annoyed with himself as he walks back - suddenly, 200 looks very distant now. {{BATSMAN}} c Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 69(47) [4s-4 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tripathi!! {{BATSMAN}} tries to do it with a glory shot but the slower short ball has done him in. Not before he has taken them to the doorsteps of a fine win. The slower ball hung onto the surface, the batsman was early into the slapped pull and managed to get a huge top-edge. The man at long-off back-pedalled and took it close to his chest. {{BATSMAN}} c Tripathi b {{BOWLER}} 87(47) [4s-7 6s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Is {{BATSMAN}} short there at the bowler's end? Yes he is. He was a sloth there, has to pay in the end. Got hurried on the short ball and mistimed the pull to short fine leg. Ishan Kishan wanted the single and set off. {{BATSMAN}} reacted late and despite {{BOWLER}} not being in a good position to collect the throw, he could not make it in the end. Did not even attempt the dive there. Might have lost his bat as well. Will confirm soon. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Mishra/{{BOWLER}}) 8(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Chris Lynn Run Out!! Yes-no and Lynn is gone. Massive wicket for Mumbai. Lynn was looking in good form and {{BATSMAN}} has sold him down the river. Made room to punch the flatter delivery to cover-point, called for a single and took a couple of steps out, then said no and by that time Lynn was more than halfway down the wicket. All Suryakumar had to do was throw the ball to {{BOWLER}} and he did the rest. Lynn is fuming as he walks back. Chris Lynn run out (Suryakumar Yadav/{{BOWLER}}) 21(15) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! {{BATSMAN}} departs for a duck and {{TEAM}} are in a total mess in the Lion's den. {{BATSMAN}} taps it to the off-side and charges for a single, there was no response from Parthiv Patel and {{BATSMAN}} was stranded in the middle. Raina at cover comes quickly and hurls the ball to MS who knocks off the bails. {{BATSMAN}} was nowhere close to coming back. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Raina/Dhoni) 0(2)\n",
            "Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! {{BATSMAN}} gone! Faf judges it perfectly. Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja gets the big wicket. {{TEAM}}'s backbone is back in the hut within 7 overs. {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the wicket, isn't to the pitch and the ball turns a bit as well, the cue-end skies up towards long-off and Faf is right on the edge of the boundary rope. He takes it with his fingers pointing upwards. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja 25(19) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Chopped on! {{BOWLER}} is into the act now. Six down and just the 24 on the board. {{BATSMAN}} becomes the sixth batsmen to record a single-digit score. This is getting embarrassing for DD. Short of a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes half-hearted on the cut shot, the inside edge crashes into the stumps. No respite for the crowd, they keep going bonkers each over. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(15)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} is clean bowled. Seam-up delivery from {{BOWLER}} from a goodish length that snakes in a tad. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't account for it and attempts the drive. The ball sneaks in beating his inside edge and cannons onto the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(10) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Looks to go big on the on-side. Was it needed? He holes out at deep mid-wicket as Kishan gobbles that up. More twist in this gripping contest. That was full and the batsman tried to get undeneath it, but failed to scale substantial distance on it. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 4(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! {{BATSMAN}} is made to sacrifice his wicket. Short ball at the body, {{BATSMAN}} takes his eyes off as he aims to pull, the ball hits him on the shoulder and drops down, Mandeep races to the other end and {{BATSMAN}} just crosses him to ensure he's out. {{BOWLER}} does the easy part of collecting the ball, walking back and removing one bail. {{BATSMAN}} run out ({{BOWLER}}) 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pooran!! {{BOWLER}} has got Jos {{BATSMAN}} as his maiden IPL wicket. What a moment for the 20-year-old left-arm seamer. He's deceived him with the off-cutter here. It was slanted across well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} - almost premeditatedly - wanted to slug it through midwicket but goes through with it too early. Went up off the toe-end and the keeper Pooran took a fine catch running back towards fine leg. Big celebrations from Punjab, particularly Ashwin. {{BATSMAN}} c Pooran b {{BOWLER}} 23(17) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Gives away his cards early with a charge down the pitch, which {{BOWLER}} pulls his length back to and makes sure {{BATSMAN}} never gets there and finds himself stuck half way down. That sums up {{TEAM}} tonight: Stuck cluelessly half way down with no chance of return. {{BATSMAN}} st de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 9(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! Edges. And {{TEAM}} are happy to get generous with their wickets. They aren't doing a CSK. So {{BATSMAN}} backs away in trying to slap this over the covers, but {{BOWLER}} - with yet another cutter - gets it well across, taking the outside-edge and down the keeper's throat. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 16(20) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stoinis!! He's hit this one well. Oh, hold on. Not quite. Does not bother to step down, just goes with the swing, ends up miscuing it and holes out to long-off. Two quick wickets and Gujarat's chase is in danger of going awry. {{BATSMAN}} c Stoinis b {{BOWLER}} 4(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! {{BATSMAN}} had to go for the big shot and unfortunately for {{TEAM}}, he loses balance as one hand comes off the bat. Hits the slog flat and DJ Bravo times his jump to perfection at wide long-on to gobble the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Bravo b {{BOWLER}} 38(25) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! {{BATSMAN}} gone. This was always on the cards. The short of length delivery has caused problems for {{BATSMAN}} and he succumbs to it. {{BOWLER}} angled it into the left-hander and {{BATSMAN}} went through with the flat-batted pull, high on the bat and a skier to mid-on. Krunal steadies himself under the night sky and pouches it calmly. Perfect start for MI and not so for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 4(2) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! The slower ball and that lands a wicket. The ball holds up thanks to knuckle ball and the lifted hit finds the bowler's hands. The bowler called for it and takes it. He charged out and tried to go aerial but never timed it. Watson's dot ball a reason for this? Might well be. {{TEAM}} are off to the worst possible start. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 10(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Gopal!! {{BOWLER}} roaring back into this game in some style. Bowls the slower ball and hits the pitch hard while doing so, it sat up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} outside off but lack of pace means he had to power it really hard off the middle. {{BATSMAN}} seemed to have found the middle but couldn't manage the desired distance as Gopal takes a fine running catch at long-on (to his left). {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Gopal b {{BOWLER}} 9(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} is bowling a fine spell today. Gets the dangerous batsman, the highest run getter of {{TEAM}} with this peach of a delivery. It's the offie that does the trick. {{BATSMAN}} waited for it and tried to run it down but the ball spins in sharply, flicks his pads and takes down the sticks. Second scalp of the match for Sunil {{BOWLER}} and the crowd at Eden erupts in joy. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 21(17) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Cutting!! Another slower ball and {{BATSMAN}} is gone. Was down the track to hit it over long-on but skewed it off the base of the bat. Easy take for Cutting. The MI dugout erupt after that wicket. Turning out to be a top, top last over this. {{BATSMAN}} c Cutting b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Loopy leggie and the batsman is stumped. Jumped out of the crease and tried to go aerial on the off-side but missed it by a mile. Beaten in flight and the rest was done by the keeper. {{TEAM}} are messing up the chase here. Third wicket for {{BOWLER}}. The ball dipped on him and the preempted movement deserted him. {{BATSMAN}} st Klaasen b {{BOWLER}} 3(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! Done in by the off-cutter. {{BATSMAN}} tries flicking it through mid-wicket, but there was enough cut on the ball to take a thick outside edge. Good take from Buttler diving forward, should help his bruised confidence. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 3(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Grandhomme at long-off!!.. and {{BOWLER}} strikes with his first ball. This was tossed up nicely outside off, right in {{BATSMAN}}'s hitting zone, he took up the bait and was looking to cream it back over the bowler's head. The bat turned in his hands at the point of impact, he ended up slicing it high and towards long-off. de Grandhomme completes a fine catch. He had to make sure that he didn't step onto the ropes as he completed the catch - which he did. Relief for RCB and Chinnaswamy finds its voice back. {{BATSMAN}} c de Grandhomme b {{BOWLER}} 27(19) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by A Russell!! {{BATSMAN}} departs. This was on the cards. He slogged from ball one and perishes. Chips down the track to smash the offie over deep mid-wicket. No timing whatsoever - courtesy the bat turned at the point of impact. Russell runs to his left from mid-wicket and pouches it with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c A Russell b {{BOWLER}} 7(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! Ah, this is more conventional and straightforward. Bowls a pacy short ball and keeps it straight on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} came charging down the pitch and the extra bounce was always going to create trouble. As expected, the short ball got slightly big on him and he feathered a thin edge straight to Samson behind the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 5(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! A big shout for lbw as {{BATSMAN}} is struck on the pad. Not given. {{BOWLER}} persuades Dhoni to go for the review! Legal ball. It was the googly and {{BATSMAN}} was pressing forward for the push. Is the impact outside off? Before that, was there an inside edge? Yes, confirmed by UltraEdge. The ball brushed the pad and carried to first slip. A review for lbw, given out caught! Got to give credit to {{BOWLER}} here. He forced MS to go upstairs and it's a successful one. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Dragged on! Lands on the seam and gets the ball to angle away from Yuvi; making him fetch that far from his reach. Yuvi with his laden-feet went through with the pull and chopped it back onto his stumps, off the thick inside edge firing off the PUMA sticker. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! Charges out, looks to loft the slower ball away and top-edges it for the keeper to run towards the short fine area and take it. This again won't please the skipper. QDK had his eyes on the ball and took it nicely despite the ball going away from him. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! {{BATSMAN}} has been strangled down the leg-side. The hometown lad doesn't cause much damage. Short and down leg, would have been a wide had {{BATSMAN}} let it pass, instead he sees a run-scoring opportunity, gets inside the line and gloves it to Parthiv. This time he had the bowler and umpire on his side. Third wicket down and DD are in deep trouble. This was a nothing delivery from {{BOWLER}} and it still produced a wicket. Tells you that the rub of the green is with MI. {{BATSMAN}} c Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 6(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Smith!! Catching practice for Smith. {{BOWLER}} opts for the googly, finishes around the leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't control the flick, hits it straight to mid-wicket. RPS would want to wrap this up quickly and boost their net run rate. {{BATSMAN}} c Smith b {{BOWLER}} 5(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by K Paul!! Mistimed pull, in the air and it's a very good catch by Keemo Paul running forward and diving low at deep square leg. Short ball, Faf tried to take the bowler on, the ball caught him high on the bat. End of a fine innings. Faf's counter-attack in the powerplay was very crucial with Watto taking his time at the other end. {{BATSMAN}} c K Paul b {{BOWLER}} 50(39) [4s-7 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Williamson!! Mayank in the balcony cannot believe this, has his hands on the head. Meanwhile, {{BATSMAN}} looks towards the heaven and starts walking back to the pavilion in disappointment. Was down on his knee to play the sweep that induced a top-edge and flew straight to Kane Williamson at deep square leg. He's not going to miss out on those. Good comeback by {{BOWLER}} as he gets a huge wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Williamson b {{BOWLER}} 11(16)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! A direct-hit by Buttler and {{BATSMAN}} has to depart. He failed to dig out the yorker and tried to sneak in a bye. Before he could turn back and get into the crease Buttler had done his job. The batsman had given up! {{BATSMAN}} run out (Buttler) 27(22) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! A smash back. And the perish. Patel smartly keeps denying {{BATSMAN}} the opportunity to go through the on-side by firing it wide outside off. Gets the bat up flat on the slap down the ground. Too early once again and all he manages is the cue end that flies back to the upward palms of Patel. So the change in bats not quite what the side wanted at this point. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 50(32) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!!Edged and gone. Nothing great about this delivery. A wide delivery outside off that was there to be punished. The cut shot was on and {{BATSMAN}} goes for it. All he manages is a faint top edge that is pocketed by the keeper. Kohli should be a relieved man. {{BATSMAN}} c Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 37(28) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! Whatta catch that! Eye-candy that take was. Was a short delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} rocked back and pulled it hard to deep mid-wicket where Stokes timed his jump and he was in the air as he reverse cupped it. Probably one of the best catches of the season. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 4(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! This man makes it look so easy. With the sunglasses and the floppy hat on he takes a high catch and makes it look ridiculously easy. Flat-batted high into the sky as {{BOWLER}} bowled it short, when the ball is anywhere near Pollard, he is expected to take it and he does so, running around to his left, keeping himself inside the playing area. {{BOWLER}} on a hat-trick now. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 28(22) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Beaten on the edge, and more brilliant glovework from Dhoni behind the stumps. He's not got him, has he? Oh dear, {{BATSMAN}}'s back foot is in the air slightly when the bails are taken off. He's gone. Another brilliant delivery from {{BOWLER}}. Flat through the air, still manages a good deal of turn from a length. Delhi crumbling. {{BATSMAN}} st Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 44(31) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Review off the last ball. Would you believe it? It is {{BOWLER}} who has asked Kohli for it. Has {{BATSMAN}} got outside the line? The original call was not out. Hawk-Eye in and it shows that {{BATSMAN}} hasn't got outside the line. Three reds and gone. Cheeky from {{BATSMAN}}, tried to reverse-sweep a full ball on off, missed and once he didn't get bat on that he was dead. Strong final over from {{BOWLER}} and RCB. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Oh yeah, Robbie will be a relieved man! His prayers have worked, and the dropped catch hasn't cost much. {{BOWLER}} sticks to his slower ones and he has managed to knock down {{BATSMAN}}. Rolled his fingers, pitched this one on a good length. {{BATSMAN}} like always, swings and misses. Failed to get him in his previous over, but has managed to get his man eventually. First wicket for {{BOWLER}} this season. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 15(14) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! Buttler is having a field day with his catching. This is a dolly though. Was a low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} couldn't quite get the desired distance on the loft. Skewed it more off the toe-end and it went flat to long-off where Buttler made no mistake. Hardik Pandya has got back on strike though as the batsmen crossed and that's a positive for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 5(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by U Yadav!! {{BOWLER}} gets {{BATSMAN}}. Good bowling. Bowled the cutter outside off, made {{BATSMAN}} fetch the slog and he cannot clear backward square. Last over he managed a boundary, not this time. {{BATSMAN}} c U Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 35(32) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. That was superb from Pollard. A bullet of a throw from {{BATSMAN}}ep long-on and has found ABD short. {{BATSMAN}} slogged it away towards the long-on area and wanted to come back for a second only for him to sent back by Aksh{{BATSMAN}}ep Nath. ABD tried to turn back but the direct hit found him short. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Pollard) 75(51) [4s-6 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! {{BOWLER}} has his revenge instantly! After the last boundary, I was beginning to think that RR have missed a trick by giving {{BOWLER}} the new ball, again, with {{BATSMAN}} on strike. But hasn't the off spinner justified the decision or what! Clever bowling, expected {{BATSMAN}} to give the charge and hung it up in the air a touch more on a slightly shorter length. The West Indian didn't bother adjusting to the length, that's not his way anyway and goes through with the shot. A bit of grip off the surface and whizzes past the edge. Easy for Klaasen. {{BATSMAN}} st Klaasen b {{BOWLER}} 4(2) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! {{BATSMAN}} is waiting. Not sure why? They are checking whether Karthik has the ball in his gloves, he does. It pops out after the stumps are broken. So that is fine. TV umpire is having multiple looks. Why is he taking so much time? The square leg umpire had raised the finger and just because {{BATSMAN}} stood his ground, the umpires went upstairs. Finally, we have a decision and it is OUT. The Eden crowd had to wait for almost three minutes to start their celebration. The googly and {{BATSMAN}} hung back to nudge it into the on-side, gets an inside edge onto the under side of the thigh pad and the ball rolls back towards Karthik, {{BATSMAN}} was taking off for the run and by the time he saw where the ball was, DK had broken the stumps. The ball did slip out of his grasp, but that was after he had lit the LEDs. {{BATSMAN}} st Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 35(27) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! A waste. A sheer waste. A nothing line this from {{BOWLER}}, down leg and {{BATSMAN}} helps it out to short fine courtesy his clip. Nothing wrong with that. Just that he wants the single desperately after that - something Rahane declines making him return from his adventures half way down the track. A direct hit and you do not need to disturb the third umpire for these. Had given up. Oh what a waste of form. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Bipul Sharma) 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! The centurion in the previous game is gone! A 134.1kph fullish ball outside off and {{BATSMAN}} threw his bat at it. The bottom hand comes off the handle and hence the miscue. Raina takes a sharp catch bending forward, but {{BATSMAN}} stands his ground. The on-field umpires send it upstairs with OUT being the soft decision. An easy one for the TV umpire as Raina had both his palms underneath the ball. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 8(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! The Royals are in a shambles at the moment - a nothing shot from {{BATSMAN}} and {{BOWLER}} has his third wicket of the day. He shortened his length and angled this one across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}}'s feet went nowhere as he looked to guide it towards the off-side, hung his bat out and the edge carried nicely through to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 8(3) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! Huge wicket! Massive blow for Mumbai as the well-set {{BATSMAN}} has to depart. Have to say that this was a result of the slow scoring by Lewis and Kishan at the other end. Slower ball and the length is dragged back as well, {{BATSMAN}} went for the slog but only managed to sky it high in the air. Rahul was quick to call for it and trekked back nicely to sit under it. High pressure catch and it's been taken. Mumbai in a spot of bother here. They need their skipper to take charge. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 57(42) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gowtham!! {{BOWLER}} was bowling beautifully and this was always on the cards. It was a flighted delivery at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} went for a wild swing against the turn, he ends up mistiming it high in the air, long-off comes under it and takes it easily. Punjab are in real trouble now. {{BATSMAN}} c Gowtham b {{BOWLER}} 9(13) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Billings!! Is that the game for DD? The in-form {{BATSMAN}} is gone for a duck. Too much pressure really. He had to tee off from the word go with the required rate touching 13, and {{BOWLER}} isn't the most straightforward bloke to take on first up. He cleverly bowls it a little wide of off forcing {{BATSMAN}} to reach out for his slog-sweep and it comes right off the bottom. It's a top-edge too. Simple catch for Billings at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Billings b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by T Natarajan!! He tried to save his team-mates, and in the end perishes. Didn't take singles off the previous two balls, sees the ball on the shorter side and goes after it with a cut shot. Isn't in control of it and offers a dolly to Natarajan at backward point. With that goes {{TEAM}}'s hopes! {{BATSMAN}} c T Natarajan b {{BOWLER}} 77(37) [4s-5 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! Slower ball again and {{BATSMAN}} holes out to long-on. Clears his front leg and looks to tonk it into the stands, doesn't get the distance, off the cue end of the bat and straight into the ever-safe hands of KP. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! Pollard under a high-ball, you expect only one result. A fine hand from {{BATSMAN}} ends. Deserved a fifty. Smart bowling from {{BOWLER}}, his second and making the most of the opportunity. He saw the batsman advance and threw it wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} had to reach out for the loft and he miscues it towards long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 45(31) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! Dot followed by a wicket. Stokes with another catch. He's been everywhere today. The slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} picked it early this time around, went with the angle towards deep square leg. Made a decent connection as well but the big side boundaries don't fetch him a six. Stokes steadies himself near deep square leg and pouches it with ease. {{BOWLER}} has a smile on his face. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 8(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Krunal Pandya Run Out!! That was a yorker, tailed back in, hit the boot and lobbed away to point. Jadeja roared in, missiled in the throw and found the dive from Krunal Pandya short. A full length pool dive also doesn't do it. The third umpire saw one replay to give his verdict. Fourth direct hit. All southpaws. They have fielded a lifeline for themselves. Krunal Pandya run out (Jadeja) 29(20) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Thomas!! Another soft dismissal and another instance of an {{TEAM}} batsman throwing his wicket away. {{BATSMAN}} tried to be cheeky and walked across his stumps to lap it over the fielder at 45. But unfortunately, he ended up hitting it straight to Thomas, who accepts it with glee. PP can't believe it, couldn't have placed it any better. {{BATSMAN}} c Thomas b {{BOWLER}} 8(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! You just can't keep Stokes out of the action. Second wicket in the over for {{BOWLER}} and he might have just won RPS the game. Another one of his cutters outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went for the loft over long-off, since the ball gripped the surface it took the outer half of the bat and skied towards sweeper cover. Stokes made no mistake. Bit of silence around the ground now. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 9(9) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Obstructing the field!! This is drama. Some thriller novel will struggle to match up to this. {{BATSMAN}} ran completely in the middle of the turf and the throw hit him. SRH first went up for a caught-behind call and then for obstructing the field. {{BATSMAN}} obs 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rayudu!! {{BOWLER}} takes off on his celebratory run. Fullish delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} lofts looking for a six, targetted the long-off region, but Rayudu was stationed perfectly under it. He was very close to the rope, but did exceedingly well to balance himself just inside the boundary. Umps check with the third umpire with the soft signal being OUT, replays confirmed it was a clean catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Rayudu b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Gone this time. Headless batting from {{BATSMAN}}? Rush of blood? Preempts the lofted swing and smashes it as hard as he can, puts all his body power behind it after clearing the front leg. Manish Pandey sets himself up at long-on and judges it to perfection. Taken inches inside the rope. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 8(4) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Caught off a high full toss, they are checking but it's just below the waist and a legal delivery. When it's not your day even the full toss go to fielders. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to smash over mid-wicket, miscued it high and actually a good grab running back from backward point over his right shoulder.{{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 7(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! Reminiscent of Sarfaraz {{BOWLER}}'s dismissal against KXIP. Neatly guided down to lone slip. KP hung back to this legbreak and was wanting to glide the ball past the slip, the ball arrives much quicker and lobs low off the splice off the bat. Five down {{TEAM}}. Well judged catch from SD considering the pace and height on that. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 9(6) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} wasn't timing it at all and this was always on the cards. It was a good length delivery at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to play it across the line, his willow misses it totally and ball disturbs the furniture. Punjab are off to a dream start here. The ball just brushes the off stick. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Superb over by {{BOWLER}}! Claims his third wicket of the over as {{BATSMAN}} perishes for a golden duck. A short ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} tries to scoop it over the keeper but all he can manage is a feather to it. Pant leaps, gets his glove to it initially and takes it on the second attempt. All of sudden, there is pin drop silence at the stadium. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Lock, stock and two smoking barrels. You-miss-I-Hit stuff from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}}'s form seems to be like that mythical creature which just cannot be found. Rifled fast, coming in with the arm. {{BATSMAN}} lined up for a heave across the line, fails to counter for the drift. The ball snakes in and clatters the stumps. DD in strife now. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! Rohit takes the catch and signals to the umpire to check upstairs. He is not sure. Soft signal is out. Good low catch at mid-wicket by Rohit. Slugged by {{BATSMAN}} and taken near his bootlaces. Looks like the fingers are un{{BATSMAN}}r the ball. Let's wait for the third umpire's call. Who is having a look from different angles. Should be given out I guess. OUT it is. {{BOWLER}} strikes and the pressure has told on {{BATSMAN}}. He was struggling and has ma{{BATSMAN}} his way back. Didn't get enough elevation on this hit. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 7(13) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! {{BOWLER}} is behind what happened earlier in the day and he is trying his best to change things on his own. Short ball that kicked off and beat the pull of {{BATSMAN}}, took the top edge en route to the keeper. Two wickets in the over and Punjab might feel resurrected after this. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 2(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! Number one down. Kotla goes silent. {{BATSMAN}}'s failure continues. What was he trying to do there? Awful really. Redemption for {{BOWLER}}. Banged it short and it shooted up awkwardly at {{BATSMAN}}. He was caught in two minds there. Initially, wanted to leave but then sees it as a scoring opportunity. Arches his back belatedly and tries it periscope it over the keeper. Too late. The ball catches a faint edge and carries to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 12(11) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sachin Baby!! Some normalcy restored. And as always is the case, it is spin that gets on that duty. {{BOWLER}} doesn't mind giving it some air inviting the big swing. And gets just that. A full-blooded tonk down and skewed away. Almost teases Baby at the long-off fence with this one threatening to fly over, before the bucket hands facing upwards come to the rescue in plucking it out. They're checking the foot's behaviour - just inside the permissable limits. {{BATSMAN}} c Sachin Baby b {{BOWLER}} 52(37) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Miller Run Out!! 1 run completed. Appeal for a run-out at the bowler's end, Miller dived, has it saved him? A flat throw and a good pick-up. No, the dive's not good enough and Miller falls for a diamond duck on his Royals debut. Unfortunate way to get dismissed - it didn't help that Miller lost his bat as well, could have saved him else. On a length and at the stumps, worked in front of square on the on-side and it was {{BATSMAN}}'s call for the second. Miller responded well, but lost his bat as he dived - good throw from Gaikwad and Kedar was at hand to break the stumps. Miller run out (Ruturaj Gaikwad/Kedar Jadhav) 0(0)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! And gone! Rajasthan have their man. {{BATSMAN}} cannot believe it as he walks back with both his hand along with the bat over his head. {{TEAM}} in trouble now with half the side back in the dugout. There was a plan and {{BOWLER}} has bowled to it. Third man was up, deep backward point was in place and a deep extra cover. {{BOWLER}} went for the wide yorker and even nailed it, {{BATSMAN}} bends down and slices it straight to Unadkat at deep backward point. That was right off the meat but the long boundaries did not help him there. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 24(14) [6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by R Tripathi!! Finally, a wicket for RR! Some respite from the carnage but it's not the man they would have wanted although {{BATSMAN}} also was striking them really well. Slower ball from {{BOWLER}} and the length is a touch shorter, the DD captain wanted to launch down the ground but only got height on this one. Went up to the night sky for ages towards long-off where Tripathi held his nerve to settle under it. Another fine knock from the skipper, he's set it up nicely for DD to score a really imposing total. {{BATSMAN}} c R Tripathi b {{BOWLER}} 50(35) [4s-3 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Vinay Kumar!! The cramp derailed him of the momentum. He was really struggling. Limps off to a quiet stadium. The delivery was short alright and {{BATSMAN}} picked the length early, but his feet could not make the adjustment to rock back and the pull was off the top-edge, Vinay ran across to his left from long-on and completed a straightforward catch. Might be a good thing for {{TEAM}} as {{BATSMAN}} was not able to run as well and we know that Dhoni needs someone to sprint along with him. {{BATSMAN}} c Vinay Kumar b {{BOWLER}} 14(12) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Misses the sweep and the finger goes up! 97-run win for KXIP. Woah! Thats massive. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} is not walking. He's not pleased with the decision. Has some choice words to say to umpire Nandan. \"That's an absolute shocker,\" says KP on air and he's right. Massive inside edge onto the pad. Two poor decisions in two overs might have just cost {{TEAM}} the game. The off-break which turns back in and cramps {{BATSMAN}} for room, he hurriedly brings his bat down and smashes it into his pads. The umpire didn't spot it and gave it out after a thought. {{BATSMAN}} was fuming after the decision. Even showed his bat to the umpire gesturing he hit it. But you can't overturn an onfield decision unless you have the DRS and that is not available in the IPL. This wicket has to be the game changing moment. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 2(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Edged and into the hands of Pant. Is that the game for DC? Death bowling is all about watching what the batsman does. Faf was backing away, so KG fired this short of length delivery wide of off and forced him to fetch, Faf tried to reach but only managed to kiss it to Pant as he overbalanced playing the shot. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 43(35) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nair!! A wicket to cap off the innings. Fourth scalp for {{BOWLER}} - who's had a field day with the ball. Lands the knuckle ball on a fuller length at the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} had to go for it and lifted it high. Straight into the gullet of Nair at long-on. Catching has been really good from Punjab today. {{BATSMAN}} c Nair b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Delhi Capitals inch closer to booking a place in the play-offs. {{BOWLER}} bowls a slower delivery on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} looks to go big and gets deceived due to the slower delivery. Mistimes his loft to long-on and Iyer completes the formalities. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Full marks to the bowler there. He was sure that the batsman had nicked it and {{BATSMAN}} has to walk back for a golden duck. Short delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} tries to run it down to third man but gets a slight feather on its way to the keeper. Even he wasn't sure that if had nicked it. UltraEdge confirms with a spike! {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Soft, soft dismissal! {{BOWLER}} is on a roll here! It's {{BATSMAN}} who has to go and another massive blow to {{TEAM}}. This was tossed up generously and perhaps held onto the pitch a tad. {{BATSMAN}} didn't help his cause by trying to work across the line. The leading edge balloons towards {{BOWLER}} who just has to leap a touch from his tall frame to grab the return catch. The hosts have been jolted here at Eden Gardens. It's all happening. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 3(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! That's a gift from {{BATSMAN}} and Manish takes it with glee - a low full-toss from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} backed away as he looked to clear the infield - doesn't get hold of the shot and pops it straight to cover. Not the start {{TEAM}} wanted - their little pocket dynamo falls early. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 11(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The leg-bail flies off its groove and that's the game for Delhi. Massive win. {{BOWLER}} causes Patel to go through with the slog too early as he holds it back in pace and the deception is good enough to fetch him his third for the night. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 44(29) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Cutting!! {{BATSMAN}} goes now. Off-pace slower delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands a foot outside off and then slugs this high up in the air, Cutting at deep mid actually misjudged it for an instant or two, but recovers to take it over his head and then tumbles over. Made a simple catch look difficult. {{BATSMAN}} c Cutting b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ingram!! The extra ball has got the Capitals another wicket - AB was been done in by his fellow countryman - the slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, think AB spotted it as he looked to go back over the bowler's head - didn't get hold of the shot as much as he would have liked - was in the air for a long time and a third South African - Colin Ingram - completes the catch even as he ran back from mid-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Ingram b {{BOWLER}} 17(16) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Very loose shot, especially with a slip in place. He's trying to steer this back of length delivery with an open face down to third man. All he does is poke it off the outside edge to Ishan Kishan. {{TEAM}} going down in a heap. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 5(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! {{BOWLER}} strikes as Manish Pandey takes a skier. No special knock by the Universe Boss tonight. Goes hard at a length delivery and gets a top-edge that goes miles up in the air. Manish at point settles under it and takes it, not on the first but on the second attempt. The ball almost popped out of Manish's hands who did well to cling on the catch eventually. Sunrisers on top! {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 4(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Nabi Run Out!! That's a fine effort by {{BOWLER}} as he's ran Nabi out. {{BATSMAN}} had smashed the short ball back to the bowler and {{BOWLER}} stops it with his right hand. Nabi was backing away and he was miles outside his crease. {{BOWLER}} parries the ball on to the stumps and the Afghan all-rounder is gone. Nabi run out ({{BOWLER}}) 12(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Superb bowling! Slower bouncer from {{BOWLER}}, kept it wide outside off and that meant {{BATSMAN}} had to really fetch it on the pull. He is clearly foxed by the variation, and one hand coming off during the shot execution doesn't help either. Straight down the throat of deep square leg. Brilliant cricket from MI. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 25(15) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}}'s painful stay at the crease has ended through a full toss. {{BOWLER}} gets some tail on the delivery and swirls it in on middle, and {{BATSMAN}} plays all around it. His head fell over too. The ball crashes into the back leg on the full. Just one of those days for {{BATSMAN}}. Never found any timing whatsoever. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 24(28) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik {{BOWLER}}!! Oh that's a stunning grab from brother Hardik. Unbelievable. The catch of the tournament so far. This is exactly what Markande should have done in the previous over. Turn it away outside off stump like {{BOWLER}} did this time. {{BATSMAN}} tries to go for a big hit, but the bat turns in his hands on impact with the ball and it's a slice that flies more towards deep extra-cover. But Hardik put his skating boots on, got there and flew full length to his left and took it with both hands horizontal to the ground. Just amazing! {{BOWLER}} has given a lot of hope for MI with 2 wickets in 8 balls. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 13(6) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned up. {{BATSMAN}} is hoodwinked by {{BOWLER}}'s googly. He was strugging to pick earlier as well. Credit to DK for bringing back the leggie. KKR draw first blood. It was dropped a tad shorter - the googly - {{BATSMAN}} stayed back, waiting for the leggie perhaps. The ball spun back in, goes through the bat-pad gate and crashes the stumps. The South African skipper is absolutely clueless. Eden Gardens roars. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 27(15) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Whatta comeback from {{BOWLER}}. After being clobbered for two sixes, he has come back with the vital wicket of {{BATSMAN}}. It was a leggie which spins into {{BATSMAN}}, he wanted to work it to the leg-side, plays down the wrong line. It misses his edge and raps him on the pads. It looked close and umpire gave him out instantly. Rishabh challenged the decision but was proved wrong within minutes. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 7(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has his first IPL wicket and that's a big one as well. {{BATSMAN}} was looking in good touch, decides to up the ante and instead has to walk back to the hut. Short of a length and on the stumps, wasn't short enough for the pull, {{BATSMAN}} went through with the shot, connected with thin air and the ball clattered into the top of middle. RCB are beginning to boss this match now, can {{TEAM}} find an answer? {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 29(26) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Edged and caught! Shardul can buy a lottery ticket today - this was a cross-seam delivery that was short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes lit up as he saw the width, went hard on the cut and only managed a thick audible edge. Straight through to MS and young {{BATSMAN}} walks. Six down and the Royals are struggling to set a competitive score. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 16(14) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Look at {{BOWLER}}. He is hardly this pumped. Knows he's got the big man. {{BATSMAN}} makes room, tries to cut, but the ball is not that short. On top of that it's a seam up ball that skids through and uproots the off-stump. Crowd goes mental. Little window that Mumbai needed, have they got that? We shall see. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 47(21) [4s-2 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Maxwell Run Out!! Can you believe it? Maxwell has been run out, what an unfortunate way to get out. Nothing's going right for Maxwell this year. Was a full length delivery around off and {{BATSMAN}} drove it straight back to the bowler. {{BOWLER}} in his followthrough got his hand to it and parried it on to the stumps at the bowler's end. Maxwell is well short of the crease and he has to walk back. Got to feel for the Aussie batsman! Maxwell run out ({{BOWLER}}) 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! {{BATSMAN}} picks out Rahane at long-off. Trimmed the pace and kept it wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} went hard at it and ended up mistiming it to Royals' captain. {{BATSMAN}} scratchy knock comes to an end. It came off the toe-end, hence lacked the timing. Also, lack of pace meant that he had to generate some power but the southpaw failed on that occasion. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 12(14) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, loud shout for LBW and {{TEAM}} want a review. Kohli looked very keen to challenge the call. It's a fair delivery from {{BOWLER}}, it has pitched in line, but is it spinning down leg? There's no bat and Ultraedge confirms it. I don't think it straightened enough, Hawk-Eye in and it's missing the leg-stump. {{TEAM}} have lost their review. This was tossed up on middle and was spinning into the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} swept and missed, was struck on the pads, in front of leg and the angle was traking it down the leg-stump. The ball rolls away towards the off-side, the fielder has a shy at the bowler's end and concedes an overthrow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Huge wicket in the context of the game. Back of a length, angling into the hip, SKY's eyes lit up on seeing the short ball in that channel and he fell back onto his favourite shot in the cricket dictionary - the whip pull. Hit it too good and looped up in the air for deep square to take a straightforward catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Rashid Khan b {{BOWLER}} 34(38) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! {{TEAM}} are falling apart here. A short ball at 130.5kph - the off-cutter, {{BATSMAN}} didn't pick it and was early into his shot - the pull/heave. Got it off the cue end. Unadkat ran in from deep backward square leg and took a sharp low catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 8(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! {{BOWLER}} has another! He's bowled exceptionally well today and has started this spell with a bang as well. {{BATSMAN}} was moving around the crease and {{BOWLER}} smartly dragged this wider outside off. Asked the Englishman to fetch it and he could only slice it high in the air. Easiest of catches for Samson at backward point. Decent start to the IPL for {{BATSMAN}} but he would have wanted to kick on and make a really big one. Timely strike for RR because this partnership was starting to open up. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 45(39) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. You've gotta be kidding me! Full ball nurdled away towards deep mid-wicket, Rashid (who can't be kept out of the game) fires in the throw at the keeper's end. {{BATSMAN}}, who slipped at the non-striker's end, ran to the danger end (the striker's end) for the fatal second run and was caught just marginally short. Throws his bat in disgust as he walks back, embarrassed. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Rashid Khan/Saha) 22(16) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Cutting!! Andre Gomes hangs on. Cutting if you are confused. No power on the slog-sweep by {{BATSMAN}}, knelt down to slog it, but found deep mid to a nicety. {{BOWLER}} held back the length a little and got his man. Looked a tired shot to me. {{BATSMAN}} c Cutting b {{BOWLER}} 46(35) [4s-2 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} has struck gold in his first over! This was pushed through flatter and quicker, the wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} was down on his knees as he went for the sweep and missed, struck pretty adjacent to the stumps and it's an easy call for the umpire. The impact was in front of middle, would have been going on and hitting the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 5(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shivam Mavi!! {{BATSMAN}} couldn't have picked the fielder out any better. He knows, can't believe his luck. Punches his bat in anger. {{BOWLER}} provides the breakthrough for KKR. Landed short and asked {{BATSMAN}} to go for it. Watto rocked back and smoked it flat, forgets there is a fielder set for the trap. Hits it straight to Mavi, who takes it at the edge of the bounce. Didn't have to move an inch. Like Faf, Watto also fails to convert his start into a big-score. {{BATSMAN}} c Shivam Mavi b {{BOWLER}} 36(25) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shaun Marsh!! And he is gone. Wrong 'un does the trick. It is a little bemusing to see why did {{BATSMAN}} go for the big hit instead of Chris Lynn! The boundaries were not coming for a while now and {{BATSMAN}} departs trying to up the ante. Slogs and gets the height on it. Not quite the distance he wanted. Marsh settles under it at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Shaun Marsh b {{BOWLER}} 8(18)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Finch!! And {{BOWLER}} has a wicket. {{BATSMAN}} had to keep going. This time he picks out the fielder. Or rather Finch got to the ball. Dug in short and there was not much pace on the ball, {{BATSMAN}} pulls it in front of square, Finch runs a long way from long-on to his left, keeps his eyes on the ball and takes it with both hands while on the move. Excellent catch that. A handy knock from {{BATSMAN}} ends. {{BATSMAN}} c Finch b {{BOWLER}} 34(17) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Another twist. That ideal ball in the times of misery. Full, straight, bang in the blockhole. {{BATSMAN}} backs away, gives himself some room to go downtown. Misses. Big time. And the ball sneaks under to make a mess of the timber. And they take the time-out. The only strategy RCb need now is to find ways of giving AB his strike. And his century. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 15(13) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Brilliant bowling. Turning out to be a great final over so far. He's varied it up nicely, so as to not become predictable. This one's almost in the blockhole and it's tailing in at a good pace. Slips under {{BATSMAN}}'s slog and crashes into the stumps off the pad. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 54(51) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! Two wickets within a span of four balls. {{BOWLER}} sports a bright smile. A pacy short of length delivery slanted across the left-handed batsman, {{BATSMAN}} tries to fetch it from outside off and heave over the leg-side. The edge flies and settles into the safe hands of Bravo at third man. And, of course, the jig follows it. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Bravo b {{BOWLER}} 38(26) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! {{BATSMAN}} is made to sacrifice his wicket. Short ball at the body, {{BATSMAN}} takes his eyes off as he aims to pull, the ball hits him on the shoulder and drops down, Mandeep races to the other end and {{BATSMAN}} just crosses him to ensure he's out. {{BOWLER}} does the easy part of collecting the ball, walking back and removing one bail. {{BATSMAN}} run out ({{BOWLER}}) 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! Oh dear. This is a collapse of enormous magnitudes. Faster than some of the vehicles that line up in the evenings on the Bangalore roads. Goes for the slower one on a length outside off. {{BATSMAN}} looks to check his drive but the sticker on the pitch makes him check his shot. He does so and chips it to a flying AB at cover. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! ABD takes it again. He is having a dream of a match. And the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} departs. RCB are surely winning it now. He fails to get under the delivery, swings hard at it. It goes a long way up in the air and lands in safe hands of ABD. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 46(28) [4s-1 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by K Paul!! And another South African is on a hat-trick. Slower delivery, {{BATSMAN}} got under the ball and slammed the slog sweep for it to be taken at deep mid. Keemo Paul in the deep mid region gobbled it up. {{BOWLER}} is on a hat-trick now. {{BATSMAN}} c K Paul b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Another one bites the dust. Three wickets in four balls for {{BOWLER}}. The ball stuck a bit on the surface. It was a shortish delivery, {{BATSMAN}} is a bit early to close his bat face. The leading edge flies to the left of the bowler, who times his dive to his left to perfection. A terrific catch in his followthrough. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tymal Mills!! The hole gets deeper. The collapse gets more dramatic and {{TEAM}} lose their last known hope of stealing a few more. A rank drag down this to start off from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} meanwhile opens himself up, shapes up for the pull and outside edges it. Thanks to the sticker on the pitch. Ballons in and out and then back into the palms of short third. Oh Mills. Almost a comical end. {{BATSMAN}} c Tymal Mills b {{BOWLER}} 15(19) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! You don't need to be a genius at this. Anyone can see that {{BATSMAN}} has no chance against the swinging and pacy {{BOWLER}}. Especially at the death. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get in line, just stands outside leg and wafts his bat through the line. The late reverse swing takes the leg stump out and sends it out of its groove. That's clinical execution at the death. Perhaps the best exponent with the ball when bowling at the end in the world. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jordan!! This is a reckless start from the Capitals - short of a good length and well wide of off, not the length to be attempting the pull - {{BATSMAN}} goes for it, gets it low off the bat and it spoons high and towards mid-on. Jordan is the man under it and you don't expect him to drop those. Number two for the Kings and no wonder their management and owners look thrilled. {{BATSMAN}} c Jordan b {{BOWLER}} 5(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Eoin Morgan!! Done in for pace. An important wicket for KXIP. {{BATSMAN}} was looking to get on with proceedings. Short and angled across off, pulling against the angle is always dangerous, {{BATSMAN}} takes it on and splices it towards mid-off. Morgan might be having a rough day with his ground fielding, but not with his catching. Accepts the dolly with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Eoin Morgan b {{BOWLER}} 15(9) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! That's plumb. Out. Gone. Dead. {{BATSMAN}} has played right across a full one and missed it. The ball hurries on to hit low on his pad in front of middle and that's crashing into the stumps. Not a great deal of movement, just a hint of inswing but {{BATSMAN}} falters by opting to play across the line first up. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! He strikes! The customary celebration follows. One hand up and the finger pointing skywards. The most delighted man in the dugout was his fellow countryman - Mohammad Nabi. He too had his finger up in celebration. The quicker wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} clearly did not pick it, went back for the cut and gets cramped for room, only manages a chop onto the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 24(16) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} looks surprised by the decision, but that's absolutely dead in front. That's crashing into the middle of middle. Full and straight from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} tries to lap it fine but misses and the ball crashes into his pad. Gone! {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 3(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Rinku Singh!! Big wicket for KKR. Another failure for {{BATSMAN}} this season. Only three times he has gone past 20 this season and Mumbai have won on all three occasions. They need someone now to take them close to that 200-mark. An off-spinner and it was too full to be sweeping, {{BATSMAN}} could not get underneath it completely and the top-edge skies towards deep mid-wicket. Rinku on as a substitute takes it calmly. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Rinku Singh b {{BOWLER}} 11(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Chopped on! {{BOWLER}} strikes and early troubles for {{TEAM}}. A back of a length delivery at 140.9kph wide of off. It was there to be hit, but {{BATSMAN}} was lethargic as he threw his bat at it without any feet movement. Gets a big inside edge which cannons onto this sticks. Replays show that the ball nipped in a touch. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! What was that? {{BATSMAN}} puts his hand up in an apologetic manner towards Yadav, I guess. Back of a length delivery, clocked at 143kph, {{BATSMAN}} stays back in the crease and is through the shot even before the ball arrived, the ball takes the cue-end and skies to sweeper cover. Dhawan completes the catch and does his thigh slap. {{BATSMAN}} was so much early that his bottom hand came off the bat handle as he made contact with the ball. Timely wicket for Hyderabad and not for Mumbai as {{BATSMAN}} was looking in ominous form. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 28(23) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, loud shout for LBW and RCB want a review. Kohli looked very keen to challenge the call. It's a fair delivery from {{BOWLER}}, it has pitched in line, but is it spinning down leg? There's no bat and Ultraedge confirms it. I don't think it straightened enough, Hawk-Eye in and it's missing the leg-stump. RCB have lost their review. This was tossed up on middle and was spinning into the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} swept and missed, was struck on the pads, in front of leg and the angle was traking it down the leg-stump. The ball rolls away towards the off-side, the fielder has a shy at the bowler's end and concedes an overthrow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shankar!! Second for {{BOWLER}}. Not the greatest of deliveries but SRH won't be complaining. Another one of {{TEAM}}'s big hitters is back in the pavilion. It was a half tracker and {{BATSMAN}} picked it early, went back and pulled it flat to deep mid-wicket. He just could not place it better. {{BATSMAN}} c Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 11(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Searles!! Gone. Taken at long-on. That was dragged short, quicker as well. The batsman went for the pull but there was no distance on it. A lot of elevation though and was taken in the deep. Huge strike again from KKR. They keep dragging this back. The batsman got a bit carried away with the length I guess but the half-trackers have done the job in this edition of the IPL. {{BATSMAN}} c Searles b {{BOWLER}} 50(38) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! That's a fine comeback from the leggie. The leg-break and he has got rid of the dangerous KL. Was it the adrenaline that was pumping inside KL? He lost his head and he has lost his wicket now. Came rushing forward, didn't spot the leg-break, beaten in the flight and the drift - swung all over the place and Parthiv has an easy stumping to his name. {{BATSMAN}} st Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 18(15) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! It's in the blockhole. {{BATSMAN}} has been walking all across, but has been getting down in time to dig things out. Until this one. It's full, it's into the base of leg, and {{BATSMAN}}' walked across, freezing in front of the stumps as he tries using the angle to swipe it behind square. Done in for pace. Done in for dip. This is exactly where Rajasthan need to avoid doing a Mumbai. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 40(27) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! Soft dismissal! {{BOWLER}} tried the yorker but ended up delivering a pacy low full toss. {{BATSMAN}} just tried to check the lofted stroke, perhaps got a touch late on it and ended up chipping it straight to mid-off where the RCB skipper swallowed it up. He's wearing an animated look on his face as well. Vital wicket this for RCB, {{BATSMAN}} could easily have a made a difference of about 10 runs. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 23(14) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Yuvraj!! Gone this time. Yuvraj makes no mistake at backward point. What a top over this has been from {{BOWLER}}. It may now be a mountain too high for the {{TEAM}} to climb. {{BATSMAN}} backs away to slash a back of a length delivery over point. But this is a leg-cutter which bounces spongily and he slices it up to the fielder. {{BATSMAN}} c Yuvraj b {{BOWLER}} 11(10) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned up. Full and straight, with a late tail back in. {{BATSMAN}} swings to leg and can't connect. The ball clips the leg stump and {{BOWLER}} punches the air in delight. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 8(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Innocuous dismissal for {{BATSMAN}}, lovely stuff from {{BOWLER}} - this was the wrong 'un, {{BATSMAN}} came down the track, didn't get close to the ball, with bat and pad close-by, he pushed with hard hands, a simple lobe back at the bowler and it's celebration time amongst the Royals. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 5(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! An excellent innings from {{BATSMAN}} comes to an end. He is a disappointed, looks upwards after giving the catch. It was a flatter one on the stumps and {{BATSMAN}} smashes it straight back to the bowler. It was hit at a ferocious pace and {{BOWLER}} did really well to grab the catch. He takes off the bails at the non striker's end too, not sure why. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 43(21) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Willey!! {{BOWLER}} has his second! He doesn't celebrate like he usually does. Just stares at the batsman. Not sure why he has been subdued today despite getting the wickets. Probably the pressure leading upto today is the reason. Coming to the wicket, not the kind of shot {{BATSMAN}} should be playing when you are trying to rebuild. Tries to take Jaddu on with a slog sweep but doesn't quite get hold of it. There is a deep backward square leg in place, precisely for this and he gobbles to up. More problems for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Willey b {{BOWLER}} 7(13)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Krunal Pandya Run Out!! 1 run completed. More running troubles. {{BOWLER}} standing in the way and Krunal has to take a step away to ensure he doesn't collide again. Can't afford getting injured. Well the tournament can't afford anyone else getting injured, the replacements aren't leaving their Counties. Right, {{BATSMAN}} smashed it down the ground, wants the strike. Pandya has to sacrifice. Hesitated for the second, stopped and takes the longer route. Alas, the dive is too late. Krunal Pandya run out (Woakes/{{BOWLER}}) 15(12) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bairstow!! {{BATSMAN}} is walking! No century but hasn't he put on a show tonight or what! Was a good short ball from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} got rushed on the pull. There was a definite top edge as it went through to Bairstow who took a stunning one-handed catch, diving to his left. The umpire was probably blinded and didn't know what to do. {{BATSMAN}} did the right thing, would have been out anyway if SRH reviewed this. Ends a sensational knock from one of IPL's and T20 cricket's legend. {{BATSMAN}} c Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 96(53) [4s-9 6s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out de Villiers Run Out!! Miscommunication personified. The two men were clueless, stranded almost midway on the 22 yards and the end result is a calamitous one. ABD is gone. That was pushed away into the off-side with the outer half of the bat and then the mix-up followed. Yes-no, yes-no, ABD somehow moved past {{BATSMAN}} and the direct hit at the striker's end meant the end for him. ABD did make the initial call though. de Villiers run out (Jadeja) 5(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Timber! 145.7kph, very full and attacking the sticks from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} backs away a long way and is too late to bring his horizontal bat down. Crashes into the base of off and middle. First wicket for {{BOWLER}}, is it too late though? {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 63(45) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Bangalore are falling apart here. Colin {{BATSMAN}} always finds it difficult to bat against spin early in the innings and the difficulty goes up in these sorts of pitches. Ravindra Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja gave a bit of flight on this occasion and CdG was half-forward for a tentative push. Gets a faint outsi{{BATSMAN}} edge and Dhoni makes no mistakes. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja 4(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tahir! The Yellow Army explodes! Another one @130.7km/h, on a length and angling into the body, {{BATSMAN}} clears his leg and backs away going for a wild heave, gets a massive top-edge towards third man where Tahir gets under the pressure catch - pouches it and sets off on a celebratory run. {{BATSMAN}} c Tahir b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Anureet Singh!! Strokes has another. Oh where was he hiding all this while? Anyway, it takes him to dish out a short-slower sticker into the pitch. {{BATSMAN}} as usual can't resist, loads up with a leg-cleared-cut. But doesn't quite adjust to the time the ball takes in getting there, slices off the top-edge and deep point couldn't have been placed better. {{BATSMAN}} c Anureet Singh b {{BOWLER}} 45(42) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! {{BATSMAN}} perishes. Huge blow for {{TEAM}}. Two wickets in the over and {{BOWLER}} is turning it on here. Seemed like a certain ploy and {{BATSMAN}} fell into the trap. Dug in short and there was a fiel{{BATSMAN}}r positioned at {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket. AB forgets, goes for the pull, doesn't bother to keep it down either. Flat and straight to Hardik, who cupped it. Straight down the gullet, didn't even had to move there. MI on top. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Negi!! Another wicket. It's brought a smile on a couple of faces for RCB. {{BOWLER}} drifts this wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} chases it for the drive wanting to smash it through the covers but because it's so wide, he gets it close to the bottom of the bat which spoils his timing. Skews it to short cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Negi b {{BOWLER}} 14(16)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! {{BOWLER}} strikes. Suckered {{BATSMAN}} by tossing it up and the Kerala lad fell into the trap. It was in the slot for {{BATSMAN}}, he cleared his front leg and whacked hard - the bat face turns on impact and he ends up slicing it straight to long-on. Dolly for Tiwary and Punjab break the stand. Rahman, with the golden arm. {{BATSMAN}} c Manoj Tiwary b {{BOWLER}} 22(18) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! There's going to be drama here, make no mistake. This is getting a bit too uncomfortable for the Royals, and when you see shots like this, you understand why. {{BATSMAN}} has swiped right across the line of this delivery, missed it completely and lost his stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! Gone. Hit a six earlier in the over and now perishes in trying to drive along the ground. That's modern cricket in a nutshell. A bit of drift away from the batsman, which is why {{BATSMAN}} stretched his front foot right across, but a bit of spin did him in. Something that you didn't expect out of {{BOWLER}} but he's produced it. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 11(11) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! This was coming. {{BATSMAN}} was not quite able to find the fence despite his regular attempts. This time curmudgeonly steps down to go down town. The googly was always going across him. Once he did not meet the pitch of the ball, the doom was waiting. Pant did not do anything silly, collected the ball and whipped the bails. {{BATSMAN}} st Pant b {{BOWLER}} 25(22) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Finally, he's been dismissed. Fullish on middle, probably a tired shot from {{BATSMAN}} as he can't middle this swipe. It comes off the bottom and picks out Shubman at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Shubman Gill b {{BOWLER}} 100(58) [4s-9 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mishra!! Big wicket for DD. How many times have we seen {{BATSMAN}} get out like this? He was dismissed at least thrice in this manner in the previous Ashes. Short ball at a good pace - close to 145kph. {{BATSMAN}} is caught in two minds - to go hard on his pull or just tap it on the on-side. In the end, he brings his bat down a bit late and the ball lobs up off the leading edge. Mishra, from short fine leg, runs forward and gobbles it up. {{BATSMAN}} c Mishra b {{BOWLER}} 4(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Aravind!! What a dream spell from {{BOWLER}}. Finishes it with a wicket. His fourth of the evening. {{BATSMAN}} bites the dirt. Was itching to smack this quicker delivery, it was wider of off. The width was there and {{BATSMAN}} went after it with a flashy cut. He forgets to keep it down and hits it straight to point. Aravind dives forward and takes a fine low catch. {{TEAM}} sink further into the mire. {{BATSMAN}} c Aravind b {{BOWLER}} 11(16) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Goswami!! {{BOWLER}} is riding a horse in celebration. Or something like that. He's undone {{BATSMAN}} with a short ball. Weight not quite back, the bounce getting big on the batsman, and we have a top-edge, that the keeper runs around and collects it near say leg gully. {{BATSMAN}} c Goswami b {{BOWLER}} 45(34) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The {{TEAM}} fans are stunned into deathly silence. Deathly. While {{BOWLER}} celebrates with a finger-twirling celebration. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't pick {{BOWLER}}, slogs in hope to a googly which is bowled on a fuller length and sees the stumps re-arranged. Difficult to say whether {{BOWLER}} has the wood over {{BATSMAN}} - a very small sample size for that. But for sure {{BOWLER}} has the bragging rights over the {{TEAM}} skipper. {{BATSMAN}} was so disappointed at missing that. Rarely does he miss those, but tonight he did. Massive massive wicket too. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 12(11) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Aaron!! {{TEAM}} are struggling here. Varun Aaron in action again. A quick-ish googly that skids through off the deck outside off. On seeing the line, {{BATSMAN}} went hard on the cut. He didn't bother to keep it down and paid the price. Offers a dolly to backward point and Aaron doesn't err. {{BATSMAN}} c Aaron b {{BOWLER}} 21(26) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Michael Clarke called it on air. He wanted {{BOWLER}} to go full and straight. {{BOWLER}} does exactly that. The finger went up slowly. Bhajji goes for a first baller. That was an inswinging full ball. The ball thudded onto the pad and the rest was easy for the ump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! Edged and caught! A pre-meditated slog from {{BATSMAN}} as he shuffled right across the stumps, {{BOWLER}} saw it coming and fired it wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} was aiming for the mid-wicket fence, gets a thick and audible edge through, KL doesn't drop those and it's a much needed wicket for KXIP. They have got rid of one dangerman, but here comes the bigger danger - it's Andre Russell. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 74(41) [4s-6 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Zaheer!! Yes, the break does its job. The leg-spinner from {{BOWLER}}, spinning the other way and {{BATSMAN}}'s committed slog-sweep has him holing out. The air on this one makes him lose his timing as well with the ball only managing the toe-end as he swings it down the throat of mid-wicket. Delhi needed this big time, pouching {{BATSMAN}} just when he was about to explode. {{BATSMAN}} c Zaheer b {{BOWLER}} 48(38) [4s-3 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! Edged and gone! {{BOWLER}} provides the early breakthrough for MI. How often has he done this? The away angler that's full and moves away just a bit, {{BATSMAN}} is stuck on the crease as he opts for that flamboyant drive of his. Looks good when it comes off but not here, as he only gets an edge that's taken sharply by de Kock moving to his right. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 7(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Is this match being played in Pune? Then why are they cheering for the fall of their own? That is because the wicket brings MS Dhoni to the middle. The carrom ball which is short in length, {{BATSMAN}} just took a step out and tried to carve it into the off-side, beaten and Uthappa was quick this time. The back foot was initially on the line, {{BATSMAN}} lifted it to get back in and Uthappa took that opportunity to light up the bails. {{BATSMAN}} st Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 46(41) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Warner!! {{BATSMAN}} throws his head back in disappointment as Warner completes the catch at long-off. He wanted to drive this much wider of him after giving himself some room. But couldn't open the face enough on contact. The timing is sweet, which is what brings Warner into play as it carries all the way to him. {{BATSMAN}} c Warner b {{BOWLER}} 39(34) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! A chop on from Chota Gayle. He gets a start, but throws it away. We have seen that way too many times. Did the job though. Googly from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} goes back to cut, looked too close for the shot and ended up dragging it back onto the sticks. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 31(22) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Harbhajan!! Another batsman goes without troubling the scorers. {{BOWLER}} has both has his hands up in a gesture which says, that was easy. Back of a length delivery angled across off, {{BATSMAN}} hangs his bat away from the body, the ball takes a healthy edge and flies to the lone slipper, Harbhajan clings on comfortably. Five down and things going down very quickly for DD. {{BATSMAN}} c Harbhajan b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} gets the all-important breakthrough. But is it too late for Delhi? It was a slider on a fuller length, it skids off the deck. {{BATSMAN}} was late on the shot, it misses his bat and raps him on the pads. Umpire raised his finger straightaway but optimistic Jonny challenged that decision (I don't know why) and was proved wrong within minutes. He misses his fifty by 2 runs. But has done enough damage at the top to put his team in the driver's seat. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 48(28) [4s-9 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bumrah!! Mumbai have found a way past their ex. {{BATSMAN}}, as strong as he's through square on the off-side, has a few issues against the short ball. So {{BOWLER}} does exactly that. Angles this seam-up short ball across from over the wicket, has {{BATSMAN}} fetching the pull from outside off, and has him top-edging. Taken at deep square leg by Bumrah, who drops down to take it one-handed amidst fears of a spill. {{BATSMAN}} c Bumrah b {{BOWLER}} 31(27) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The fallacy of the Kotla wicket does {{BATSMAN}} in - this wasn't a slower ball, but there's no pace on this off-cutter - {{BATSMAN}} came down the track and was way too early on the slog - completed the shot even before the ball arrived, let a big gap between bat and pad - the ball found its way and rattled the top of middle-stump. {{BOWLER}} loved it, his second wicket of the day and the Royals have lost both openers. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 14(13) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! Excellent catch from Unadkat - he seemed to have lost it under the lights, puts in the full-stretch dive and just about holds on. Second wicket for {{BOWLER}} and Pune are finishing strong. It was a length ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} backed away on the heave, ended up getting a fat top-edge that spiralled in the air and behind Dhoni. Unadkat ran across to his left from short third man, called for the catch, seemed to have misjudged it - but held on with a dive. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 64(45) [4s-9]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. A run out so bad that they are checking which batsman is out. Both are at the same end and the umpires have to decide who's made it back in. {{BATSMAN}} drags it down to long-on, gets to the other end and chaos takes over then. Ishan runs back for the second, {{BATSMAN}} was unsure about it. Intended. Then not. Then again. But hey, Ishan is at your end. You better get back in. But he's ball-watching and Ishan edge-crosses him at the bowler's end, getting past the marker line quicker. Keeper Kedar Jadhav takes the bails off. Had so much time there, with both the batsman fighting it out at the other end. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Negi/Kedar Jadhav) 23(22) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Peach from {{BOWLER}}. Absolute peach. Knocks over {{BATSMAN}}'s middle-stump with a ripping leg-break and he's off. 150th wicket for {{BOWLER}} in IPL - only the second bowler to achieve that feat. What a start for him and DC draw first blood. It was pitched on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} was waiting on the back foot and misjudges it. It also stayed low and spun sharply to make it difficult for the {{TEAM}} captain as he was rooted to the crease. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 30(22) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Harshal Patel!! Top-edged splice. 151ks, back of a length, outside off and {{BATSMAN}} attempted carve over point ends up at third man, where Harshal does rather well to get low and under. {{BATSMAN}} c Harshal Patel b {{BOWLER}} 5(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} has his man. This was tossed up on the leg-stump line, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to turn it towards the on-side, the ball straightened and went past his inside edge, struck him low and in front of leg-stump, would have been crashing into the stumps. Easy call for the umpire and it's also time for the strategic break. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 35(24) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Miller!! Another short ball. Another top-edge. Another catch. The tried and tested ploy of snaring wickets all day fetches another. {{BOWLER}} persist bending his back and banging it in. More of the kick up on this occasion. Gets too big for {{BATSMAN}} in the end as he throws his bat up in the air and just swishes it cross faced. Off the cue end to deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Miller b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! That's a top catch from Pant and {{BOWLER}} has got his man - followed the slower yorker with a fiery bouncer - short and angling down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to help it on its way - all that he managed was a glove. The ball was travelling, but Pant tumbled to his left, leapt high and completed a fine catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 28(30) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Switches his legs, looks for the reverse-sweep again but completely misses this full toss. It rams into middle and leg stump from round the wicket. He was doing a decent job of hitting straight, probably didn't need to do that. But a superb knock nevertheless. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 44(23) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! Pace off the ball and {{BATSMAN}} has clipped it straight into the hands of Kohli at mid-wicket - yelps in despair, but he can now go and cool his heels in the dressing room. Flatter and at the stumps, perhaps it straightened a bit off the pitch, {{BATSMAN}} went back on the clip, didn't account for the drift and the leading edge went straight into the hands of the opposition skipper. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 30(23) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Gone! Three wickets in three overs and Pune are in trouble now. {{BATSMAN}} bites the dirt. {{BOWLER}} reaps reward for his tidy bowling. Again slants it wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} went for a pull. Wasn't too short and all he could manage was an under-edge that was gobbled up by Pant. Smart catch, must say as it was dying. He bent forward and took it cleanly. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! {{TEAM}} in Kamikaze mode here at the Chinnaswamy. And {{BOWLER}} with the breakthrough again for SRH. He has been absolutely superb for his side. It was another well disguised slower one and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to lift it over mid-on. He was taken aback by the slower one, he miscues it horribly and Pandey at mid-on takes it with utmost ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! That's P.L.U.M.B! If that's not out, nothing else can be. {{BOWLER}} outfoxes Robbie with the off-cutter. He was looking to flick across the line but he gets beaten due to the lack of pace. Struck in front of middle and it would have crashed into middle and leg. Middle, probably. No reviews left and even if there was one, it wouldn't have made a difference. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 11(6) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! What a moment in the game. Look at the celebrations in the RPS camp. They reckon they've pocketed the game. {{BATSMAN}} is livid with himself. Swings his bat hard in disappointment. He knows that he's hit a long hop to the fielder. Short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} went back, lost balance while playing the pull shot, didn't middle it, Thakur jumped at deep mid-wicket and took the catch. The momentum was taking him back, took a couple of steps back, just managed to stay away from the rope and the third impire was convinced he didn't touch the boundary. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 24(22) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Maiden IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}}. It's the big one. A well-set {{BATSMAN}} departs soon after the strategic break. I guess it should be renamed to wicket-taking-break. Second time today that GL have got a wicket after the time-out. Flatter and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and slaps it straight back, it was traveling quickly and {{BOWLER}} did well to bend down and pouch that. Made it look easy did the youngster. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 65(40) [4s-9 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Bowled 'em. {{BOWLER}} sends {{BATSMAN}} packing back to the hut. Very, very poor shot from the southpaw. Totally misjudged the length there. It was rifled quick outside off, the ball was skidding off the pitch. {{BATSMAN}} with his knee bent first tried to sweep and then as an afterthought tried to open his bat face to guide it past the solitary slip. But the ball just fizzed off the deck, took his inside edge and deflected back onto the stumps. {{BOWLER}} breaks into a celebratory jig. Just the wicket RR wanted, the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} back to the hut early. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! {{TEAM}} have gifted away a wicket here. Bad communication between two senior members. Length ball around off and {{BATSMAN}} punched it towards cover from the crease. Raina stopped it with a dive with his left hand, picks the ball and hits the bullseye at the bowler's end. {{BATSMAN}} was ball-watching and Karthik was halfway down. One had to go at the danger's end, and {{BATSMAN}} went for it. This is a big wicket. Raina has his arms aloft. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Raina) 29(16) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! Wow. Wow. Three wickets in quick time and suddenly the score isn't looking that great. High full toss, was meant to be hit for six but {{BATSMAN}} mistimed that and looked like it was falling in front of the fielder, but Hooda came in and snaffled that low and diving forward. {{BOWLER}} can't contain his smile. Can't believe his luck either. DK just puts his head down in disappointment, unable to believe the shot he played. {{BATSMAN}} c Deepak Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! DK and his slog, well, the love story isn't screening tonight. {{BOWLER}}'s kept it simple -- quick, straight, on off, no room, no spin. {{BATSMAN}} goes one-kneed early, premeditatingly, and misses the sweep all ends up. Yep, plumb, not even worth reviewing a review. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 30(23) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Razor sharp work from Pant! Was a googly from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} went across the line for a big hit. Missed it and the DC keeper was lightning quick to dislodge the bails. {{BATSMAN}} st Pant b {{BOWLER}} 10(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Faulkner!! In the airrrr, the timing is not there and mid-on back-pedals to take a good catch. The {{BATSMAN}} cameo ends, but he's done a great job for his side. {{BOWLER}} bowls flat and on the leg stump cramping the batsman for room, {{BATSMAN}} was on the back foot and couldn't time the pull shot well enough to collect another boundary. Totally mistimed it and holed out to mid-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Faulkner b {{BOWLER}} 42(17) [4s-9 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Chahar!! Scuffed off the inside half, taken at long-on. He wasn't quite to the pitch while going for the loft, and hence the miscue. {{TEAM}} struggling to get the spinners away. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Chahar b {{BOWLER}} 5(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Not falling short this time around, Shreyas Iyer has his bucket hands wrapped around the dolly of a catch. Honestly, it's catching practice! {{BATSMAN}} once again is early into his shot as he tries to loft the 144.2ks delivery over long-off. Doesn't get anywhere near the middle and Iyer does the rest. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! {{BOWLER}} has the last laugh and pumps his fists. Just when {{BATSMAN}} was looking more threatening, DD have sent him packing back to the hut. The wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}} that foxes {{BATSMAN}}, stepped forward and aimed to for a cross-batted slog over long-on. The ball dips and turns in to slider under his bat. Pant was waiting behind and breaks the stumps in time. {{BATSMAN}} st Pant b {{BOWLER}} 48(31) [4s-3 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has struck early and it's a poor start for {{TEAM}} once again! Lack of application did {{BATSMAN}} there, on a length and angling back into the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was rooted to his crease as he aimed a shovel over mid-wicket, gets an inside edge and the ball just clips the bails - the zing lights are up and RPS celebrate. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The leg stump has been flattened! Outstanding over from {{BOWLER}}, just three runs and has taken two wickets too. After a series of fiery pacy deliveries, he opts for the slower one, the back-of-the-hand option and {{BATSMAN}} clearly hasn't picked it at all. Saw the length very short and backed away for the pull but the ball never really arrived. Ends up getting an inside edge that damages the woodwork. Brilliant fightback from the Royals. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} gets his man and {{BATSMAN}} walks back raising his bat. Gets a standing ovation from his team mates in the dug-out. It was a flipper that did the trick. {{BATSMAN}} looked to pull it through the on-side and failed to make connection. The ball cannons onto the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 102(63) [4s-8 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! This is the fifth time {{BOWLER}} Patel has dismissed Watto in IPL, the most he has dismissed any batsman. Just wow! A quicker flatter dart outside off, from Jaddu's book you would think. {{BATSMAN}} goes deep inside the crease to flay it square, feeds the faintest of nicks to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 3(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gambhir!! Deception from {{BOWLER}} and he dismisses {{BATSMAN}}. The slower delivery just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} this time scooped it straight up in the air and Gambhir tracked back from cover to settle under that. {{BATSMAN}} c Gambhir b {{BOWLER}} 59(35) [4s-5 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! Time-out and wickets. The love-story world does not care about! Slower ball around off and middle. {{BATSMAN}} gets early on the push and the bat turns in his hand, making the ball to pop up towards captain Raina at mid-wicket. What a soft dismissal that is and that too against the run of play. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 30(24) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! {{BOWLER}} has his revenge! Must say that Pollard owns the credits for this wicket, a sharp catch diving to his right. {{BATSMAN}} will be disappointed, looked really good while he was there and this wasn't a wicket-taking ball either. Was pitched up for the drive and he couldn't keep the shot down. Was travelling towards the extra cover region where KP plucks it out. {{TEAM}} have been dented early. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 16(10) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! Taken. Taken, taken, taken. It's a brilliant catch from Jadeja, sprinting forward from long-on and diving in front with two hands. Oh {{BATSMAN}}. He's done in by this slower ball. Back of length from {{BOWLER}}, the ball stops on {{BATSMAN}} who miscues his flat-batted swipe off the splice. {{BOWLER}} shows off with his dance moves. CSK will back themselves from here. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 84(51) [4s-5 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That roar and fist pump says it all. Just takes one delivery for {{BOWLER}} to change the tide. A fine knock from {{BATSMAN}} comes to an end. Battled hard and has built a platform for his lower-order. Straight delivery, {{BATSMAN}} plays all round it, the ball sneaks through bat and pad to hit middle stump. Two set batsmen gone and MI keeping the lid over {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 64(44) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has the final laugh. One shot too many for {{BATSMAN}}. Just sticks to his basics and targets the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} exposed his stumps aiming for a flashy punch through cover. The ball striaghtened a bit and the {{TEAM}} skipper misses it completely. The ball kisses the top of off. Talk about basics, Laxman Sivaramakrishnan will be a proud man. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 9(9) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! That's a big wicket for RPS, another failure for AB. Massive celebration, they know how big this wicket is. On a good length and just outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, AB saw the width and creamed it off the back-foot - didn't bother to keep it down though - straight into the bucket hands of Tiwary at short extra-cover. He holds on and {{TEAM}} have lost their second wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Manoj Tiwary b {{BOWLER}} 3(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Huge wicket in the context for {{TEAM}} and it's {{BOWLER}} who's got his England skipper. Surprises {{BATSMAN}} with a short ball and gets good fizz off the pitch to get it climbing and restrain the timing on the shot, {{BATSMAN}} was probably aiming for the deep square region, but the shot lacked intent and MSD does the rest behind the sticks. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 7(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Not again! {{BATSMAN}} tries for another switch hit and this time it doesn't come off, ends up playing it off the back of the bat as the ball slid onto him and then the heroics of PP. He anticipated the shot, moved quickly to his left and dived full length before nestling it inches above the turf. Stunning catch that. {{BATSMAN}} c Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 49(34) [4s-7 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hooda!! Proving to be a fruitful night for {{BOWLER}}. Comes back into the attack and gets the big fish. Bowls a low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} looks to lift it over long-on. Gets it off the bottom end of the bat as it's miscued towards the man charging in. Hooda is the man in the deep who takes it. {{BATSMAN}} c Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 23(19) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Sharp bouncer, a left-arm round angle that climbs up around the head, which {{BATSMAN}} has no option but to try pulling off his front foot. Top-edged, tame, and deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Abdul Samad!! Goneeee! Just needed two balls to get a breakthrough. {{BATSMAN}} wasn't in his zone tonight. Wanted to slice it over extra cover, the bat face turned in his hands at the point of contact and as a result of which, he skies it to deep cover. Samad runs in, doesn't panic and grabs it. His first catch in IPL and {{TEAM}} have lost their second wicket. {{BOWLER}} is thrilled. {{BATSMAN}} c Abdul Samad b {{BOWLER}} 17(21) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Wicket-maiden! This over exemplies how a bowler sets up a batsman. After varying stuffs for 5 deliveries, he keeps this one short around off. There is almost no pace off the track and {{BATSMAN}}, who is waiting to slap off the back foot, makes a mess of the timing. Chipping it back off the lower half of the bat to the bowler. {{BOWLER}} almost grabs it in a hurry. What a start for Pune. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 0(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Slogs, connects hard and flat, but picks out deep mid-wicket, and who should it be there. Of course Rashid Khan. To {{BOWLER}}'s credit, he bowled this pretty full and prevented {{BATSMAN}} from getting much elevation. {{TEAM}} will at least have Gill on strike. {{BATSMAN}} c Rashid Khan b {{BOWLER}} 6(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Billings!! The RRR may be in the 3s, but that's not bad enough for {{BOWLER}} to deny himself the marathon-to-nowhere celebration. And he's earned it with a ripper of a leg-break - pitching on a length, drawing {{BATSMAN}} forward in classical style, only to spit up a touch more off the pitch and take the splice through to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Billings b {{BOWLER}} 7(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! The short ball does the trick. {{BOWLER}}, at 131kph, darts a bumper on leg. The ball gets big on {{BATSMAN}}, who is late on his pull. The ball balloons off bat and glove to settles into the hands of Unadkat at short fine leg. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 19(12) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by K Paul!! Mishy provides the massive strike! {{BATSMAN}} was looking ominous and DC badly wanted to see the back of him. That's precisely what their senior most bowler has done in his very second delivery of the match. Floated it up, inviting the big shot but the length wasn't there for the slog sweep as {{BATSMAN}} went through with the stroke. Skews it towards deep mid-wicket where Paul took a fine tumbling catch. DC have sprung to life with this wicket! {{BATSMAN}} c K Paul b {{BOWLER}} 36(19) [4s-1 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Swipes behind square. And he runs. He HAS TO. Beats short fine leg. But all his desperation is good enough for a single. Uthappa swooped in there, and capped it with a flat throw at the striker's. And DK turns the lights up .. SUPER OVER. Oh Kolkata have stolen this, right under Delhi's nose. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Uthappa/Karthik) 10(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Nah, not again! Looks to fancy his chances against the wily {{BOWLER}}. Not to the pitch and was caught miles short. 83ks, lands on the seam and moves the other way round and beats {{BATSMAN}} neck and crop. Uthappa does the rest. He was looking to go over long-on/mid-wicket. Booming bat swing, but no dice. {{BATSMAN}} st Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 13(7) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nortje!! You can't deny {{BOWLER}} for long at the death. He thrives in these situations and has struck a vital blow here. Cross-seamer from {{BOWLER}}, very full and {{BATSMAN}} made room for the loft. Didn't get any timing whatsoever and absolutely sent this straight up into the night skies. We've seen many such ones dropped, but Nortje holds his composure and takes it near the deep mid-off region. {{BATSMAN}} falls after an workman-like innings. {{BATSMAN}} c Nortje b {{BOWLER}} 53(48) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Man{{BOWLER}}ep!! Short, wi{{BOWLER}} and OUT. Looks like RCB have found a way of taking wickets, another soft dismissal for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} is the man to go, he saw the width, went with hard hands on the cut, nailed the shot but didn't bother to keep it down. Straight into the bucket like hands of Man{{BOWLER}}ep at backward point. DO RCB stand a chance here? {{BATSMAN}} c Man{{BOWLER}}ep b {{BOWLER}} 8(9) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kuldeep Yadav!! Better plans from {{BOWLER}} with these last couple of deliveries. He's gone back to round the wicket and bowled this pretty wide outside off. {{BATSMAN}} has to stretch out to reach it, and as he does, the timing is not the same. He slices this up into the accepting hands of sweeper cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Kuldeep Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 37(18) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! The slog sweep comes out wrong. The extra bit of flight induces the big fat top-edge on the slog sweep and Hooda this time doesn't err. He runs across to his right and takes it with both hands. There was no turn on that ball but the batsman was expecting some. {{BATSMAN}} c Deepak Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 26(21) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Excellent grab by Manish that, fumbles on the first attempt but manages to hold on as he's about to hit the ground. Was short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} cut that hard to point where a rather sharp Manish pulled off a screamer. Replays confirm that the catch was taken and SRH strike right aftter the break. {{BOWLER}} is absolutely loving this, bounce and pace has helped him put the pressure on {{BATSMAN}} as he gets his scalp. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 18(16) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! Not over, yet. Still need 17 runs off 11 balls. Credit must go to Thampi for bowling a tight 18th over. {{BATSMAN}} had to take the risk and he perishes while doing so. Full and slow, on middle and leg, since there was no pace, {{BATSMAN}} could not gather momentum on the flick, skies it towards deep mid-wicket, Jadeja won't drop those. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 39(23) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gayle!! That's gone! Have to give full marks to Gayle for this effort. Both openers are back in the pavilion without doing much. Was short of a length and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went hard at it and got an outside edge. Gayle at first slip was quick to get down and reverse cup it just before the ball was about to hit ground. Had his fingers beneath and the replays confirm it. {{BATSMAN}} c Gayle b {{BOWLER}} 14(15) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hetmyer!! Brave delivery this -- back of a length, into the body and {{BATSMAN}} in fact swipes it rather well. But no, it's flat and straight to a waiting backward square leg. The trick was that this one skidded along more than normal, getting {{BATSMAN}} crouched more than normal. Okay, now, surely game over? No? Okay. {{BATSMAN}} c Hetmyer b {{BOWLER}} 44(18) [4s-1 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! A typical number 10 run-out. {{BATSMAN}} works the off-break past mid-wicket, but was not sure whether to go for the run or not, he decides late and AB from mid-wicket runs back, slides and fires a throw to Mo, who deflects the ball onto the stumps. Brilliant bit of work from AB and Mo. {{BATSMAN}} run out (de Villiers/{{BOWLER}}) 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! Maiden IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}} and he's been mighty impressive. Ends an excellent innings from {{BATSMAN}}. Shortish slower delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} slices it high in the air, Jadeja runs forward from sweeper cover and swallows it. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 79(45) [4s-7 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Poor piece of running there. First of all he tried to reverse sweep it and as it went off the pads to short third man. {{BATSMAN}} wanted the run but Uthappa sent him back. There was no chance that Uthappa would have completed the run. Unadkat is the man who throws it at the keeper's end to catch {{BATSMAN}} well short of his crease. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Unadkat/Buttler) 35(25) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Gone! This man from Ernakulam is too good at this stage of the innings. Full and tailing in, hint of reverse swing. {{BATSMAN}} walks across in his crease and looks to clip it through the on-side. Gets an inside edge that cannons onto the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 96(57) [4s-15 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! That's another addition to the Dhoni collection of brilliant stumpings. {{BATSMAN}}'s back foot barely lifts up for a brief moment, and that's enough for Dhoni as he whips the bails off in a flash. Superb delivery to begin with from {{BOWLER}}, managed to turn it at pace to which {{BATSMAN}} had no answer. {{BATSMAN}} st Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! What a soft dismissal. And full credit to Kohli for placing himself there. Chipped in the air and straight to the RCB skipper. Did {{BATSMAN}} not realise Kohli was right in his face? He swings the air with his bat in frustration. Held up on the pitch and tamely played by {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} was surprised as well as how easily he got that wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 5(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Narine Run Out!! Narine is horrible when it comes to running between the wickets. Just pathetic I must say. {{BATSMAN}} should have been aware of it. Just tickles the ball to short fine and rushes for a quick single. Narine had to respond. Thakur underarms the throw and then the MS special. Good game awareness. Just deflects the ball onto the stumps with sheer ease. Narine run out (SN Thakur/Dhoni) 16(11) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Vinay Kumar!! That's a soft dismissal and {{BOWLER}} blows a kiss to the batsman on his way to the dressing room. In trying to fetch another boundary, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the fancy looking reverse sweep and completely mistimes it. Get a top edge and it flies slowly to short third man. A great opportunity wasted by {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Vinay Kumar b {{BOWLER}} 4(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! {{BOWLER}} is thrilled to bits and he totally deserves all of it. A full inswinger and {{BATSMAN}}'s lack of feet movement meant he chipped the drive straight down the throat of Kohli at mid-off. Came right off the cue end. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! Second in the over for {{BOWLER}}! What a game he is having! A blitzing cameo earlier in the night and now two strikes with the ball. Pounded this on the hard length with good pace, {{BATSMAN}} was backing away for the slash but got done in by the speed. Too late and gets a healthy nick that's pouched by a beaming de Kock. Wheels coming off for {{TEAM}}. Not far away from hearing the fat lady sing. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rinku Singh!! {{BATSMAN}} goes for the slog-sweep and holes out at deep midwicket. Considering spin has done all the damage so far, and that this is {{BOWLER}}'s final over, this isn't the smartest shot. He doesn't connect as well as he would've wanted, and gives Rinku Singh a simple catch in the deep. {{BATSMAN}} c Rinku Singh b {{BOWLER}} 11(11) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! Nothing shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Goes back to cut a googly that is not short by any stretch of imagination. Gets a thick edge and Rohit {{BOWLER}} is catching everything tonight. How can he drop something destined to go into his lap!? {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 0(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Much needed breakthrough for the hosts. {{BOWLER}} comes on and strikes first ball. Not a big turner of the ball, this bloke, and that skiddiness through the surface accounts for {{BATSMAN}}. May have been the googly. Pushed through the air, lands it on a length, and the ball zips through the gate as {{BATSMAN}} tries to loft it on the up. He was aiming for the inside-out shot with the turn. But the ball goes straight on and knocks over middle and off. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 28(19) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Oh beautifully bowled. That's won{{BATSMAN}}rful {{BATSMAN}}ception in flight. He slows it down, gives it some air to lure {{BATSMAN}} out of his crease and then gets it to dip and turn past him. {{BATSMAN}} runs past the ball. Lovely. Easy stumping for Jadhav. {{BATSMAN}} st Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 31(28) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Nobody's taking his catches, and so what if he needs to sprint backwards for this. Yeah, he does. {{BATSMAN}}, third time unlucky, has a dance, a hoick, only getting the toe-end and skewing up a skier. It's somewhere around mid-on, and the run-dive's more than good enough. But forget that, it's been a top knock from India's best number four who wasn't in the World Cup. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 71(48) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! {{BATSMAN}} walks! Slower short delivery, {{BATSMAN}} early into the pull shot, gets a thick edge that lobs in front of Pant who dives forward to complete the catch. This is so good from DC. Oh a bit of glove love between KG and Jadeja too. Nice to see. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 15(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! Easy peasy. McCullum makes it look so easy. The slower delivery right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} spotted it and went on one knee to smash it out of the ground, did not get the elevation and hits it to long-on. McCullum first reverse cups it, but the momentum was taking him over, tosses the ball up, comes back in and completes the formalities. {{BATSMAN}} c Brendon McCullum b {{BOWLER}} 9(16)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rayudu!! Ends a troubled stay. Without getting his timing right, {{BATSMAN}} tries an uppish loft. Doesn't bother moving his feet though. Doesn't bother reaching out as well. Doesn't even bother to read the slower one. Stands, swings, toe-ends and mid-off does the rest. Kolkata innings falling apart. More to their own self-ignition. {{BATSMAN}} c Rayudu b {{BOWLER}} 2(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}}'s been trapped in front but he walks down the pitch to have a chat with Raina in quest for a review but nope, the Southpaw advises him against going for the review and off he goes. Eden explodes. {{BOWLER}} picks up his second wicket and he's keeping KKR in the game. Such a vital wicket this because {{BATSMAN}} was looking ominous. Quicker delivery, skidded through after pitching and KJ misjudged it, ended up playing it down the wrong line and it pings him on the front pad. HawkEye's in and it says the ball is crashing the leg-stump. Good call from umpire Rod Tucker. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 20(12) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Grandhomme!! The swirler has been taken at deep fine leg, inches inside the fence. The batsman shuffled across the sticks and swept the ball away high up in the air. The ball went skywards and when it came down, it had a nervous Kiwi under it. The fielder took it really away from his body. He was inches inside the fence though and that played on his mind. {{BATSMAN}} c de Grandhomme b {{BOWLER}} 81(42) [4s-7 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Looked like the knuckle ball. Banged in on a back of a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} looked to pull and chops an inside edge onto his stumps. Another pretty Karun {{BATSMAN}} innings that cries for more deliveries at the crease. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 31(23) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Just too good. It is hard enough for a proper batsman to pick {{BOWLER}}, imagine how hard it would be for an Australian all-rounder. {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the wicket without knowing what delivery it is, the wrong 'un spins in and sneaks past the swinging blade before crashing into the stumps. A well-deserved wicket for {{BOWLER}}, who has bowled brilliantly without any luck. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 9(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Ah! {{BATSMAN}} Sharma and his struggles against spinners this season. Oh wait! There seems to have a big inside edge. Yes there is. Gets down low to sweep {{BOWLER}} past square leg, edged and onto the pads. Looked close to the naked eye, just that the umpire didn't pick the edge. {{BATSMAN}} Sharma walks back disappointed. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The quickish flattish leggie does it for {{BOWLER}}. That beat {{BATSMAN}} on the outer edge as he looked to punch it and missed it for the off pole to be disturbed. The young man has a huge scalp. The partnership was building and has been broken now. Punjab get an important wicket to stop the momentum. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 20(21) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Take a bow Gautam Gambhir. It was a brave move to bowl {{BOWLER}} and he is now reaping the rewards. Two wickets in the over. One of Dhoni and the other of the in-form {{BATSMAN}}. The wrong 'un keeps bamboozling the batsmen, {{BATSMAN}} like others does not pick, lunges forward to work it into the leg-side, missed and beaten comprehensively. Uthappa takes his time to remove the bails, but does so in the nick of time. {{BATSMAN}}'s back leg was on the line and he didn't even attempt to get it back in. {{BATSMAN}} st Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! {{BATSMAN}} comes and goes. Without scoring. Cleverly bowled by {{BOWLER}}, saw {{BATSMAN}} charging out, pulled his length back, {{BATSMAN}} skies the lofted hit straight up and Pant calls for it to take it. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rutherford!! {{BATSMAN}} will find the fielder. He is disappointed with himself. But cheer up young man, you have just played a special innings for your team. It was on a fuller length again, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to dispatch it over long-off, he wasn't balanced at the point of contact. And lost his shape, it comes off the bottom half of the willow and Rutherford makes no mistake at long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Rutherford b {{BOWLER}} 50(49) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} is leaving the Lions flummoxed. This was the wrong 'un, pitched just outside off and spun back into the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} didn't read it one bit, played for the straighter one, beaten on the inside edge and struck bang in front of middle. The height wasn't an issue, the ball would have been crashing into the leg-stump. Easy call for the umpire and Gujarat Lions slip into further trouble. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Warner!! Chennai in trouble as they've lost almost half of their side. {{BOWLER}} strikes in his first over. Played a handy cameo a few days ago and strikes right away today. Tempts the batsman with a loopy legbreak around off and {{BATSMAN}} chips it straight to the SRH skipper at covers. Good reflexes shown by Warner as he completes the catch and isn't he delighted? {{BATSMAN}} c Warner b {{BOWLER}} 3(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Rajpoot Run Out!! 1 run completed. {{TEAM}} have been bowled out for 88. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to keep the strike and pushed Rajpoot for a non-existent second. In fact, it was Rajpoot who wanted the second. {{BATSMAN}} worked the flatter delivery towards wide long-on, he was content with the single but upon seeing Rajpoot charge across, he relcutantly went for it, nice flat throw right next to the stumps from Southee and Mo did the rest. Rajpoot run out (Southee/{{BOWLER}}) 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nitish Rana!! The dangerous one is gone and the crowd go wild. {{BOWLER}} is delighted. {{BATSMAN}} sees the width outside off on this short of length delivery and slashes hard. Doesn't get enough elevation and finds Nitish Rana at backward point, who jumps and takes a good catch. {{BATSMAN}} departs without troubling the scorers. {{BATSMAN}} c Nitish Rana b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! Wow. Wow. Three wickets in quick time and suddenly the score isn't looking that great. High full toss, was meant to be hit for six but {{BATSMAN}} mistimed that and looked like it was falling in front of the fielder, but Hooda came in and snaffled that low and diving forward. {{BOWLER}} can't contain his smile. Can't believe his luck either. DK just puts his head down in disappointment, unable to believe the shot he played. {{BATSMAN}} c Deepak Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! Something had to give and it is a wicket. The sea of red flags flutter around the Chinnaswamy. Another set batsmen doesn't bat through the innings. Nice loop on this leggie, {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes lit up and he went to send it into the second tier, cleared his front leg to heave and mistimed it towards long-on. The ball hung in the air for a long time before AB reverse cupped it calmly. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 25(28) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gambhir!! {{BOWLER}} gets his man after missing those two chances. But take a moment to stand and applaud this man. Great to see many KKR players go up to {{BATSMAN}} and congratulate him for his knock. Slower delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the slog, mistimes it completely, the ball goes high in the air towards cover. Gambhir settles under it, the ball almost pops out of his hands but he manages to hold on. The crowd give their skipper a grand ovation. So Gayle's 175 is safe! {{BATSMAN}} c Gambhir b {{BOWLER}} 126(59) [4s-10 6s-8]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Ouch! {{BATSMAN}} is limping off the field. DK helped his state mate compose himself. He was struck on the right knee. Length delivery right on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} with a cleared front leg missed the slog to the on-side, hit flush on the back knee in front of middle. The umpire took a while before raising his finger, but he made the right decision. {{BATSMAN}} grunted in pain after the blow and was on his haunches for a bit. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 45(22) [4s-4 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! A low full toss at 119kph, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the lofted on-drive. Doesn't get the required elevation and Pollard takes a calm catch at long-on. Mumbai Indian win by 46 runs! {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 22(20) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Yea, yea, declare it, {{BOWLER}}' IPL. An off-spinner this, giving an impression that's it's a juicy leg-stump-line, but {{BATSMAN}}'s undone by the lack of pace on this, going way too early with his flick, only to miss it big time and let the ball ricochet off his pads onto the off-stump. Okay he's 19, but it needs to be said, {{BATSMAN}}'s made a mess here. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 34(36) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} has been given out lbw off {{BOWLER}}. {{TEAM}} review: Fair delivery, looks to be pitching in line and no bat involved. Umpire's call on hitting and he has to go. Hasn't been at his fluent best and this shot is a firm proof of that. Just looks to slog without having a real sense of where the ball pitched and he loses his shape in the process, swings way too early and {{BOWLER}}'s floaty legbreak clonks him in front of middle. Technology shows it to be brushing the leg bail. Just enough. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 13(13) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! A bowler always has the last laugh. One of those things. {{BATSMAN}} is gone. {{BOWLER}} gets him, not sure how big that one will be. But at least it's a dot ball and a wicket. Another off-pace ball that is going across {{BATSMAN}}. He tries the cross-batted swing, slices it in the air. Parthiv Patel runs forward towards his left. Has to stretch a bit to snaffle this one. {{BATSMAN}} c Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 25(16) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal {{BOWLER}}!! Caught by Senior {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} combusts. Had to go for it simply; full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was backing away and had to reach out for it. Threw his bat and lost his shape. Slices it up in the air to short third man. The ball was swirling and Krunal judges it well to hold onto it without much fuss. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(7) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Negi!! First time {{BOWLER}} has opened the bowling this season and he has got the big wicket of {{BATSMAN}}. Just the start RCB wanted especially after an expensive over from Udana. {{BATSMAN}} had enough of defending and was looking to go for the biggie, the length was fraction short and he was quick to pounce, pulls it high and that would have gone the distance in any other ground but not in Dubai, Negi settles under it at deep mid-wicket and hangs on comfortably. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Negi b {{BOWLER}} 8(8) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Barinder!! So damn ungainly. {{BATSMAN}} sheds his grace, well you have to when you are chasing 200, ends up one-handed. So it was the knuckle ball, {{BOWLER}}'s staple, {{BATSMAN}} gets down the track in trying to dispatch it into long-off. Loses shape, loses timing, and Sran's there at mid-off, waiting to gobble up the skier. {{BATSMAN}} c Barinder b {{BOWLER}} 12(10) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! {{BOWLER}}ji is turning it on at Kotla. He will be on a hat-trick. It was a leggie wide of off, it spins away, clips the outside edge of {{BATSMAN}} who was probably playing for the wrong 'un. It clips his outside edge and Pant takes it with ease. Golden duck for {{BATSMAN}}!{{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw! Doesn't even wait to review! Angles it across after pitching in on leg and middle, straightens, does the leg-spinner, and {{BATSMAN}} is trapped on the backfoot, trying to tuck across the line - but the whippy action and the lack of backspin means that it will hurry on and he is trapped in front. He's on his way back after an impressive cameo up top. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 20(10) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Abhishek Sharma! 120.9km/h, a slower bouncer on the body, the off-cutter, the easiest of all slower balls, and he foxes {{BATSMAN}}. Early into the pull, induces the top-edge as the ball goes high in the air towards deep backward square leg and Abhishek Sharma rushes in to take an impressive catch diving forward. {{BATSMAN}} c Abhishek Sharma b {{BOWLER}} 10(9) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Finch!! {{BATSMAN}} will now know that this is a big, big ground. Steps out to a slower delivery -- knuckle ball, actually -- but can you blame him? Mistimes this attempted loft and there's long-off waiting, secretly thanking the big dimensions that this ground entails. {{BATSMAN}} c Finch b {{BOWLER}} 54(41) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Now he's set him up beautifully. Fired the last one flatter and quicker, and bowls this loopier. {{BATSMAN}}, to his credit, looked to have middled it - well, it sounded like that - but he finds the deep mid-wicket fielder like how you would when things aren't going your way. A struggle of an innings, coming on the day KKR least required it. Where from here for KKR? {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 12(15) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! Has this been taken? KL and {{BOWLER}} are ready to celebrate but umpire Nitin Menon pauses them, he isn't sure if the catch is clean. So, they are referring it to the third umpire. {{BATSMAN}} is also asked to wait. No doubt about the glove, it's all about the catch. It's dipping on the way to Rahul and seems like he's grabbed it cleanly. OUT is the decision and the batsman can continue his walk back to the hut. Delhi are falling away quickly. A back of a length, veering down leg. Patel wanted to tickle it fine and he ended up gloving it to KLR, who went to his right and took a good low catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 6(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! He does it again, {{BOWLER}}! Bowls tight, builds pressure and forces the mistake. Such as asset he's turned out to be for Dhoni and Co. This is an inswinging short of length {{BATSMAN}}livery, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to smash this to the mid-wicket boundary as the runs weren't coming, the bat turned in his hands as he slogged at this and it went straight to square leg. {{BOWLER}} roars in {{BATSMAN}}light. Mind you, QdK is in great form and it's not easy to keep him calm. {{BATSMAN}} c Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 4(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! That has happened all evening long. Flatter outside off, stopped and bounced on the batter, {{BATSMAN}} goes through with his punch and hits it back to the bowler. {{BOWLER}} does his celebratory run. CSK get a quick second wicket. But they need a horde of them now to even think of making a match of it from here. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} never looked comfortable against {{BOWLER}}. Looks to loft over long-on, {{BOWLER}} spots his intentions and held his length back slightly, it drifts in slowly with great amount of dip to slide and slip into the leg peg. Brilliant work. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(15)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! Another soft dismissal. {{BOWLER}} has his second and DC are pressing the advantage home here. Pacy full ball on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} goes that favorite aerial flick of his. Only that this time, there is a deep square leg in place for such kind of an adventure. Dhawan gobbles it up and gives his signature thigh slap. {{BOWLER}} was brought to break this potentially threatening pair and he does precisely that, although Russell is still there. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shami!! There's the sucker-punch. {{BOWLER}}'s the partnership breaker. This should soothe some nerves in the KXIP camp. Went shorter and cramped {{BATSMAN}} for room, he tried it help it fine but ended up hitting it straight to Shami at 45 - who gobbles it up. Fine innings from {{BATSMAN}} comes to an end. {{BOWLER}} spotted that the batsmen didn't cross, so alerts the umpire about the same. Smarty! {{BATSMAN}} c Shami b {{BOWLER}} 53(38) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Krunal takes a good running catch! A seam-up short ball and {{BATSMAN}} had to go after it. Looks to pull/heave it away and was a touch late on the shot. Gets it off the lower part of the bat. No timing, whatsoever. Krunal runs in from deep mid-wicket, keeps watching the ball, dives forward to complete a superb catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sandeep Sharma!! Dravid looks distraught in the dug-out as another batsman self combusts. Can't blame {{BATSMAN}} though, DD needed some quick runs, but there's nothing coming today. This was short and wide of off, asking to be smacked. {{BATSMAN}} had the right idea, he was looking to crack it over point, but the execution went all awry. Ends up getting too underneath the ball and flat-bats it in the air, Sandeep circled around the skier from cover. Thought about going reverse cupped, decides against it and takes it in the normal way. {{BATSMAN}} c Sandeep Sharma b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Gets him with a peach of an inswinger. Full and swinging in towards middle and off, {{BATSMAN}} looks to flick over mid-wicket and plays all around it. Gets completely beaten by the inward movement and the woodwork is all over the place.{{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Edged and taken. All those bowlers in the CPL, hope you note this length. Back of a length is the toughest to hit. If you have pace, it's a no brainer for you to use at the death to power-hitters than bowling freebies in the name of trying the fancied yorker, for which the margin of error is very less. {{BATSMAN}} slogs and gets a thick outside edge through to Dhoni. CSK have stolen 10 runs off the total. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 18(14) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Smith!! That's a poor shot, real horror of a shot. Very very lazy from KP. Steve Smith Stationed himself at short mid-wicket lurking for an opportunity, he was waiting for that brain-fade moment from the big man. And it didn't take long. A languid flick, no real intent on the shot, just playing it in more of hope. It went flat and low to the right of Smudge who had it covered with his bucket hands. {{BATSMAN}} c Smith b {{BOWLER}} 7(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! Dhawan has claimed a catch. {{BATSMAN}} isn't going anywhere. The third umpire will have a look, the soft call is OUT. He has caught it cleanly, but has the ball touched the ground or did Dhawan get his fingers underneath it? The zoomer has been called for, it looks tricky, but the soft signal is OUT. If there's no conclusive evidence, it will stay with the on-field call. The third umpire is taking numerous looks at it. B2$ is the call. GL have lost two of their overseas batting stars now. Coming to the ball, it was banged short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was rocking back on the pull, went low of the bat and looped towards mid-wicket. The ball was dying in front of him, but Dhawan does well to dive forward and holds onto it. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 31(21) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! Here comes the leading edge. The {{BOWLER}} slower one on this sticky wicket finally consumes a wicket for Mumbai - too late in the day one would reckon. After a few checked defences, {{BATSMAN}} looks to pile on the angle coming in off a fullish length as he turns his bat looking to flick it away. A balloon to extra cover, who snatches it from the hands of mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 44(35) [4s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}}'s out lbw. Another review from {{TEAM}}: Legal delivery and there seems to be no bat involved. Has it done too much though, the googly? He's struck in line with off and there's another umpire's call on hitting. Shaving the top of leg peg. OUT!! A rather simple set-up this from {{BOWLER}}, bowled the wrong 'un and gave it ample flight to draw {{BATSMAN}} on the front foot. The batsman clearly didn't pick the variation and his forward stride meant he was struck adjacent to middle and leg. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! In the air and taken. Straight to Pollard at cover-point, who juggles a bit and holds onto it. Both openers back in the shed for {{TEAM}} and it's been a wonderful start for Mumbai. Short and well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} cuts and doesn't keep it down. Hits it airly and finds Pollard, who leaps and it bobbled out of his hands, but he keeps his calm and grabs it on the second attempt. Wankhede explodes.. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 5(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} had taken a couple of brilliant decisions this season, but this was an absolute disaster. Dream of a delivery from {{BOWLER}}, his confidence was high after taking Gayle and he gives this ball ample air; the ball turned, gripped and went through the bat-pad gap of {{BATSMAN}}. Ash was trying to mow across the line and it ended up looking silly. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Plumb. {{BATSMAN}}'s caught on the crease and {{BOWLER}} is chuffed to bits. Pitches this on a length and gets just the right amount of turn into the left-han{{BATSMAN}}r, {{BATSMAN}}'s stran{{BATSMAN}}d on the back foot and that's crashing into middle and leg. Played all around it and paid the price. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 40(26) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The middle stump has been planted into its grave. That might be it as far as {{TEAM}}'s hopes go. {{BATSMAN}} moves a mile to the off-side and {{BOWLER}} keeps it full and straight and fast. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 18(8) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Moeen Ali Run Out!! Make it five down now. I'm pretty sure that Moeen is short of his ground, his bat is in the air and he already looks downcast. Well short, Moeen is OUT. Oh dear, {{TEAM}} are batting and now running like senseless chickens. On a good length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} clipped it towards mid-wicket and took a start, that prompted Moeen Ali to make a dash, sent back late - too late though - Nabi shies and misses, sandeep has time to break the stumps with the batsman well short. Moeen Ali run out (Nabi/{{BOWLER}}) 2(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Gone! {{BOWLER}} has struck in his first over. As often is the case, lapse in concentration for {{BATSMAN}}. Hits the deck on a shortish length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to pull it, he had to fetch it from outside off. He came down a step and wanted to smack the leather off it. All he could do was manifest a faint nick to the keeper. PP went up straightaway and {{BOWLER}} joined him late. Hushed silence in the crowd. The umpires checked for a possible no-ball but his foot was way behind the crease. {{BATSMAN}} c Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 22(27) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Chops on. 123kph. Back of a length. Angling across. {{BATSMAN}} swings in a cut of sorts. Is early. And under-edges onto timber. And much like these stop-start sentences, Rajasthan have stopped before they started. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 38(29) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! And he strikes first ball! What a great asset he has been for Mumbai Indians this season. This is a big, big wicket and a wicket that Mumbai needed badly. {{BATSMAN}} was on the back foot expecting some short stuff, wasn't to be. {{BOWLER}} spears in a full one that keeps tailing in to hit {{BATSMAN}} on the back pad. Dead in front. {{BATSMAN}} was looking to play straight...oh wait! Snicko shows that he seem to have got a faint inside edge on that. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 6(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Floors middle stump yet again. Has he stepped up today or what?! Exceptional from {{BOWLER}}, and even Shardul. He's slowed this up beautifully and {{BATSMAN}} is through his slog too early. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shami!! Low full toss and it's been chipped off the toe-end to Shami at mid-off who gathers the ball after a slight fumble on the first attempt. I'm afraid this is all but over for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Shami b {{BOWLER}} 3(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Straight down the throat of sweeper cover. {{BATSMAN}} is gutted, can't believe his luck. Another instance of not converting a start from SKY as {{BOWLER}} gets his second wicket. It was pitched fuller and SKY made room slightly and bent low, slapped it firmly. It was flat and went straight to Rashid in the deep, who gleefully accepts it. SRH anthem blares in the background. {{BATSMAN}} c Rashid Khan b {{BOWLER}} 23(17) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Morris!! The old warhorse gets his second wicket. {{BATSMAN}}'s poor form continues. He was scarced for runs, wanted to throw caution to the winds but doesn't succeed. Went for a on-the-up drive to a good length delivery that probably kicked up a touch. It was the slower ball from {{BOWLER}} that did the trick. He slices it straight to extra-cover, who took a couple of steps back and held onto it. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Morris b {{BOWLER}} 20(18) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Through 'im! Carrom ball from round the wicket this, and it spins in to cleave {{BATSMAN}} into two. He's trying to clip it through mid-wicket, doesn't have his head around this variation (or {{BOWLER}}'s stock ball?) and succumbs. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Williamson!! This is just a culmination of what was brewing. {{BOWLER}}'s getting the ball to drift away, {{BATSMAN}}'s throwing his bat and getting lucky. Not this time. Off the toe-end, there's Williamson at wide long-on, having covered some ground from mid-wicket and tumbling behind to take this one. Lovely catch. He's on fire in the field, is Williamson, this IPL. {{BATSMAN}} c Williamson b {{BOWLER}} 9(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Jaddu throws it away. Should have showed some maturity with his team a travelling in troubled ship, not to be. Sinks to one knee, slog-sweeps from outside off and top-edges it high into the air. The bowler calls for it and accepts gleefully. Gujarat Lions sink further into the mire. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 28(21) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Navdeep Saini!! Gets him this time! {{BOWLER}} once again lures {{BATSMAN}} with the flight and the attempted loft doesn't find the middle, skews it off the bottom half of the bat and offers catching practice to the fielder at long-off. More pressure on Bairstow now... {{BATSMAN}} c Navdeep Saini b {{BOWLER}} 34(33) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Whatta delivery! Between the legs and the bat to rattle the sticks. {{BOWLER}} guns down {{BATSMAN}} here. Back-to-back wickets for RCB and {{BOWLER}}. Inch-perfect yorker with the new nut. Chinnaswamy erupts as well. RCB fans have found their voices again. Game on! {{BOWLER}}, what an inspiration. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! A big heave and {{BATSMAN}} has missed it completely - the leg-stump is on the ground and {{BOWLER}} continues to be impressive. The knuckle ball, pitched on off and kept coming back with the angle, {{BATSMAN}} backed away on a mighty heave and missed - stumps in a mess and so are the Royals' hopes of getting to 150. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 28(26) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! No such luck for {{BATSMAN}}. The short ball is banged in slow. The batsman tried to fetch it from outside off and only manages to sky it up in the air. The man from deep mid - Rahane charges in and takes it easily. Pune need 130 to win! {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 47(38) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! Don't know what to say about this from {{BATSMAN}}. I'm speechless. Last ball of the powerplay and he has gifted his wicket away. Didn't try to take advantage early in the over, decides to do off the last ball and pays the price. Backed away to smash it over cover, just horribly mistimed it to extra cover. That's another big blow to {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Maxwell!! Pace off the ball gets {{BATSMAN}}. It's an off-cutter bowled on a back of length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} tries to flat-bat it down the ground but he's not in control of the shot and slices it up in the air to mid-off. Relief for Punjab. {{BATSMAN}} c Maxwell b {{BOWLER}} 37(18) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Oopsy! Why would you swipe across the line from a good length on this pitch. Made it look as if it stayed low. The scrambled seam delivery and the ball ignited the stumps after beating the ugly swipe from the batsman. Dan Vettori gestures to someone to go out now from the dugout. Okay, it's Sarfaraz! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 13(14) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tahir!! {{BOWLER}} is on his way with those celebrations, shaking it real nice. Completely deceived {{BATSMAN}} with this slower ball. It was a short of length delivery well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to drag it away through the on-side. But by the time it arrived, he had completely lost his shape. The top-edge balloons towards short third man where Tahir moves a few yards back and settles under it comfortably. {{BATSMAN}} c Tahir b {{BOWLER}} 22(17) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya! {{BATSMAN}}'s gotta go! Doesn't quite have Buttler's bottom-hand, and with the pace off, he's tried to club this with a dominant bottom-hand over long-on - doesn't get much distance, and Hardik runs in from wide long-on to comfortably hold on to a catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 15(16) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! The early pressure has resulted in the fall of {{BATSMAN}}. This was a back of a length delivery on the stumps, it was the slower one as well. {{BATSMAN}} was in no position on the pull, went high off the bat and lobbed towards Shardul at mid-on. He runs forward and accepts the catch gleefully. Just the start {{TEAM}} wanted - they have been on the dot and created the pressure on the batsmen. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Simran Singh!! {{BOWLER}} draws first blood! Was a quickish slider and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to pull across the line. Got a tiny under edge and Simran Singh who had looked awful initially, held on to a brilliant catch. The fun part began after this, because the appeal for caught behind wasn't given at first. As KXIP were about to review, the umpire raised his finger but {{BATSMAN}} didn't probably see that. He was standing with Warner, which made it seem like he wanted the review. It seems like he wasn't clear of the decision and once it was clarified, he walked away {{BATSMAN}} c Simran Singh b {{BOWLER}} 28(13) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! {{BOWLER}} is on fire. This is a jaffa to remove the KKR captain. A typical {{BOWLER}} wicket. Pounds it hard at 147.3kph on back of a length and gets it to straighten a tad, just a tad and {{BATSMAN}} ended up playing the wrong line, the outside edge settled nicely into Buttler's mitts. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} is on all fours and on the ground, but he has a wicket first-ball. This is as plumb as it gets, {{BATSMAN}} is gutted with himself as he walks back to the hut, didn't even consider reviewing it, it was as dead as one gets. Coming to the ball, this was nicely floated around middle, a hint of shape and that was enough to beat the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} was shaping for the sweep, the ball was too full for that, he missed and was struck on the back-thigh, adjacent to middle-stump. It was going to crash into middle and umpire Nitin Menon has one of the easier LBW decisions of his career. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 34(24) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! PACE.FULL.STRAIGHT. Always a deadly combination against the lower order batters. A 143ks thunderbolt from {{BOWLER}} and the middle pole is absolutely hammered. Bhuvi plays a nothing shot as he tries to slog across the line and only swishes thin air. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! Dropped him twice, conceded a six and finally {{BOWLER}} removes {{BATSMAN}}. Much-needed breakthrough. The West Indian perishes trying to deposit another one into the stands. The length was on the shorter side and {{BATSMAN}} was a touch early to swing his bat. He wanted to go over deep mid-wicket, ended up lofting it to long-on. Bravo won't drop those. Yet another important knock from {{BATSMAN}}. He's done his job. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Bravo b {{BOWLER}} 32(20) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rajpoot!! Deceived him with the slower short ball there. It never arrived. {{BATSMAN}} decided to go for the pull and he fails to arrest the momentum, ends up feeding the top-edge and offers a dolly of a catch to Rajpoot at short fine. {{BATSMAN}} c Rajpoot b {{BOWLER}} 32(23) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! There's the jig from DJ. CSK fans will start practicing that. {{TEAM}} lose their fifth wicket, with 10 overs still left. It was hurled fuller outside off and {{BATSMAN}} goes hard on the drive. The bat turned at the point of impact and he ended up slicing it to backward point off the bottom part of the bat. Bravo won't drop those. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Bravo b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Oh that's out. What beautiful shape from {{BOWLER}}. Floats it up, curls it back in and hits {{BATSMAN}} on the pad as he plays right across the line. That's plumb in front of middle. He set him up beautifully with the previous {{BOWLER}}livery angled across. The crowds are shouting their throats hoarse. Electrifying at the E{{BOWLER}}n Gar{{BOWLER}}ns. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! That's a spectacular return catch from {{BOWLER}}, but {{BATSMAN}} isn't going anywhere. The third umpire has been called for and the soft signal is OUT. That's as clean as one gets, the decision remains OUT. The Mohali crowd go bonkers as their southern neighbours lose another. Credit must go to the bowler here, he was on his followthrough, bent down low, went with his left hand and pouched a beauty. Coming to the ball, it was a short of a good length delivery outside off, might have stopped on the batsman. {{BATSMAN}} was early into the drive, went low off the bat and to the left of {{BOWLER}}. He moved across on his followthrough, with one-handed and the ball stuck, made sure that it didn't pop out when his elbows hit the ground. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 6(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Maxwell!! {{BOWLER}} is pumping his fist and punching the air. Three wickets in that over and just one run off it. Fantastic effort from the leggie. {{BATSMAN}} too like Chawla charges the bowler and can only find long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Maxwell b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} tosses this up and lands it far enough from {{BATSMAN}} to make him reach out for the slog. The ball turns, takes a thick leading edge and lobs up. {{BOWLER}} doesn't leave it for anyone else, he runs backwards and grabs it so well. Made it look easy there. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Hoodwinked by the wrong 'un. No heroics from {{BATSMAN}} then, who stormed to IPL's fastest fifty at this very ground in the league stage. Shimmies out ambitiously but {{BOWLER}}'s bowling in the powerplay for a reason. Sees him doing that, bowls a tossed-up googly and gets him stumped. Easy take for the keeper and a disparaging flick of the bails. {{BATSMAN}} st Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 10(10) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! Excellent running catch from Unadkat. Ran all the way from short fine and caught this around the backward square area with a splendid dive. Bhuvi just chipped a back of the hand slower ball without any conviction and then the theatrics from Unadkat, the fielder. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! Now he goes uppish, hits it flat and hard, and finds long-off. {{BOWLER}} is off celebrating in some part of Chepauk, while {{BATSMAN}} is left to rue his choice of shot, not for the first time this season - an area where he has a long ways to go yet. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Bravo b {{BOWLER}} 5(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That's the problem of being rooted to the crease. Never one to use his front foot well to the spinners, loves to play off the back foot. If {{BOWLER}} spotted that and deliberately fired this in on a good length, then full credit to him. Ill-advised flick off the back foot and that too off balance when he was trying shift back. Off the pad and into the sticks. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 12(12) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Gone! That is the problem with {{BATSMAN}}. He will give you those cute little 30s and 40s but never a man for a big innings. Nothing but a leg-break with a hint of turn, {{BATSMAN}} stays flat-footed and has a poke at it, very casual in his approach and the ball finds a feather of the outside edge. Pant does well to hold on to the catch as it almost popped out. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 39(29) [4s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Woakes!! Real quick. Talk about timing even when you are getting out. {{BATSMAN}} backs away, smacks it down long-on's throat. And it's so flat that Pandya can't even cross over. {{BATSMAN}} c Woakes b {{BOWLER}} 94(52) [4s-10 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! First breakthrough for DC and it's a big one. {{BATSMAN}} chops this onto his stumps. A 134.2ks inswinger from {{BOWLER}}, managed to pitch it on a good length and that sharp inward movement meant {{BATSMAN}} played it slightly outside the line of the delivery (he was trying to flick on the leg-side) and the timber's been rattled. Takes the inside edge and hammers the woodwork. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 21(19) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nitish Rana!! {{BOWLER}} has bowled very well tonight and gets the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} out. To the left-hander he has been bowling mainly googlies and this one is the same as well. {{BATSMAN}} was charging {{BOWLER}} and it kept on going away from him. Sliced it high up in the air and Rana backtracking from cover takes a good catch. Not easy to judge that in the lights. {{BATSMAN}} c Nitish Rana b {{BOWLER}} 14(11) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Sweet sound of timber! {{BATSMAN}} walks down the wicket to play this but {{BOWLER}} slips in yorker and nails it to perfection. The batsman couldn't do nothing there as the middle stump was uprooted. Is there a twist in the tale? Surely not! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 19(9) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Mo has deserved this wicket. The promotion to send {{BATSMAN}} up the order does not work for {{TEAM}}. The offie kept it simple, pushed it through and attacked the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} tries a cheeky reverse sweep and is beaten for pace, struck right in front of the stumps and the umpire had no doubt. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Simmons!! You got to look at {{BATSMAN}}. He cannot believe it. Looks dejected. As if has been robbed of hope. The scoreboard pressure gets the better of him. A shortish ball that he tries to help with the pull, does not quite manoeuvre it well. Ends up hitting in the air at deep mid-wicket. The fielder onrushes a few yards and accepts the offer. {{BATSMAN}} c Simmons b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} is doing what he's been asked to. Bowls the wrong 'un and catches {{BATSMAN}} by surprise; no clue. Knocked him over. {{BATSMAN}} was prodding forward to drive, thought it was a conventional legbreak, wasn't to be. The ball lands on a good length and snakes in viciously to sneak through the bat-pad gate. RCB couldn't have asked for a better start. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 12(9) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kuldeep Yadav! An abomination fo a shot for an Indian Test opener. {{BATSMAN}} backs away into the on-side, picks up a length ball from middle-stump, 145.7km/h, and tries to run his hands through the ball in chipping it over mid-off, miscues and and ends up lobbing it straight to the man at mid-off, succumbing in a rather soft manner. That was pressure. Pressure talking. {{BATSMAN}} c Kuldeep Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Dragged on! First ball wicket for {{BOWLER}}. And it is the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} who has been sent back. He lets out an ooh as he sees the stumps disturbed. Back of a length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stays leg-side of the ball to carve it through off, but the slow nature of the surface does not get the ball quickly to him and hence the inside edge onto the stumps. Much needed wicket for RR. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 12(9) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!!Gone! There's the breakthrough and is that the opening CSK were looking for? Game on. What a catch that was from Jaddu. It was a shortish ball and {{BATSMAN}} struck it pretty well. Went back in his crease to pull and got it off middle of the bat. But, in comes Ravindra Jadeja, CSK's best fielder. Sprinted across to his left from deep mid-wicket, had his eyes on the ball and slided to snaffle with both hands. Bhajji runs towards the fielder to applaud the effort. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 44(34) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ashwin!! The {{TEAM}} supporters look stunned as the captain departs. That's a poor looking shot from KW, but it was the extra bounce that was his undoing. Banged in short and a hint of away movement from outside off, KW was in a terrible position as he went for the pull, would have been better had he tried to cut, gets a top-edge that lobbed in the air and Ashwin has a simple catch at mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Ashwin b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Uthappa!! Wonderful delivery. This time it has taken the edge, has it? Yes. These might well be familiar conditions for {{BOWLER}}, given the freshness in the wicket and the way it's zipping through the surface. He's found his rhythm from the get-go. Short of length, nips away a touch and squares {{BATSMAN}} up to take a feather through to the keeper. KKR routing {{TEAM}} pretty bad. {{BATSMAN}} c Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 8(9) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by A Russell!! Good catch by Russell at short cover. Leapt at the right time to catch. {{BATSMAN}} went inside out but couldn't keep the in-to-out shot down, bit more elevation and he would've got a couple at least. {{BATSMAN}} c A Russell b {{BOWLER}} 15(11) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! This was always coming! {{BATSMAN}} was looking to slog everything out of the park, on a good length and just outside off, might have been the slower ball, {{BATSMAN}} swung through the line, went off the toe-end of the bat, got plenty of height but not the distance. Kohli ran across to his left from long-on and held on to a simple catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 7(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Williamson!! Now then, is there a change in the tale? SRH are masters at staging comebacks from nowhere. Don't write them off yet. Short of a length delivery it was from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to play across the line, but he ended up slicing it towards mid-off, hit high on the bat, Kane ran to his left from extra-cover and put in the dive to complete the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Williamson b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} has been given out LBW, he reviews. No issues with the front foot. Clearly no bat there. Only factor that could favour {{BATSMAN}} is the height. Hit in-line as well. Ball-tracker is out: 2 reds. Pitched - in-line. Impact - in-line. Wickets - umpire's call. Clipping the top of middle. What a fightback from SRH this has been. Skiddy leg-break from {{BOWLER}} on a short of length, {{BATSMAN}} went back for the pull and it didn't rise much as he expected. Misses and is rapped on the back thigh. Was given out on-field, he reviewed in hope but in vain. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 18(19) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rayudu!! He was put un{{BATSMAN}}r pressure by {{BATSMAN}} in this over and he has respon{{BATSMAN}}d in the best possible fashion with a wicket. Quality of a champion bowler. It was a well-disguised slower {{BATSMAN}}livery, {{BATSMAN}} was totally taken aback by it. His bat swing came down much much early, it clipped his top-edge and went straight up in the air. Rayudu with the gloves takes it with ease. And {{BOWLER}} picks up his mandatory wicket with the new cherry. {{BATSMAN}} c Rayudu b {{BOWLER}} 15(9) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni! Gone! Another short one, a bit of extra bounce and topspin, {{BATSMAN}} tries getting low and carving it away behind point, gets a little big on him, take the top-edge and into the gloves of the unerring MS Dhoni. Another one down, and that delays CSK's inevitable doom. Not a phrase you use very often, and perhaps one that has made several mortals on the sidelines swallow their words, but this one isn't looking great. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 36(22) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! It's all falling apart here for {{TEAM}}. First IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}} and he is thrilled. What a horror stroke from {{BATSMAN}} though? He knew that all the responsibility was now down to him and instead of playing through, he {{BATSMAN}}ci{{BATSMAN}}s to go for broke. Never the pitch for that kind of batting and he {{BATSMAN}}parts. A cutter on a good length and he tried to slog this away but only managed to skew this high towards extra cover. Raina charged forward to take it with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 8(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Williamson Run Out!! 1 run completed. What was {{BATSMAN}} Singh doing there? Could have attempted the second run, instead puts his arm up, Kane was halfway down the pitch and had no chance. Didn't take the first run briskly and that is why Yuvi said no. Every run is important in this form of the game. Games are won and lost even by a margin of 1 run. Looked like he never was keen for the second. Yorker on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} flicks into the vacant mid-wicket region, could have been two if he was a little quicker, the bowler had to run all the way to mid-wicket, he did well to fire an accurate throw to the keeper. Williamson run out ({{BOWLER}}/Uthappa) 40(25) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}}'s go-to delivery, the skidder. He may have anticipated a slog-sweep from {{BATSMAN}} and fired it straight on the stumps. Also the length was the key, neither full; nor short. Enough to defeat the batsman's instincts and strike him dead in front. {{BATSMAN}} was way too early on the shot. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 16(11) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! The wickets keep tumbling. Slower ball, in right-hander's swinging arc, {{BATSMAN}} got under it but he didn't give it a full whack. Relies on timing and chips it high into the night sky, Pollard is safe as a house at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 9(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Smith!! {{BOWLER}}'s done him with lack of pace. Really canny bowling. Cuts his fingers across, the ball holds up on {{BATSMAN}} as he tries to loft inside out and ends up slicing it in the air. Smith backpedals at least 10-15 yards from extra-cover, eyes on the ball all the time, and grabs it. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Smith b {{BOWLER}} 30(15) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out de Kock Run Out!! De Kock is gone by a mile. Dreadful running. There's a tremendous mix-up between the two batsmen and de Kock ends up around halfway down the pitch before the bails are taken off. The ball was patted towards backward point, {{BATSMAN}} started running, stuttered to look at his partner, and then ran through. But de Kock never really took off. de Kock run out (Vijay Shankar/Pant) 18(16) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by A Russell!! Catching practice for Russell at long-on and {{TEAM}} have lost their first wicket. This was tossed up nicely by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} came down the track, didn't get close to the ball as he went through with the lofted drive, went off the inside half of the bat and looped towards long-on. {{BATSMAN}} has played his part though, walks off to a decent round of applause. {{BATSMAN}} c A Russell b {{BOWLER}} 35(26) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! That's why you need these leggies. So all {{BATSMAN}} can manage is going past Gayle and Hussey. And no more. {{BOWLER}} is watching {{BATSMAN}}'s feet, he's reading his head, he knows it's his time to charge down. And fires it wide, well outside off, spinning big. Under the desperate attempt in the end to squeeze it out. Well MS has a deal with the speed of light, and an equally good equation with stumpings. {{BATSMAN}} st Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 47(36) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} looked all at sea against the short ball and it's a similar delivery that brings an end to his stay. Yet again, looks to unleash the pull but {{BOWLER}}'s got the pace and bounce, complete miscue and it's hung in the air for an eternity. For a brief period, there was confusion regarding who's gonna go for the catch, but {{BOWLER}} calls for it and takes it clean near the mid-wicket pocket. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 19(10) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! The nudge and nurdle around ploy comes to a halt. With required rate shooting up {{TEAM}} had to find momentum and in the process of finding some, {{BATSMAN}} goes after a floated up delivery and toe-ends the loft to long-on. KP moves a few yards to his right and takes it comfortably. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 12(17)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Maxwell!! Maxi you bewdy! What.A.Catch. Misjudged it for a fleeting moment at deep mid-wicket, but timed his leap to perfection to grab it over his head mid-air. Bonzer. All that after {{BATSMAN}} swatted a fullish delivery over mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Maxwell b {{BOWLER}} 77(48) [4s-9 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! What a moment in the game. Look at the celebrations in the {{TEAM}} camp. They reckon they've pocketed the game. {{BATSMAN}} is livid with himself. Swings his bat hard in disappointment. He knows that he's hit a long hop to the fielder. Short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} went back, lost balance while playing the pull shot, didn't middle it, Thakur jumped at deep mid-wicket and took the catch. The momentum was taking him back, took a couple of steps back, just managed to stay away from the rope and the third impire was convinced he didn't touch the boundary. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 24(22) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Lynn!! The off-pace delivery from a goodish length, {{BATSMAN}} wants to hoick it across the line, gets a fat outside edge that goes straight into the palms of Lynn at short third man. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Lynn b {{BOWLER}} 16(16) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} isn't happy as he walks off. Not sure about what - the decision or the selection of shot. It was tossed up delivery. {{BATSMAN}} gets down and goes for the reverse sweep. He is struck in front of middle. Ah! The replays show that there was glove involved there. So, that was the reason behind his disappointment. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 19(16) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! There's the virtual nail into Hyderabad's coffin. It's quick, it's bouncy and it's into {{BATSMAN}}'s shoulder. Poor {{BATSMAN}}, he didn't even get a sighter to deserve this brute. So he backs away, tries to get some bat, somehow in a weird pull of sorts. Ends up with the bat's shoulder, onto his shoulder for {{BOWLER}} to run under the balloon up. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ashwin!! Third fourth wicket haul in four games for {{BOWLER}}. He is increasing the gap for the leading wicket takers tally. Pitched the ball short and got it to grip off the surface, it kept decking away from {{BATSMAN}}'s reach, he slapped hard and got a thick toe-edge to short third man. {{BATSMAN}} c Ashwin b {{BOWLER}} 9(12)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Harbhajan!! Another one bites the dust. It was the googly from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} dragged that from outside off with his sweep shot. No timing behind it and he holes out at deep mid-wicket. Harbhajan gobbles it up above his head and has his arms aloft. {{BATSMAN}} c Harbhajan b {{BOWLER}} 4(12)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Things looking bleak for {{TEAM}}. 3 of their main batsmen are back in the hut now. No change of pace this time around, he spears it in at 136ks on a good length, {{BATSMAN}} checks his drive and chips it back to the bowler. Easily done. He was perhaps expecting the slower one. It came right off the cue end of the bat. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 13(10) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Guptill!! Had to happen. If you read the last delivery's description, you would know. Didn't use his feet to a fullish ball, so he shimmies out this time to compensate. The length's been nicely shortened by {{BOWLER}}, and also gets it to move away. The result: {{BATSMAN}} is down the track and slices an outside edge to gully -- yes, there was one, for {{BATSMAN}}. Comeback done and dusted. {{BATSMAN}} c Guptill b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Sensational bowling from {{BOWLER}} Kumar. Just brilliant. No way anyone's hitting this ball for six. De {{BATSMAN}} anticipates the yorker, walks across premeditatedly but he still can do nothing about it. Drags it off the insi{{BATSMAN}} edge and leaves his stumps in a mess. Leaves {{TEAM}}'s season in a mess. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 33(29) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gurkeerat Singh!! Just not in control. Another Hyderabad batsman falls in the quest to pump one over, somewhere, but once again, cannot time it one bit. So {{BATSMAN}} picks long-on in trying to go over with a lofted hoick, but ends up getting it high on the bat, dragging it away to Gurkeerat - who runs in, overruns perhaps, but does decently in the end to take it with tummy-support. {{BATSMAN}} c Gurkeerat Singh b {{BOWLER}} 4(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Narine!! That roar from {{BOWLER}} drowned the whole of Wankhede by itself. {{BATSMAN}} backs away to a low full toss on middle and spears it straight to point. He had timed the pants off it but couldn't have found the fielder any better. His stunning innings comes to an end. Oh what a game! {{BATSMAN}} c Narine b {{BOWLER}} 50(29) [4s-5 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! Oh dear! This is a huge moment in the match. Virat-the-run-machine-{{BATSMAN}} has departed in single digits. It was a shorter delivery, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and takes out the pull shot. He hits it straight to the Jadeja at deep mid-wicket and Jaddu is safe as a house. He takes it with utmost ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 6(12)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! What a ball. Cleans up {{BATSMAN}}. Has this man retired, {{BOWLER}}? Wowed I am. Pitches up and swings it in to find the gap between {{BATSMAN}}'s pad and bat. For all that peach from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} too is slightly responsible there. Went for the drive and pushed the defence a bit, leaving the space for the ball to sneak in. What a start for DD! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned up. Full and straight, with a late tail back in. {{BATSMAN}} swings to leg and can't connect. The ball clips the leg stump and {{BOWLER}} punches the air in delight. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 8(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Needless stuff from {{BATSMAN}}. Wanted to go for the glory hit and perished; was fullish and angling in, {{BATSMAN}} made room early and cleared his front leg to go over the leg-side, slices it off the toe-end and Hardik Pandya takes the simplest of catches at mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 5(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Excellent catch by {{BOWLER}}, considering his fielding standards mind you! He is one of the slowest, languid among the KKR fielders, but not on this occasion. Gets the ball to grip as he cuts as much pace as possible, {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull, but was way too early into the shot. A thick top-edge balloons around the mid-wicket area, {{BOWLER}} calls for it, runs around and grabs it. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 14(15) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! {{BATSMAN}}'s defiance ends. Fought hard but with this kind of a target, he needed support which he never got. Slower ball from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} went for a wild heave across the line. Only manages a thin feather through to de Kock who is having a good time behind the sticks. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 58(54) [4s-8 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hetmyer! That's a fabulous low catch! Umpire review - soft signal is out. He's played another one of his effortless flicks, uppishly this time, and Hetmyer has been quick in runnign in from the cow corner boundary to pick up a fantastic low catch! The catch, in all honestly, looks good. Very little evidence to overturn the soft signal - and OUT it is! {{BATSMAN}} c Hetmyer b {{BOWLER}} 24(17) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} tries to be too funky and instead loses his wicket. This was a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was setting himself up for the switch-hit, the length was a bit too full, he then decides to pull it away, gets the angles all wrong and misses the ball completely. It goes on and crashes into the top of off-stump. {{BATSMAN}} falls after a rather subdued innings. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 43(40) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shankar!! Anti-climax for the {{TEAM}} fans in the stadium. {{BATSMAN}} wanted the winning hit but departs. Ends up miscuing the pull and top edges it straight in the air. Dolly for Shankar at mid-off and he gobbles it up. It's been a scratchy season for {{BATSMAN}} and today is another innings of that kind. {{BATSMAN}} c Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 21(25) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Maxi is having fun out there. He is picking wickets like the way he knocks the switch-hits. 7 down now. {{BATSMAN}} crouches and looks to sweep Maxi through square leg, doesn't pick the line, neither the length. Strikes him low around off and that's smashing into middle. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. They say you don't run on a misfield and {{BATSMAN}}'s excellent knock has been ended by a brilliant piece of fielding by Umesh. Brilliant first with the full length dive to get a hand on the attempted square-drive to save the boundary, and then brilliant with recovery time and more importantly smash the stumps with a bullet throw and he had one stump to aim at from a side on angle. RCB are back in it! {{BATSMAN}} doesn't want to leave. He got greedy and hoped for a poor throw from the fielder but Umesh has a good throwing arm and was out by miles despite a dive. {{BATSMAN}} run out (U Yadav) 82(53) [4s-3 6s-8]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! {{BATSMAN}}'s fun-filled innings is over, but he has done his job. Banged in short and angling across the left-hander, the attempted slower bouncer from {{BOWLER}} - {{BATSMAN}} was looking to nail the pull wide of mid-wicket, gets an audible edge and MS does the rest. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 31(24) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! It was a troubled stay, and the end is just as troubling. {{BOWLER}} anticipates some more shuffling extravaganza here from {{BATSMAN}} and keeps it dead straight on middle. {{BATSMAN}} - this time - isn't as creative, sits down trying to slog it out over cow corner. But it's too quick. Too full. Under the bat and leaving a mess behind. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 20(24) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} given out leg-before. Now then, this is a big moment. He has gone for the review. Oh this looks close on the front-on replay. There's some turn, and {{BATSMAN}} is well forward. So there's a chance it might go down. No, it doesn't. Per ball-tracking, it's crashing leg stump - three reds. KKR needed this desperately to have any hope of getting back. And they're surely back in it now. Like the previous delivery, this one turned in as well with {{BATSMAN}} having little clue on the front foot. And this was much more adjacent. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 16(13) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! And {{BOWLER}} strikes. He was brought back to take out Russell but Rajasthan won't mind this. The set batsman departs and it is two new batsmen out in the middle. 140.5kph back of a length delivery angled in to the right hander, {{BATSMAN}} is a tad early into his flick and the leading edge balloons up, {{BOWLER}} calls for it and tumbles backwards as he completes the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 47(34) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Yuvraj!! {{BOWLER}} strikes back! That might have been the googly. Yeah, it seems so. {{BATSMAN}} went for another slog-sweep, but due to the variation, {{BOWLER}} managed to generate some extra-bounce which took more of a thick top-edge and lobbed up towards long-on. It still came really close to clearing the boundary though. Yuvraj keeps his cool and takes it smartly. {{BATSMAN}} c Yuvraj b {{BOWLER}} 30(22) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Lewis!! {{BOWLER}} and his funky bowling action has the better of {{BATSMAN}} - this was the leg-break, pitched outside leg and spun across the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} opened himself up for the big slog, got underneath the delivery, ended up slicing it high and towards wide long-on. Lewis kept his eys on the ball and takes a reverse-cupped catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Lewis b {{BOWLER}} 54(29) [4s-8 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Barinder!! Too cute, and that's never ideal. {{BOWLER}} gets his line wrong, slipping into the legs, but he's neatly disguised this slower back-hander. {{BATSMAN}}'s fooled as he loads up and commits to swipe it, knowing there's nobody at fine leg. Goes through early, gets a fat splice and short fine pockets the balloon. {{BATSMAN}} c Barinder b {{BOWLER}} 11(9) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Woakes!! This was coming. {{BATSMAN}} was struggling against the spinners and perishes trying to play the big shot. A tossed up delivery that pitched outside off and turned further away. {{BATSMAN}} got low and wanted to clear long-off. Doesn't get enough power behind it and a straightforward catch from Woakes at long-off. Lots of revs on that delivery. {{BATSMAN}} c Woakes b {{BOWLER}} 26(30) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Yuvraj!! Another low score for {{BATSMAN}}, he's been undone by the short ball once again. This was banged in short and just outside off, skidded through and hurried {{BATSMAN}} with pace, he was in a terrible position as he pulled, got a top-edge and all he managed to do was to find Yuvraj at mid-on. He accepts the chance gleefully and his reaction suggests how pumped up he's for this match. The customary check for the front-foot no-ball and {{BOWLER}} is fine on that count. Off he goes, {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Yuvraj b {{BOWLER}} 6(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Brilliant from {{BOWLER}} and he has his 21st wicket of IPL 2018. This is deception at its very best, the knuckle ball, pitched around off and seamed back into the left-hander, the length drew {{BATSMAN}} into an expansive drive, the gap between bat and pad was created, the ball snuck through and the off-stump went for a walk. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 9(7) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Off-cutter/yorker combo, not an easy one to get right, especially under duress, on middle, {{BATSMAN}} gets across to lap/ramp it away towards fine leg, misses it completely as the bails light up - and so do {{BOWLER}}'s eyes. Brilliant delivery under pressure. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 29(18) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! And {{BATSMAN}} is not a happy man trudging off. Don't think he gloved that flattish leggie. Looked to cut, was cramped for room and the ball jammed off his thigh pad into the gloves of the keeper. {{TEAM}} had lost their review earlier in the over and {{BATSMAN}} had to proceed with his walk towards the pavilion. {{TEAM}} are in disarray!! {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! This is what flight can do to you. {{BOWLER}} realizes it after being tonked around for a few. Slows it up, gives it a lot of air and invites {{BATSMAN}} to take it on. {{BATSMAN}} in his tentative reach outs looks to search for a feel of the turn. Only for the ball to drift away, bounce and go away past the outside edge for the keeper to do his bit. Yep, the back leg is way out. {{BATSMAN}} st Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 19(15) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Lynn!! The off-pace delivery from a goodish length, {{BATSMAN}} wants to hoick it across the line, gets a fat outside edge that goes straight into the palms of Lynn at short third man. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Lynn b {{BOWLER}} 16(16) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bumrah!! In 35 balls that he has bowled in IPL, Mayank {{BOWLER}} has dismissed Dhoni and {{BATSMAN}}. His CV will look good, for sure. So, {{BATSMAN}} plays a high-risk shot and perishes. Was a quick and flattish leg-break, {{BATSMAN}} goes down for the big slog sweep and top-edges straight to the man at long leg. Bumrah, the man in the deep, held his ground and took a calm catch. He was inches in front of the boundary rope. Went a couple of steps back, but looked back to find himself just in. {{BATSMAN}} c Bumrah b {{BOWLER}} 45(28) [4s-8]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned 'im up. It was right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} and he misses it altogether. {{BOWLER}} came round the wicket and pounded it on a length ball on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and heaves, but failed to connect with the ball. Crashed into leg-stump and {{BOWLER}} has his first wicket of the game. Big wicket at this stage. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 17(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! Has this sealed the match for DC? A superb running catch at {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket and yet another long hop has got them a wicket - this was short and AB rocked back on the pull, don't think he hit it all that well - Axar ran across from the {{BATSMAN}}ep, kept his eyes on the ball and then latched onto a fine overhead catch. He then had to make sure that he didn't step onto the ropes, which he did. The third umpire has a look and sends AB on his way. The equation has just got tougher for the men in red. {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 17(19) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Excellent review from Rahul. There was a run out and Samad was short, but he wanted the bigger fish. Challenged the LBW call and got it overturned. This was the slider which skids on, {{BATSMAN}} is caught in the crease, beaten for pace as he misses the nudge to the on-side, struck on the back pad in front of leg-stump and ball-tracking had it smashing into the sticks. So, {{BATSMAN}} falls three short of his hundred and young {{BOWLER}} has sent back both openers in a space of four balls. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 97(55) [4s-7 6s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} is on fire! His second wicket in that many overs. He is ensuring that KKR remains in the game. It was an off-spinner and {{BATSMAN}} was late onto it, trying to play across the line. Ball hits his pads and goes onto hit the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} will be gutted with this shot. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 7(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Thank you for coming. One ball is all {{BOWLER}} needed to send the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} back to the hut. Full, fast and straight - the mantra to get {{BATSMAN}} out. {{BOWLER}} angled across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}}'s feet went nowhere with the prod forward, the ball beats the outside edge and clatters into the off-stump. Early wicket for DD. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bairstow!! Massive wicket for Hyderabad. Superb review from them. There was a sound but umpire Illingworth was not convinced. It was short and way outside off, close to being called a wide but {{BATSMAN}} goes chasing after it and gets a toe-end, Bairstow does the rest behind the stumps. Replays also show a clear deviation in the path of the ball. {{BATSMAN}} c Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 6(5) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Aaron {{BATSMAN}} is given OUT lbw. Back-to-back golden ducks for him. He has reviewed. That looked plumb. Let's see. Fair delivery. No bat. Three reds and he is outta here. Here's the comeback from CSK. It was the quick googly from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} definitely didn't pick that. Presses forward to block and got rapped on the front leg in front of off. That's plumb. {{BOWLER}} is pumped. Runs with the arms aloft and slaps the CSK symbol with on his shirt. That's the passion with which he plays. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Game. Set. Match. That is a hugeeeeeeee wicket. The googly is misread. Looks to drive and misses it. The batsman tried to drive it but the ball bent in and the keeper did the rest as the back foot dragged out of the crease. Kohli is shocked. {{TEAM}} camp cannot believe it. More than that, {{BOWLER}} has hands on his mouth. He has shocked himself to a massive wicket. RR all over {{TEAM}} like a rash. One should compliment Klaasen for his sharp work, so quick with the gloves ala MSD. {{BATSMAN}} st Klaasen b {{BOWLER}} 53(35) [4s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Laughlin!! And {{BOWLER}} strikes. So, {{BATSMAN}}'s promotion doesn't work for {{TEAM}}. Fuller and slanted well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} in quest to clear the in-field on the off-side - slices it tamely off the outer half and skies it to mid-off. Safe as houses is Laughlin. One of {{TEAM}}'s supporters has his hands on his mouth. Just the start RR wanted. {{BATSMAN}} c Laughlin b {{BOWLER}} 5(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Samson Run Out!! Absolute waste of a wicket! Samson is livid as he walks back to the hut but he is also partly to blame. Was an in-angler on a good length and {{BATSMAN}} dabbed it towards the short mid-wicket region. Always was a risky run with {{BOWLER}} quickly moving across in his followthrough and there is a massive mix up with Samson way down the track. All three stumps to aim at and {{BOWLER}} doesn't miss. Not the start that the Royals were looking for. Samson run out ({{BOWLER}}) 0(0)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Cutting!! {{BATSMAN}} goes now. Off-pace slower delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands a foot outside off and then slugs this high up in the air, Cutting at deep mid actually misjudged it for an instant or two, but recovers to take it over his head and then tumbles over. Made a simple catch look difficult. {{BATSMAN}} c Cutting b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Negi!! Chinnaswamy breaks the sound barrier because {{BATSMAN}}'s dismissed. Hang on! They are checking for the no-ball but {{BOWLER}}'s foot is fine on this occasion. So, {{BATSMAN}} can continue his long walk back to the pavilion. Ushered it short at an awkward height for {{BATSMAN}} - tucking him for room, who tamely pulls it without any timing. Loops up to Negi at fine leg who has to cover some ground and also mind the ad cushions. Keeps his calm and snaffles it in front of his face, making sure he doesn't make any contact with the boundary. Outstanding catch and {{TEAM}} have lost their first wicket. Good comeback from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Negi b {{BOWLER}} 10(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Siraj!! Soft soft dismissal. And the sea of red is alive again. The momentum is broken and {{BATSMAN}} has himself to blame. That would have been a wide had he let go, instead reaches out for the full delivery and slices it to short third man. There was no need for him to play that. Could have picked up a wide and then made use of the extra delivery. Instead he loses his wicket. RCB needed that wicket as the partnership had started to flourish and was looking dangerous. {{BATSMAN}} c Siraj b {{BOWLER}} 52(31) [4s-4 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! What is happening? It's been lapped straight into the hands of short fine leg, but the umpire has gone upstairs for some reason. Oh wait, his decision was not out, and so Delhi reviewed it immediately. Bizarre. It looked like it came straight off the bat-face. {{BATSMAN}} walks across for the scoop, gets a thick inside edge onto thigh pad and it spoons up to Tewatia. So the decision will be overturned. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Tewatia b {{BOWLER}} 11(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Got him. And that's the big one. It's the slower ball again which does the trick. RPS have read this pitch like a book. {{BOWLER}} takes the pace off, bangs it on a back of a length and the ball dips underneath {{BATSMAN}} as he tries to heave it away. The middle stump is floored. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 14(18) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Morris!! Punjab's innings is coming apart. {{BOWLER}} is just too good for {{BATSMAN}}. Short of length and climbs up awkwardly onto the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} tries to turn it into the leg-side but only manages a leading edge to cover. Morris completes the dolly. The umpire checks for front foot error but {{BOWLER}} is fine. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Morris b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cheekiness gets the better of {{BATSMAN}}. He was trying to be too cute there, wanted to paddle it first then realised the line isn't there to play that shot. And went for a steer, in the end he got himself in a tangle and played a nothing shot. The googly went between his bat and pad and smashed the stumps. {{BOWLER}} is pumped! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 22(15) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! {{BOWLER}} strikes in his first over. {{BATSMAN}} scored a fifty in the reverse fixture but not today. And like the previous game, he falls to the leg-spinner. Backs away slightly to the leg-side, {{BOWLER}} pushed it through a bit and hence the slog sweep is not connected properly, hit it flat and straight to deep mid-wicket. Yadav did not have to move much to take that. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 14(13) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gayle!! {{BOWLER}} tears off the wrapping paper and presents RCB with a gift in his first over. Early strike from the home team. {{BOWLER}} was being under used in the last three matches. Makes amends immediately today with a prized scalp of {{BATSMAN}}. It was a fuller length delivery jagging in on leg-stump line, seemed to have stopped on {{BATSMAN}}. He flicks it meekly straight to mid-wicket. Gayle won't drop those. {{BATSMAN}} c Gayle b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! An excellent IPL comes to a sorry end for Jonny. And {{BOWLER}} as he has done throughout this IPL delivers for CSK with the new ball. It was a quicker one and was wide of off, it skids off the deck, takes the outside edge of {{BATSMAN}} who plays down the wrong line. And Dhoni makes no mistake, he never does! {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! A replica of his dismissal against Cummins in that game against KKR, where he looked so frenentic. Was more composed at the crease in the time he spent here, before this happened. Tries slogging {{BOWLER}} off a length and inside-edges it behind. De Kock flies to his left for an excellent grab. Royals in a hole. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 6(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rashid Khan!! That looked ugly, but {{BOWLER}} has his man. A pre-empted charge from {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} saw it coming and fired the slider - kept coming with the angle and cramped {{BATSMAN}} for room - he looked very awkward as he tried to force it away - off the toe-end of the bat and scooped in the air towards cover-point. Rashid under the ball and he doesn't drop those. {{BATSMAN}} c Rashid Khan b {{BOWLER}} 7(11) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} strikes. Gets the breakthrough for RCB which should give them some respite. Googly, spinning in and {{BATSMAN}} was trying to make room to cut. Was late to get his bat down and fails to read it. It thuds him on the pad - in-line with the stumps. Total misjudgement from the {{TEAM}} skipper, looked plumb straightaway and the umpire was spot on. Would've crashed into the middle stump. {{BATSMAN}} knew that he was in trouble and didn't bother it review it. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 22(20) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Inside-edge onto pad, but doesn't matter, the umpire has his finger up. No turn, just goes flat and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} is stuck inside the crease, tries to block off the front foot and ekes a big edge onto his pad. In real time though it appeared as if it had gone straight towards his pad. Wasn't to be. Big moment in the game? {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 38(19) [4s-3 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gayle!! Two in two for RCB. Chinnaswamy breaks the sound barrier. RCB are right back in this contest. Both openers back in the hut now. {{BOWLER}} looped it full outside off, it was the sucker ball and {{BATSMAN}} fell into the trap. Drove it on the rise straight to Gayle at short extra cover. The West Indian shows quick reflexes as he pouches an excellent catch. He was alert enough and his natural instincts took over there. {{BATSMAN}} c Gayle b {{BOWLER}} 3(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! That's a superb catch from Stokes - he hasn't just saved a six, but he has got {{BOWLER}} a wicket as well. Watches the ball all the way at the deep mid-wicket boundary, lunges behind, holds onto the overhead catch - realises that he was going over the ropes, chucks the ball back into play, crosses the ropes, comes back in and takes the catch. Coming to the ball, it was a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} backed away and swung hard - looked like he had got plenty behind it - only for Stokes to spoil his party. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by D Kulkarni!! Gone! He had no choice but to go after the bowling. There is plenty of batting still left for Mumbai. Slower short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} is backing away, all cramped up he tries to pull but only manages a top-edge to deep backward square, Kulkarni covers ground to his right and takes a well-judged catch. {{BATSMAN}} c D Kulkarni b {{BOWLER}} 34(33) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! Gone! {{BATSMAN}}'s cameo comes to an end. He is disappointed with himself. Slower short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} picked the bones out of that, struck right off the meat but he couldn't have picked the fielder out at deep mid-wicket better. Axar didn't have to move much to take that. {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 25(11) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shami!! {{BATSMAN}}'s ordeal comes to an end and the 20-year old is absolutely pumped. Couldn't have asked for a better debut. Rolled his fingers over this full delivery and asked {{BATSMAN}} to fetched it from outside off, the aimless slog loops up high in the air where Shami runs around to take a fine catch from short third. {{BATSMAN}} c Shami b {{BOWLER}} 26(21) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Boult!! Okay it's so simple. If you have a leggie in your team, make him bowl into the wicket/not too full and get it to turn outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} can't resist slogging across the line, unfortuanly the bat keeps turning in his hands and he slices them. This had a lot of height as he tried to fetch a pull shot, Boult moved a few paces forward and catches it. {{BATSMAN}} c Boult b {{BOWLER}} 11(18)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Henriques!! There you go! {{BOWLER}} strikes and breaks the partnership. {{BATSMAN}} was never comfortable against {{BOWLER}}. Doesn't pick the wrong 'un that doesn't spin much and goes for a wild slog sweep. The bat turns at the point of impact and he ends up slicing it high in the air. Henriques at extra cover calls fot it and catches it calmly. {{BATSMAN}} c Henriques b {{BOWLER}} 15(24)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tripathi!! Another one bites the dust. {{BATSMAN}} was completely undone by the lack of pace. {{BOWLER}} bowled it around 117kph on a short of a good length. {{BATSMAN}} is early into his stroke - to drive down the ground - and ends up chipping it high in the air off the outside part of the bat. Tripathi at mid-wicket settles under it and takes it with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Tripathi b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! {{BATSMAN}} is walking. Because he knows that he has not got the back foot back inside. A toppie, from the front of the hand, slides on quicker, beats the backing away {{BATSMAN}} on the cut, he overbalanced and when Klaasen whipped the bails off, the foot was on the line. Superb keeping from the South African as well. RR needed that wicket. {{BATSMAN}} st Klaasen b {{BOWLER}} 33(21) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Rayudu Run Out!! That's the end of Rayudu, wanted to get on strike as {{BATSMAN}} had missed the pull but the {{TEAM}} captain remained unmoved. Pant was quick to throw it towards {{BOWLER}} who fired a direct hit at the other end. Rayudu was way short and was never going to make it. Another valuable contribution from him nevertheless. Rayudu run out (Pant/{{BOWLER}}) 41(24) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jofra Archer!! Short again. And this time {{BATSMAN}} can't resist not poking. He goes back in the crease, goes up tall and tries half a cut, half a punch, and a full flirt after getting tied up with the zip in. Ends up with a thick outside splice, flying straight to the fine short third man placed perfectly out there. {{BATSMAN}} c Jofra Archer b {{BOWLER}} 13(13) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Finch!! The experience of {{BOWLER}} overcomes {{BATSMAN}}. He looks to slap the short ball, but fails to get the distance. Mistimed to long-on where Finch moves forward and reverse cups it. Right then, time for the miracle man - Tewatia to come in and take charge. Do we have another Tewatia special on the cards? {{BATSMAN}} c Finch b {{BOWLER}} 16(18) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karn Sharma!! {{BATSMAN}} combusts. {{BOWLER}} raises his hands aloft in joy. The bowler wins the battle and has the last laugh. Second wicket for {{BOWLER}}, nips out both openers. Looked like it was a certain trap, plotted by MSD and {{BOWLER}}. Much like the last ball, ushered it short and this was closer to the body. {{BATSMAN}} swung across, only height as it went a long way into the night sky. There was a fielder waiting at deep mid-wicket and he set himself under it to gobble it up. Safe hands from Karn Sharma. {{BATSMAN}} c Karn Sharma b {{BOWLER}} 26(16) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by A Russell!! {{BATSMAN}} goes back without troubling the scorers. {{BOWLER}} was amongst the wickets in the previous match. Gets rid of the dangerous opener in his very first over. It was the carrom-ball from {{BOWLER}} that went through with the anlge (over the wicket). {{BATSMAN}} went for the sweep and only managed a top edge. Russell comes in from {{BATSMAN}}ep backward square leg to snaffle it with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c A Russell b {{BOWLER}} 0(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Knocked him over! Down on one knee looking to thump {{BOWLER}} into MG Road. You miss I hit. Knocks the head of off peg. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 8(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Devdutt Padikkal!! What a way to start your spell! This is a massive strike first-ball by {{BOWLER}}. The dangerous {{BATSMAN}} is out of here. The umpires wanted to refer it upstairs for a bump ball but Jos was already walking. He knew it was a fair dismissal. Raw pace probably did him in here, very full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} tried to squeeze the drive but could only get a thick edge. Padikkal was placed at a wide slip, perhaps strategically and it's straight at him. Sharp low catch and RCB are absolutely pumped. Dream start for them. {{BATSMAN}} c Devdutt Padikkal b {{BOWLER}} 22(12) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Another knuckle ball, another wicket. Simple, right! Rajasthan are now in deep trouble. {{BOWLER}} changed the position of the ball in his hand at the last moment and {{BATSMAN}} had no clue about it. Waltzed down the track and wanted to pull it away. Early to swing the bat and the ball scoots under the blade. 32/3! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 16(11) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Pant takes a blinder to get rid of {{BATSMAN}}. The South African was looking play the scoop but makes a mess of it eventually. The ball catches the cue end, deflects on to his helmet grille and lobs to the left of the keeper. Pant charges to his left, puts in a dive and pulls off a stunning catch to bring an end to {{BATSMAN}}'s short stay at the crease. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 3(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! It is {{BOWLER}} makes the breakthrough. Soft dismissal it must be said. Down the track and chipped back to the bowler. Who throws the ball away in delight. Wakes the crowd up who were starting to get restless. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 18(15) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! KKR gets the much needed breakthrough. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't even wait for the finger to go up as he walks back. It was an off-spinner down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} gets a faint tickle to it and Karthik behind the stumps makes no mistake. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 24(15) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! First wicket for DJ {{BOWLER}} in IPL 2020. Pushes this fuller and in the outside off zone, {{BATSMAN}} looks to play a cheeky dab with an open bat face but the ball takes the bottom half and lands in the bucket hands of Watto at short third man. {{BOWLER}} went up straightaway and so did Watson, the umpires just wanted to be sure as they deemed the soft signal in favor of the bowler. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 81(51) [4s-8 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! What's happening here? They keep getting sucked into more miseries {{TEAM}}. Short ball, looks to pull and the top-edge was taken by the bowler himself. The keeper also went for it as no one called for it. But {{BOWLER}} kept his balance to take it. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out D Kulkarni Run Out!! 1 run completed. Almost a royal mess-up. But {{BOWLER}} recovers to run Kulkarni out. Driven to long-off. No way the second was on, not with Kulkarni running like that. {{BOWLER}} fumbled the throw but recovered to run Kulkarni out, who couldn't make it. But importantly {{BATSMAN}} will be on strike. D Kulkarni run out (Shubman Gill/{{BOWLER}}) 3(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hooda!! {{BOWLER}} foxes the young {{BATSMAN}} with a knuckle ball but he's showed his skills with the bat. It was full and {{BATSMAN}} was early into the shot, ends up chipping it Hooda at short mid-wicket, who takes the sitter. The spirited partnership has been broken and {{TEAM}} have lost their seventh wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 19(24) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled! He's been extremely iffy this over, and finally gives in! Angles in, some turn, {{BATSMAN}} tries cut it away, chops it onto his stumps trying to cut and looks disgusted with himself. Just at the stroke of the strategic time-out. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(13)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Low full toss, and flush on the back pad. Oh what a shame that is for {{BATSMAN}}. He's been absolutely phenomenal on the night, but falls just short of the finishing line. That's absolutely plumb, no question. On the flip side, how good has {{BOWLER}} been?! It's a five-for for him. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 95(50) [4s-9 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! Catching practice! And taken to his left at slip by the skipper. That was an away going short of length delivery and the batsman just opened his bat face to run it down. Cardinal sin it was with a slip in place. RCB are all over {{TEAM}} like a rash. The battle of the reds certainly has seen the visitors having the upper hand in the powerplay period. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rinku Singh!! {{BATSMAN}} is caught at long-on. A full toss and {{BATSMAN}} went too hard at it. The bat turns at the point of impact. Easy catch for Rinku Singh. The umpires go upstairs to check if it's a no-ball. Just below the waist height. {{BATSMAN}} c Rinku Singh b {{BOWLER}} 19(13) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! He's got him this time and off goes {{BOWLER}}. Oh what celebrations. It's the big wicket of AB {{BATSMAN}}, who goes for the cut shot again off the googly and perishes. Tried backing away to it, but the ball kept creeping in to {{BATSMAN}}ny the room. Eventually, crashes into the stumps off the un{{BATSMAN}}r-edge. This game has come alive. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by A Russell!! {{BATSMAN}} flicks this straight into the hands of square leg, what a soft dismissal! He immediately throws his head back, not able to believe what he's just done. Good length ball on leg-stump, and this is a loose shot from the captain. Just so lacklustre. This could get interesting. {{BATSMAN}} c A Russell b {{BOWLER}} 50(44) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Tripathi Run Out!! 1 run completed. That is farcical from Tripathi. What was he thinking? Called for the second run and then stops mid-way to spoil things for himself because {{BATSMAN}} had committed for the run. {{BATSMAN}} thuds this on-drive down the ground towards long-on. Finch has some distance to cover and Tripathi senses the second run. Withdraws late and digs his grave as Finch hits the target at the bowler's end. {{BATSMAN}} looked angry there. No fault of his though. Tripathi run out (Finch) 6(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! All the deliveries have been off-paced ones this over. Finally, it pays dividends for the Sri Lankan veteran. The cutter at 122kph and {{BATSMAN}} was early to close his bat-face. The ball popped up off the leading edge and {{BOWLER}} had to take a couple of steps backwards to gobble it up. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 20(17) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} reviews a leg-before call, inadvertently extending {{TEAM}}'s misery by a couple of minutes. Went for a reverse-sweep and missed it by quite a bit. The ball pitched around middle and leg, straightened and would have knocked the stumps over comfortably. {{TEAM}} go down to their eighth consecutive loss against MI. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 5(15)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Horrible mix-up and {{BATSMAN}} has to depart. A total communication breakdown between {{BATSMAN}} and Dhoni. A fuller length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} pushes it towards long-off and set off for the second. Dhoni showed signs of interest but on seeing the fielder rush onto the ball, he sent back {{BATSMAN}} and sold him down the river. The Bengal batsman had no chance of returning back once he took off. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Warner/{{BOWLER}}) 9(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by U Yadav!! And {{BATSMAN}} mistimes one. The trap had been set from {{BOWLER}}. The full wide delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was up for it, moved across to get close to the swinging range, the loft comes off the toe-end and skies up to long-off. Umesh jogs to his left and takes it comfortably. {{BATSMAN}} c U Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 8(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Corey Anderson!! A miscue. Plucked just inside the ropes. Gets a length delivery and unleashes a violent swing of the blade. Slices it high but not beyond the reach of Corey, who positions himself right at the edge of the ropes at long-on, and collects it without breaking into a sweat. Reverse cupped too. Talk of swagger. {{BATSMAN}} c Corey Anderson b {{BOWLER}} 12(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jofra Archer!! {{BOWLER}} has the last laugh! Was carted around in the last over but responds by breaking the partnership. Was the slower ball and quite full as well, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to carve this through the gap square through the off-side but ended up slicing it straight to Archer at backward point. Simple catch and it ends a decent knock from KLR. So, the gamble works for RR and Rahane. {{BATSMAN}} c Jofra Archer b {{BOWLER}} 52(47) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Morris!! Punjab's innings is coming apart. {{BOWLER}} is just too good for {{BATSMAN}}. Short of length and climbs up awkwardly onto the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} tries to turn it into the leg-side but only manages a leading edge to cover. Morris completes the dolly. The umpire checks for front foot error but {{BOWLER}} is fine. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Morris b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Avesh Khan!! Collision, a pop out and taken in the end. Pant and Avesh almost made a meal of it. {{BOWLER}} sees the funny side of it. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to heave it into the cow corner fence and the top-edge went straight up towards point, Pant ran across even as Avesh steadied himself under it, the ball hit Pant's gloves and then popped up, Avesh was the first to react and he claims the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Avesh Khan b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! A high full-toss has got rid of the big Jamaican. {{BATSMAN}} looked surprised, was looking to blast it over the top, can't get on top of the ball, it hit him high on the bat and lobbed over Samson at mid-off. He ran back, kept his eyes on the ball even as it landed beyond his shoulder, dives and clutches it with both hands. Chinnaswamy has been stunned into silence as the big man departs. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 6(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! {{BOWLER}} gets a wicket off his very first ball and out comes his little jig. An off-pace delivery at 101kph from a short of length. {{BATSMAN}} was a touch early into his pull shot and ended up dragging it straight to Jaddu at backward square leg. {{BATSMAN}} c Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 29(35) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Agarwal Run Out!! 1 run completed. Mayank Agarwal and his never-ending love affair with thirties. Lost the count of number of times he's been dismissed around 30s in the last two seasons. So {{BATSMAN}} flicks this to the left of deep mid-wicket and calls for two straightaway, Agarwal responds and had to put in a desperate dive to have a sniff at survival, wasn't to be. The throw from Rinku Singh was sharp and adjacent to the stumps, {{BOWLER}} doesn't gather it clean but manages to deflect the ball onto the stumps off his palm, totally unintentional but effective nevertheless. Agarwal run out (Rinku Singh/{{BOWLER}}) 36(26) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Rishi Dhawan!! What a huge wicket right after the break. The major threat of {{BATSMAN}} is gone, and KKR will really back themselves now to seal this. Not sure if this was the plan, or {{BOWLER}} just executed it incorrectly. He bowls it short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat at and the top-edge flies down for a comfortable catch to third man. Massive moment. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Rishi Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 17(17) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gowtham!! Gowtham is dramatic in his celebration. If you don't know why, scroll down and see how he was taken for runs in the last over. Takes the catch at extra cover and flings the ball at the stumps, and aggressively. A little OTT, the celebrations, but RR will take it. A short ball from {{BOWLER}} does the trick. {{BATSMAN}} is awkward as he goes back but is not really in a position to swat that across. Miscues that in the air and is caught. {{BATSMAN}} c Gowtham b {{BOWLER}} 21(7) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Chahar!! {{BOWLER}} could have conceded three boundaries in the over but luckily for him {{BATSMAN}} picks out the fielder at short fine leg. The Sri Lankan had fired this one down the leg side and the Australian flicks it straight to the uncapped Indian at short fine leg. {{BATSMAN}} can't believe his luck but such is cricket. He was dropped in the last game by Bairstow but not tonight. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Chahar b {{BOWLER}} 8(4) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nair!! He's cut that straight to backward point this time. That's a big blow. {{BATSMAN}} was starting to find some fluency but he now finds the fielder. Short and wide from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard but fails to keep it down and it's straight to Karun Nair. {{BATSMAN}} c Nair b {{BOWLER}} 22(20) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Roy!! Roy almost makes a mess of this at long leg, but he's recovered fantastically to take a superb low catch diving forward. They've referred it upstairs, but there's nothing wrong with it. Clean catch. His fingers are underneath it. The Englishman initially misjudged this top-edged sweep from {{BATSMAN}}, stalled in his position when he should have been moving forward. But makes up with a dive. {{BATSMAN}} c Roy b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rasikh Salam!! In the air and taken. {{BOWLER}} strikes back! It was banged in on a short of length, was on the face of {{BATSMAN}}. He attempts a cheeky upper cut and finds third man where the 17-year-old Salam takes it easily. {{BATSMAN}} c Rasikh Salam b {{BOWLER}} 4(2) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} strikes first ball, did the ball stay a bit low? {{BOWLER}} wouldn't complain though. He came from round the wicket and angled one back into the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was lazy in getting forward, his bat came down way too late - but by that time the ball had gone past him and pegged the off-stump back. {{BOWLER}} exults in delight, {{BATSMAN}} was looking in good touch, but it's only a cameo from him today. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 19(12) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Yuvraj!! Sweeps and sweeps his way to his doom. {{BOWLER}} has some sort of a revenge. Keeps flighting it up inviting the aggression. Gets it in the form of an uncontrolled sweep. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't really reach out, takes one hand off the handle as well as he top-edges it to a running in Yuvi from the square leg fence. The second time {{BOWLER}} has {{BATSMAN}}'s number this season. {{BATSMAN}} c Yuvraj b {{BOWLER}} 22(20) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! {{BOWLER}} ends his spell with a wicket, but the damage has already been done. Fires a wide one outside off and {{BATSMAN}} gets it off the cue end as he throws his hands at it. Good cameo by Patel. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 17(8) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Washington Sundar!! {{TEAM}} are falling away, Vettori looks motionless in the dug-out! {{BATSMAN}} falls to the short ball and his team have lost half their side now. Are they going to be the first team to be knocked out? The pressure of the dot balls consumed {{BATSMAN}} here. This was a well directed short ball, {{BATSMAN}} was beaten for pace as he looked to pull, gets a steepling top-edge, high and towards long leg. Sundar settles under it and holds on. {{BATSMAN}} c Washington Sundar b {{BOWLER}} 1(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Perfectly disguised slower one, and nobody's dropping them now. {{BOWLER}} has his moral victory, correcting a horrible start and messing around with {{BATSMAN}}'s head, who was waiting for it to get quicker. But it sticks in the pitch, with DK committing to his drive, and eventually trying to pull out. The result - a one-handed nothing chip, easy to extra cover close-in. {{BATSMAN}} c Bhuvneshwar b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! A long stare to the batsman, followed by a loud roar - that's {{BOWLER}}'s reaction. He has removed both the openers. Beautiful bowling. Tosses this well above the batsman's eyeline and that entices {{BATSMAN}} into a false stroke. He cleared his front leg to hack it over the leg-side and missed it completely. Was bowled full and {{BATSMAN}} was beaten in the flight. Middle stump takes the brunt. Replay shows that it was a wrong 'un. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 33(30) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Miller!! Clever from {{BOWLER}}! Second strike in the over and he's doing exactly what he was asked to do. Removes the {{BATSMAN}}s and now, Pollard is stranded with the tail left. This was a slower ball, comfortably slower than his stock pace and {{BATSMAN}} got early into the loft. Ends up chipping it towards extra cover where it's that man, Miller, again. Another sitter for the South African. {{BATSMAN}} c Miller b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jackson!! TWO IN TWO. {{BATSMAN}} walks. {{BOWLER}} has dismissed MS both times KKR played {{TEAM}} this season. The googly, lands it fuller and draws {{BATSMAN}} forward, he fiddles while striding forward a long way, thin edge through to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Jackson b {{BOWLER}} 5(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Loud shout for LBW and {{BATSMAN}} decides against a review. A little bit of a nibble and {{BATSMAN}} was caught right in front. On a good length and shaping back in, {{BATSMAN}} was shuffling across on the tuck, gets beaten on the inside edge and is struck around the knee-roll - adjacent to middle and leg, was going on to crash into the top of middle-stump and umpire Gaffaney has an easy call to make. {{BATSMAN}} has a chat with his partner and off he goes. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 5(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by A Russell!! Gone! One shot too many from the southpaw. KKR have got their early wicket. He cleared mid-off a couple of deliveries ago but not this time. He advances and once more gets very close to the ball, spoons the loft straight into the bucket hands of Russell at mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} c A Russell b {{BOWLER}} 16(8) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! {{BOWLER}} is too clever for {{BATSMAN}} here. He saw him coming down and bowled this cutter pretty wide. {{BATSMAN}} still throws his bat at it, only managing to lob it off the toe-end. No troubles for Surya at mid-off. You never say never, but it would take something sensational for {{TEAM}} to turn this around. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 12(13) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The off-stump goes flying. Bhuvi has had a fantastic bowling record over {{TEAM}} and it only gets better. It swings in the air, lands on the seam and shapes just enough to uproot {{BATSMAN}}'s off-pole. The slash-flash batsman had no clue about that one. By the time the ball dipped in, {{BATSMAN}} opened himself up completely and embarassed himself. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! {{TEAM}} continue to lose wickets in clusters. Two wickets in three balls now. Superb bowling from {{BOWLER}}. Unleashes the knuckle ball and dupes {{BATSMAN}}, who swung high in the air. Only height. Skies it into the dark sky towards long-off. Tiwary is safe as houses. {{BATSMAN}} c Manoj Tiwary b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! {{BOWLER}} gets the prized scalp of {{BATSMAN}}. He's such a smart operator and gives RR the first breakthrough. It was on a back of a length, decked away with some extra bounce. {{BATSMAN}} with a tentative and loose poke at that, it brushes the outside edge and Samson makes no mistake this time. Stunned silence in the crowd as {{TEAM}} have lost the in-form {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 30(22) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Perfect peach. And Rajasthan are well and truly doing a death over Mumbai. {{BOWLER}}'s the Jofra in the remake. Nothing slow here, full paced, 144kph, hitting the good length, seaming in sharply and staying low to go through the bat and pad on {{BATSMAN}}'s meek prod forward. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! You can't get more plumb LBW decisions than that. Umpire Nandan messed it up. The knuckle ball once again from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} is through his slog early and is struck on the back leg, yes back leg. The ball was crashing into middle stump as per ball-tracking and for some reason Nandan didn't give that out. {{BOWLER}} was quick to ask KW to take the review and the skipper obliged. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gowtham!! The fielder takes a good one behind square on the leg-side. It's a full ball and the batsman never got really under it. Got more altitude than distance -- as {{BATSMAN}} has today on more than one occasion -- and Gowtham charged in from the deep to take it. Good catch actually, flinging his body in front and plucking it above the ground. More importantly it is a dot ball. That might well have been another delivery where {{BOWLER}} ran his fingers on the ball. {{BATSMAN}} c Gowtham b {{BOWLER}} 20(14) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! {{BOWLER}} is on a hat-trick. {{BATSMAN}} coming ahead of debutant Prabhsimran doesn't pay off. What started with a boundary has ended with two wickets. Googly outside off, {{BATSMAN}} spotted it off the hand and heaved it with the spin, but could not generate power to clear long-on. Pandey takes a sitter. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has his first IPL wicket and that's a big one as well. {{BATSMAN}} was looking in good touch, decides to up the ante and instead has to walk back to the hut. Short of a length and on the stumps, wasn't short enough for the pull, {{BATSMAN}} went through with the shot, connected with thin air and the ball clattered into the top of middle. {{TEAM}} are beginning to boss this match now, can KXIP find an answer? {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 29(26) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! No escape for {{BATSMAN}} this time. {{BOWLER}} picks up his second wicket. Short of a length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slashes his willow and gets an outside edge which is gobbled up by Samson. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 4(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nabi!! {{BATSMAN}} has been worked out. This is a crucial wicket for SRH as we all know how dangerous {{BATSMAN}} can be towards the back-end of the innings. It was banged in short, the batsman wasn't expecting it. Gets cramped for pace and room, went for the pull and poor connection sees him slicing it off the top half of the bat to long-off. Nabi takes the sitter. {{BATSMAN}} c Nabi b {{BOWLER}} 18(10) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mandeep!! Straight down the throat of Mandeep at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} is disappointed, reckons he should've got it away over the ropes. Fullish, nipping back in a bit and {{BATSMAN}} wallops it off his pads. Didn't impart enough power to clear the fielder and Mandeep doesn't drop those. {{BATSMAN}} c Mandeep b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Maxi roars. {{TEAM}} fans are absolutely shattered. One guy has ran out of expressions, he just tweaks his hair while giving THAT WHAT.THE.____ expression! Oh boy! Things going bad to worse for {{TEAM}}. No real turn, just stump-to-stump channel and fired it flat, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back to pull, a big swish across the line. Misses by a long way and the middle pole takes the pasting. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 46(40) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Looks to go for the slog sweep, the googly undoes him and he manages a big fat top-edge. The high ball comes down for the bowler to pouch that. The trademark celebration from {{BOWLER}} follows. That was a disastrous strike for {{TEAM}} as they had lost Amla a couple of balls earlier. The promotion didn't really yield the desired results. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 24(22) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rajpoot!! {{TEAM}} are losing some momentum towards the end. {{BOWLER}} has another wicket to his name, this was a yorker length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} jammed his bat down hard, gets a thick outside edge and the ball loops to Rajpoot at short third man. Some other day, it might have gone either to his left or right, but not today. {{BATSMAN}} c Rajpoot b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! And a tough learning curve for {{BATSMAN}} is over. Slaps a shortish ball straight down the throat of the man at deep mid. That was slower and {{BATSMAN}} despite timing it found the fielder. {{TEAM}} have lost the plot here. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 15(20)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hooda!! Wicket right after the break. How many times have we seen that! And it is a big one. {{BATSMAN}}, who scored a hundred against this team last yer at the same venue, holes out in the deep. Flighted outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends forward and does not go through with the loft, just a check-lift and it still ends up near the long-off rope, Hooda used his height well and took it over his head right on the edge of the fence. {{BATSMAN}} c Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 5(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Hit Wkt!! That is why you should not use the depth this much. Goes back to tuck and after making the connection steps on the stumps. Dhoni realizes and appeals but {{BATSMAN}} is already walking before the customary check sent upstairs confirms the wicket. What a soft dismissal indeed. {{BATSMAN}} hit wkt b {{BOWLER}} 10(9) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! The Hit Man does it for the MI si{{BATSMAN}}. He flies to his left and flings his left hand to pick that out of thin air. That was chipped away uppishly sans any control from ABD and the ball was picked up inches from the ground as Rohit {{BATSMAN}}ci{{BATSMAN}}d to showcase his wings at extra cover. Third time {{BOWLER}} has accounted for ABD in the IPL. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 19(21) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} has struck gold in his first over! This was pushed through flatter and quicker, the wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} was down on his knees as he went for the sweep and missed, struck pretty adjacent to the stumps and it's an easy call for the umpire. The impact was in front of middle, would have been going on and hitting the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 5(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! This is anticlimactically entertaining. Didn't read the googly at all. Was bowled flat and straight on off, the ball cut in and pinned {{BATSMAN}} in front. He had no clue. Was making room and the ball skid on to pin the back pad. What a good selection he's turning out to be. Big game, so there was every temptation to go for Harbhajan but Rohit persisted with him and see what he's done. Third wicket for just 8 runs. And he has two overs left for goodness sake. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! Catching practice for Raina at extra cover. {{BOWLER}} breaks into a jig and {{TEAM}} on top now. Two wickets in three balls and DC are in trouble. It was fuller and just outside off, seemed to have stopped on the wicket a tad and {{BATSMAN}} checks his shot early and airly to Raina, who makes no mistake. Could this be the game-changing over? {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 2(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! The moment he tosses one up, he gets a wicket. I was surprised by that first delivery when he chose to bowl flat. Enough in the pitch for a spinner to enjoy his outing. A gentle fist pump from the local lad. This was the googly, {{BATSMAN}} went for the sweep, went with hard hands, got a top edge and Iyer came forward from deep backward square leg and took a good catch. Big wicket for DD. {{BATSMAN}} was well set and he needed to carry on. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 28(17) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Cummins!! A fine knock comes to an end. Cummins might not be bowling well but he is catching everything that is coming his way. It was a juicy full toss but a tired {{BATSMAN}} did not have enough in the tank to capitalize, he miscues the big heave and holes out to long-on. {{BOWLER}} picks up his second and he has done a decent job this over. Can he finish it well? {{BATSMAN}} c Cummins b {{BOWLER}} 80(54) [4s-3 6s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! And the game's killed. Go on, shake your sanitized hands and move on with life. {{BOWLER}} digs in a short-quick one, hurrying {{BATSMAN}} into his pull for a top-edge that balloons and dips in front of mid-on. Fhawan's there, diving into it, and thigh-slapping. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 6(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Deepak Hooda!! Duck for {{BATSMAN}}! This is why {{BOWLER}} is in the team. There are many left handed batsmen in Mumbai's batting line-up, gets one of them. Tosses it up nicely and invites the batsman to come down the track. {{BATSMAN}} does so, goes for it and ends up spooning it up to long-off where the sub calls for it and hangs on to it. These wickets are making the match interesting. So far, so good. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Deepak Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Dropped, but {{BATSMAN}} is run-out. An absolute pandemonium out there. Who would have thought that a team that played so well and topped the league stage would find themselves at 79 for 7 in the 15th over of the final. And that too after opting to bat first. Rohit {{BATSMAN}} can't watch from the sidelines. Coming to the delivery, this one swung away from the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} got a thick outside edge which went low to Christian's left at first slip. He couldn't hold on, meanwhile {{BATSMAN}} thought of stealing a run, his partner wasn't sure and in the end he was stranded in the middle of the pitch. Great presence of mind from the bowler to run towards the striker's end and effect the run-out. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Christian/{{BOWLER}}) 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! BMac misses, {{BOWLER}} hits. That was an ordinary slog and the bowler despite bowling length gets the big fish. Tried going across the line with the thwack and missed it completely. {{BOWLER}} punches the air in delight. MI strike early. Second failure in succession for BMac. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! Looks to swing hard and is gone. He was never in today. The bowler cut his fingers over the ball and that tricked the batsman, who was early into his stroke. A thick edge and the keeper did the rest. {{BATSMAN}} was again trying to drag it away into the on-side and lost shape completely trying to strike it hard. DD looking down the barrell. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 17(12) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Dhoni takes it on the second attempt! Sharp catch as this was a healthy edge and the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} has to depart. Was the quicker one and he wanted to essay the back foot cut. Got a thick nick that bobbled up off Dhoni's gloves for a moment and he held on. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 18(14) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Malinga!! Talk of dreamy bowling figures. 3 wickets, 2 runs. This is a T20 mind you. And a qualifier too. {{BOWLER}} helps himself to a few free ones. Bangs it in short, {{BATSMAN}} wants to pull it into the river. The sluggish pitch makes him wait and then spits the ball up too. Just the top edge but Malinga swirls all under it at long leg, almost messes it up and then dives to bring about a massive smile on his face. {{BATSMAN}} c Malinga b {{BOWLER}} 31(25) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! More energy expended by Imran {{BOWLER}} in celebration. Tiring just to watch. He floats this googly wide outside off, makes {{BATSMAN}} reach for it, and then turns it away further. Flew off the edge to Watson at slip who took a sharp catch. Delhi slide further. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 9(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Soft dismissal. Slower delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} plays early and slices it straight to short third man. {{BOWLER}} gets his name into the wickets column to please himself and the ones who have taken him in their fantasy teams. By the way, that was {{BOWLER}}'s 50th IPL wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 11(11) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Anmolpreet Singh!! {{BOWLER}} strikes first ball! He lets out a roar too and why not! This is a massive strike for the Mumbai Indians as {{TEAM}}'s last match hero {{BATSMAN}} goes. Was a similar shot to the one he survived in the previous over, went hard on the cut this time and it was a fizzing leg break that turned quite a bit. The bounce also undid Faf who sliced it straight to backward point. Super Kings dented early! {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Anmolpreet Singh b {{BOWLER}} 6(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Santner!! {{BOWLER}} returns, {{BOWLER}} strikes. {{BATSMAN}} was sent to counter the left-arm spinner and the leg-spinner but he perishes while doing so. Flighted around off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} kneels down and slog sweeps, he didn't get it anywhere close to the middle and ends up offering a sitter to Santner at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Santner b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}}'s struggle comes to an end. Walks back after consuming 16 deliveries for his 7. Scored a boundary that too off an inside edge. Hard luck. Was the wrong 'un around middle and the batsman got beaten due to the googly. Struck in front of middle and going on to hit the leg-stump. Lamichanne makes an impact in his first game of the season. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 7(16) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! {{BOWLER}} strikes. Each of Kohli's moves have paid off today. Brought in Siraj got a wicket, de Grandhomme did the same and {{BOWLER}} follows. Bit of air on this one and {{BATSMAN}} is down on one knee to play the slog sweep, does not get the required elevation to clear deep mid-wicket and finds Kohli to perfection. The skipper had moved himself there after the third ball. {{TEAM}} slip further and their chances of getting a good total are gone with {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 26(23) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! He is yet to give a run. But has a couple in the wickets column against his name. {{BATSMAN}} looks to stay true to his pinch hitting role with a violent swish of the bat. But just doesn't bother moving his feet while looking to deal with this tight length delivery. Swings, gets the inside edge and watches his bails light up. A big time loss of shape. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(10) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! That's a top-catch from Shardul - he called for the ball, sprinted a long way towards square leg, got to the ball and then juggled it, but doesn't panic - holds onto the second attempt and {{TEAM}} have lost their fourth wicket. He's on a roll, the Mumbai speedster. This was a well directed bouncer, short and climbing onto the left-hander, cramped for room, {{BATSMAN}} still went for the pull, gets a big top-edge, high and towards square leg. MS went for the catch, but the bowler called it out and then held on. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 7(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kuldeep Yadav!! Gone now. As soon as he hit that, {{BATSMAN}} knew he had made a mistake. Good short of length delivery on the hips, rising, {{BATSMAN}} cannot keep the short-arm jab pull down and picks out deep square to perfection. Kuldeep didn't move a muscle there. {{BATSMAN}} c Kuldeep Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 7(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Johnson!! The end of the rebuilding. Courtesy a stunner in the deep. And some greedy batting to go with it. {{BOWLER}} after a few carters doesn't really mind floating it up and he does it again. Entices {{BATSMAN}} into some feet dancing. Is obliged with the same. Just that in the process he gets too close to the pitch of the delivery and the tonk-slog attempted grabs only the toe-end of the blade to fly towards long-on. A jump, an arm raise and a reverse cup - as clean as a whistle executed by the man who claims to be 35. The best {{BOWLER}} figures in the IPL. A time-out with that. {{BATSMAN}} c Johnson b {{BOWLER}} 28(31) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mandeep!! Something always coming. A big shot. A big heave. A big miscue. Sees the shortened length for a change does {{BATSMAN}} and looks to post it into the night sky. Just that gravity gets hold of the skier that initially was a mistimed pull with a swivel and finds the lone man at the square leg fence to pouch it. {{BATSMAN}} c Mandeep b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Big loud nick. {{BOWLER}} has {{BATSMAN}} for the third time in as many IPL innings -- this time with {{BATSMAN}} throwing it away after losing patience, losing shape and losing his timing. He tries a cross-batted heave but the length's a little too full to be doing this, and ends up getting a tickle on the under-edge through to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 11(12) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! The ploy to bring in NCN has worked. He has been superb at the death, but GG needed a wicket here. Fullish length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get underneath it and goes hard on his lofted extra drive. Finds extra cover to perfection. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 24(26) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! The slower delivery does it again. Dada and Ponting at the dug out are roaring out loud as well. Big moment in the game. {{BATSMAN}} looked to slap it, toe-ended it and the man at midoff back-pedalled a bit to take it. Huge, huge wicket for DC in the circumstances. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 51(47) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Two in a row. And is both the batsmen who'd done all the hard work in setting themselves up for the final slog. {{BOWLER}} comes back with an off-cutter and keeps the aim up and right on the money. Stays much lower as well. Through the defences and under the early pull to light up the zing bails once again. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 27(24) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bairstow!! SHR review an edge: A googly, spinning sharply across {{BATSMAN}}'s heave. And there's a little tickle off the toe-end. Bairstow's heard it, but he whips the bails off before appealing, confusing the umpire. So again, the excuse of blaming it on the loud noisy crowds for umpires missing nicks stands exposed. {{BATSMAN}} c Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 34(31) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} strikes! And he is off! His customary celebratory run. He bamboozles {{BATSMAN}} with a googly. It tweaked in at pace as well. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't pick the wrong 'un and is also late to bring his bat down. The ball cannons onto the stumps. Through the gap between the bat and the pad. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 14(9) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hooda!! They've played with his ego, and {{BATSMAN}}'s fallen right into it. A leg-breaking skidder in the slot inviting {{BATSMAN}} to go over long-on. He does just that, gets it flat, but with the lofted drive coming off the inside half. And Hooda steals the show, spotting it quickly from a wide long-on and sliding under it in front of the sightscreen. The show's over boys. {{BATSMAN}} c Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 16(14) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Guptill!! A bird, a plane. Oh no. That's Martin Guptill. What in every world could only have been a smoke down the ground with {{BATSMAN}} in his mood dancing and tonking sucked out by the only man who could have taken this. And he does it with a jump, a one-handed raise and taking it as cleanly as it could. Forget the boundary run-ins and throw outs. This is sheer timing. {{BATSMAN}} c Guptill b {{BOWLER}} 59(32) [4s-5 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nair!! And what does he do first ball? Advances and connects well, but finds the fielder at deep backward square leg. It was a short slower ball, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to flick that in the gap wide of deep mid-wicket, but hit it too square and too well. {{BATSMAN}} c Nair b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard! That is an incredible catch! I mean, he did make things difficult for himself to be honest. Not sure he knew where the boundary was. {{BATSMAN}} just got under a really full one and tried to launch this over long-on, but hand to take on the tallest fielder in the opposition - Pollard ran towards the left and leapt up, got a hand, but the ball bounced out in the first attempt - and yet, he was quick enough to grab it in the second attempt! {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 70(44) [4s-4 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Trouble. More trouble for {{TEAM}}. Another pinpoint yorker from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} couldn't lay bat on ball and he tried to steal a bye after it snuck past the leg stump, Pooran throws and misses, {{BOWLER}} doesn't miss it this time though. Collects the ball mid-pitch and sees both batsmen stranded in the middle. Walks forward and disoldges the bails at the striker's end with supreme ease. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Pooran/{{BOWLER}}) 2(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karn Sharma!! You can only see the Aussies and the Kiwis hugging in the IPL. Big wicket and Rohit pumps his fist in joy. A fat top edge on the pull as {{BATSMAN}} was hurried by the back of a length delivery, went miles up in the air, looked a tough catch, Karn at short fine though judged it beautifully and took it the conventional way. He didn't go for the reverse cup. {{BOWLER}} did {{BATSMAN}} for pace. {{BATSMAN}} c Karn Sharma b {{BOWLER}} 21(16) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Off the pads and into leg-stump. {{BOWLER}} followed {{BATSMAN}} with a full ball as he backed away a touch. The delivery is too quick for {{BATSMAN}}. He misses his swipe through mid-wicket and the ball deflects off the pad to knock over the timber. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 13(14) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} doesn't spot the googly and pinned in front of middle. Chris Gaffaney shakes his head in denial. That looked plumb. Mumbai Indians review. Fair delivery. Nothing on the UltraEdge. Three reds and {{BATSMAN}} is gone for a single digit score. {{BOWLER}} is having a ball here at the Wankhede. Second wicket for him with the wrong 'un. Should have been three. The quickish googly and {{BATSMAN}} wasn't commited - either on the front foot or on the back foot. Didn't pick it at all and got beaten on the inside edge by a fair margin. The impact was on the back leg adjacent to off and middle. Can't get more plumb than that. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 5(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Chipped back to {{BOWLER}}. A yorker length delivery that was squeezed back off the toe-end, and not many CSK players appeared too excited about it. They thought it was a bump ball. But {{BOWLER}} went up straightaway. And he's right. Third umpire verifies that it landed on the pitch, then came off the bat. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Narine!! {{BATSMAN}}' misery is over, never got going on this spicy pitch. This was pitched up and angled across the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to go over the top, doesn't get anywhere near the middle of the bat and it's a simple grab for his West Indies teammate - Narine holds onto the dolly at mid-off and {{TEAM}} have lost an early wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Narine b {{BOWLER}} 0(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! This has been a nightmare. Finally, it ends for {{BATSMAN}}. That was a slow googly, the batsman was too early into the pull and misses it. The ball takes its time to tickle the leg-stick. To make matters worse for {{TEAM}}, maiden over from Mishy! The three dots also would not have helped the equation for {{TEAM}}. DD look set to break their jinx. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Warner!! Bhuvi has done him with the leg-cutter. This is a huge breakthrough for the home side. Really smart bowling. He knows {{BATSMAN}}'s after him so the line is a bit wide of off, the leg-cutter means that there is extra bounce too. Hence, instead of sitting up for {{BATSMAN}}'s heave over mid-on, the ball slices up in the air towards long-off where Warner has no problems in gobbling it up. The skipper's pumped. {{BATSMAN}} c Warner b {{BOWLER}} 10(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Boom! {{BOWLER}} strikes. Its the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} who has to walk back to the hut. The crowd find their voices back. {{BATSMAN}} makes a blunder by walking across his sticks, {{BOWLER}} kept it simple, bowled full and raps him low on the pad. Was beaten for pace and was struck right in front of middle. {{BATSMAN}} is disappointed. Big wicket for the home team. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 32(24) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rutherford!! Oh dear! That's a killer blow for {{TEAM}}, {{BATSMAN}} has pulled a half-tracker into the hands of Rutherford at deep mid-wicket. He looks gutted and all of a sudden, {{TEAM}} have lost two quick wickets. It was dropped short and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} rocked back on the pull, but he couldn't have placed the shot any more perfectly for the hosts - straight into the big hands of the West Indian. {{BATSMAN}} c Rutherford b {{BOWLER}} 23(17) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! That's a soft dismissal, the pressure of getting quick runs does {{BATSMAN}} in. He came down the track to a floater outside off, perhaps would have served him better had he gone down the ground, instead, he was looking to drag it wide of long-on, hits it a lot straighter and down the throat of Manish, who ran in from long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 17(15) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! Soft dimissal for {{BATSMAN}}. A daft little shot - to be precise. This was a back of a length delivery outside off, the width was there to cut, instead, he attempted something of a forehand jab, doesn't keep it down and hits it straight into the hands of Rohit at mid-off. Not the start {{BATSMAN}} wanted in his new franchise. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 6(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! The pain, the suffering comes to an end. The off-cutter from {{BOWLER}} and it dips on {{BATSMAN}}, who looks to go across the line, the toe-end goes straight up and Rohit settles under it near extra cover. He walks back to the dressing room and would love to be a fly in there. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 40(47) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Charges down first ball and is nowhere near it. {{BATSMAN}}, finding a place in the team today, goes for a duck. Third wicket for {{BOWLER}}, who kept this wide outside off and once again ensured the length's short enough. Easy stumping. {{BATSMAN}} st Samson b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} has got past the dangerous opening partnership. Karun was looking solid, but gets too ambitious and pays the ultimate penalty. This was tossed up on the off-stump line, Karun went down on his knees as he looked to play the slog sweep, missed it completely and was struck on the back thigh-pad. Was the impact outside off? Need to have a look at the replays, but it was certainly hitting the stumps, the umpire doesn't think a lot, up goes the dreaded finger. Replays prove he was just about right, both impact and hitting the stumps remained with the umpire's call. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 15(17) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The stumps are in a mess! This is excellent stuff from {{BOWLER}} and this is why he is sought after in the T20 format. Loves bowling at the back end of the innings. This is a big strike for KXIP as the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} has to depart. He did get going tonight from the word go but his cameo has been nipped in the bud. The cutter from {{BOWLER}} and he did smartly to attack the stumps, a wild slog attempted and once {{BATSMAN}} missed it, he knew the result. Woodwork destroyed! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 23(13) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Head!! {{BOWLER}} continues to have a good match. 30 odd runs and now two wickets. With the left-arm spinner on, mid-wicket is an easy area to target for a left-hander as he can hit with the spin, {{BATSMAN}} went for the big slog-sweep, seemed to have got it on the outside half of the bat. Head was close to the rope at deep mid-wicket. Took the catch, the momentum was taking him beyond the boundary. Released the ball before crossing over and recovered quickly to grab it again. {{BATSMAN}} c Head b {{BOWLER}} 27(28) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! And the mentalist fails to pull off the unfathomable tonight! Low full toss, {{BATSMAN}} finally nails the timing on this with a bottom-hand whip, flat and fittingly straight the his opposite number at long-on. A sigh of relief for DD. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 17(23) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! {{BOWLER}} has his first IPL wicket since 2015. But no, forget that. That's not the best part. Hardik Pandya's a credit stealer .. with {{BATSMAN}} slicing yet another off-paced delivery outside off. But that means he's got to manufacture all the pace on this himself, which he can't with these 70-meter-boundaries. Anyway, here's what Pandya does: he's at sweeper, and the ball's quickly flying wide of him to his left. So he runs, intercepts while running, side-on, and makes sure he doesn't overbalance. Sorry, words will never do justice. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 24(18) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} is gone for nought. {{BOWLER}} is running riot. The extra delivery brings MI a wicket. Fourth wicket down and things look bleak for DD. They need something special to get out of this. Good length delivery with a bit of inward movement, {{BATSMAN}} is caught in the crease, beaten on the inside edge and the ball hits the back pad right in front of middle. Umpire Ravi had his finger up in a flash. {{BOWLER}}'s current figures: 2-0-7-3. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Oh no! Good comeback by {{BOWLER}}. He persisted with the short ball and got it higher than the previous ball. {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull and only managed a top-edge, goes straight up and both {{BOWLER}} and Dhoni converge, in the end it is the bowler who gets there first. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 6(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! {{BOWLER}} has {{BATSMAN}}. That's a really sharp short ball. {{BATSMAN}} was on the move down the pitch, {{BOWLER}} bangs it in and gets it around head high. {{BATSMAN}} still doesn't back down. He has a big swish at it and probably caught it right off the bottom of the bat. It slices up in the air for a simple catch to Rahane at sweeper cover. Another wicket, especially of AB, and things will get really interesting. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 28(19) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! This is poor cricket from KXIP, they are losing wickets in clusters. Another unnecessary shot from {{BATSMAN}} and he's stranded way outside the crease, gave away his intentions way too early, stepped down the track, allows {{BOWLER}} to shorten his length. He still didn't accept defeat, swung recklessly across the line and missed, an easy stumping for de Kock. {{BATSMAN}} st de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 11(9) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bairstow!! {{BATSMAN}} has done all sorts of Bollywood moves whilst at the crease. It's very hard to hit {{BOWLER}} with such constant shuffly movements. So, Piyush {{BATSMAN}} tries to reverse swat {{BOWLER}} over short third but all he could manage was a fine tickle on the glove. Sharp reflexes from YJB. {{BATSMAN}} c Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 4(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! Catch numer three for Faf and wicket number three for {{BOWLER}}. What a turnaround this has been from him. 29 in the first two overs, now has three. Sticks this back of a length delivery into the pitch, a brilliant option on slow surfaces, {{BATSMAN}} looks to pull, high in the air and Faf has it easy. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 11(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned up! But {{TEAM}} will reckon he has done his job. {{BOWLER}} is pumped. He tried the short ball - didn't work. Tried the yorker - didn't work. What was left? The slower ball - worked. The off-cutter and it holds up on the surface, {{BATSMAN}} is through his heave early and the ball arrives later to uproot the leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 25(8) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} has been given out lbw. He reviews after a brief contemplation with his skipper. Legal delivery. Nothing on the UltraEdge which means no bat involved. Waiting for ball-tracking... {{BATSMAN}} though isn't waiting for anyone. He keeps walking back to the pavilion and rightly so. Umpire's call on hitting clubbed with a couple of reds. {{TEAM}} won't lose the review, but they lose {{BATSMAN}}. Cleverly bowled by {{BOWLER}} there. Went wide of the crease and bowled the slider on a goodish length, beat {{BATSMAN}} on the sweep and pinged him in line with middle stump. Looked rather close to the naked eye, but technology always finds ways to surprise us. Just brushing the top of leg peg according to HawkEye. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 34(25) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Deepak Hooda!! Sunrisers have pulled this off miraculously. Fifth loss for {{TEAM}}. Second lowest ever total defended in IPL history. What.A.Thriller. Final wicket razzmatazz: Short ball angled in, {{BATSMAN}} top-edged the pull before mid-wicket swallowed the swirling ball. Easy as you like. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Deepak Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out de Kock Run Out!! Needless stuff from Mumbai. Will this prove to be a game-changing moment? SKY cut this flat delivery straight to Rabada at backward point and he instantly ambled forward before aborting his sprint midway down the pitch, de Kock though was committed on the run and he kept racing to the other end seamlessly. Rabada spotted the hara-kiri and fired a smart throw to Pant who relayed it back to the bowler to catch de Kock a country mile short of his crease. de Kock run out (Rabada/Pant/{{BOWLER}}) 35(27) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by {{BOWLER}}!! The {{BOWLER}} duo does it. {{BATSMAN}} stands in disbelief, he is cursing himself as he walks back to the pavilion. A well flighted delivery around middle and leg and thus, {{BATSMAN}} thought he could flick it away into the leg-side, wasn't to be. Might have played the shot a touch too early and the leading edge pops up straight to the KXIP skipper at extra cover. {{BATSMAN}} c {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 43(24) [4s-7 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rashid Khan!! The luck runs out. But it's done the damage. On the shorter side, with the pace taken off the ball as well. {{BATSMAN}} looks to go ahead with his front-footed pulls but wears it high on the bat with the face swaying upwards as well. For a change, the airy ride finds its destination in the hands of Rashid at mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Rashid Khan b {{BOWLER}} 68(39) [4s-5 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Narine!! And {{BATSMAN}} combusts. Krishna has been pretty impressive today. The slower short ball, angling at {{BATSMAN}}, who in a bid to pull - gets it high on the bat. Skes it to square leg and Narine ain't dropping those. {{BATSMAN}} c Narine b {{BOWLER}} 10(7) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mandeep!! That's the end of {{BATSMAN}}, but he has played another fine hand for his team. Short and just outside off, he got into a good position on the pull, but doesn't get hold of the shot. Went high and straight into the hands of mandeep - who was standing in front of the ropes at mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} has his bat on his shoulder as he walks away in disappointment. {{BATSMAN}} c Mandeep b {{BOWLER}} 31(19) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! {{BOWLER}} strikes. What a big wicket too. Quite uncharacteristic from {{BATSMAN}} to get out to one of his favorite shots. Took a step down the track and whipped that with lots of bottom hand power, failed to keep it down and found CSK's best fielder Jadeja at mid-on. He judges it beautifully and slides to take it with two hands. If there was one fielder, {{BATSMAN}} didn't want the ball to go to, then it must have been Jadeja. {{BATSMAN}} is livid with himself, bangs the bat hard into his pad and trudges off. The CSK contingent erupt. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 18(15) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Timbah! Turns back and points to someone in the crowd. Huge wicket for CSK. The timeout as it does so often brings a wicket along with it. Nothing but a dart from {{BOWLER}}, hard to get under it and sweep, {{BATSMAN}} does just that, kneels down to play the sweep and is beaten by the length and pace, misses it altogether and the ball takes a deflection off the back thigh before crashing into the stumps. The partnership is broken and CSK have an opening. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 26(25) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! No way. He didn't just do that. It's all about the Avengers now, but AB is the only one keeping DC alive. A toss-up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets down the wicket and bottom-hand swats that flat towards deep mid-wicket, seems to have cleared it till the last moment until Superman arrives from Krypton to pluck that out of thin air. Leaps and grabs that one-handed. Absolutely ridiculous. The right foot was in fact extremely close to the rope and he landed on the right foot and had enough balance at the age of 34 to hold on and he was dancing like a teenager. Absolute magic. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 37(24) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! This is a soft soft dismissal. I am afraid to say, it is not the ideal track for the opening match of the IPL. {{BOWLER}} gives this one lots of air, it sticks in the wicket, comes slowly and bounces extra off the deck. {{BATSMAN}} was on the back-foot, he wanted to work it to the on-side. He closes the face of the blade early, it hits his leading edge and pops up in the air. Bhajji takes a sitter of sitters. {{TEAM}} in a spot of bother. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 9(8) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! Is there MS Dhoni's mind behind this dismissal? CSK fans would know. In 2010, he had a straightish mid-off to dismiss the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} in the final. Now RPS got a very straight long-off - a field placement you normally don't see in cricket - and {{BATSMAN}} hits it straight to him. This was full and in the slot from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} was in the mood to murder the ball, he went hard, hit it flat and hard, but little did he know that he fell in the trap. It's 65 for 5 now. {{BATSMAN}} c Manoj Tiwary b {{BOWLER}} 7(3) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! A big shout for lbw as {{BATSMAN}} is struck on the pad. Not given. {{BOWLER}} persuades Dhoni to go for the review! Legal ball. It was the googly and {{BATSMAN}} was pressing forward for the push. Is the impact outside off? Before that, was there an inside edge? Yes, confirmed by UltraEdge. The ball brushed the pad and carried to first slip. A review for lbw, given out caught! Got to give credit to {{BOWLER}} here. He forced MS to go upstairs and it's a successful one. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Milne!! {{BOWLER}}, {{BOWLER}}, {{BOWLER}}! And he gets {{BATSMAN}} on a day he had blown his side away ten years back. Had bowled a similar full ball earlier in the over to {{BATSMAN}}, but the batsman had resisted then. Not this time. It's {{BATSMAN}}. Gujarat need 77 off 33, so he takes this on. Tries the slog-sweep, fails to get under the ball and offers a steepler to deep mid-wicket. Milne there, who catches it, doing a much better job than he did with the ball earlier. {{BATSMAN}} c Milne b {{BOWLER}} 72(44) [4s-2 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Moeen Ali!! Holed out! 134.4kph, full on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} stands outside leg-stump and backs himself to clear the ropes. The bat turns at the point of impact and robs all the timing. It comes off the bottom part of the bat too. Moeen takes a couple of steps forward from long-on to complete the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Moeen Ali b {{BOWLER}} 32(28) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! Edged and caught! The perfect start for KXIP, a nothing shot from {{BATSMAN}} and he has to take the long walk back to the hut. {{BOWLER}} shortened his length outside off and got the ball to shape away slightly, drew {{BATSMAN}} into playing at that. He was looking to run it down towards third man, gets a thick edge and it's an easy catch to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}}' comeback is a short one, the Daredevils have been rocked early. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Corey Anderson!! Corey Anderson didn't have to move an inch. Straight as a dolly. 140ks short ball. {{BATSMAN}}, with the kind of form he is in, looks to tonk it over deep square with a pull. He might have timed that well, but with 140ks thudding your bat, you can't clear the fence every day. Deep square plucks it reverse-cupped. Replays show it came off the toe end. {{BATSMAN}} c Corey Anderson b {{BOWLER}} 8(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! {{BOWLER}} comes into the attack and gets the breakthrough straightaway. Got three crucial wickets in the previous match too. Invites the batsman by tossing this one outside off and {{BATSMAN}} falls for it. Chips it towards cover where Suryakumar takes a catch diving forward. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 12(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tripathi!! {{BOWLER}} strikes first ball. It's not his best delivery, but he isn't complaining. Slightly on the shorter side at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} quickly jumps back to pull it away but he skies it off a thick top-edge. Easily taken by Tripathi coming in from deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Tripathi b {{BOWLER}} 30(29) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! It's that man again - {{BOWLER}}, who strikes for Rajasthan. He usually does well against {{TEAM}} and has got a wicket in his first over. Flighted just outside off - the googly which spun back in - {{BATSMAN}} was alerted by his partner about this threat, still he went low to sweep and failed to connect. The impact was in-line and the only question was whether it was hitting the stumps. {{BOWLER}} was proved right and {{TEAM}} have lost their first wicket. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 8(7) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jaiswal!! Catching practice for the teenager. {{BATSMAN}}'s poor run of form continues. Was fullish and in the area where {{BATSMAN}} naturally fllicks/whips but with {{BOWLER}} there's always extra pace and skid off the surface. {{BATSMAN}} played it slightly later than he would have liked and skews it off the inside half straight to mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Jaiswal b {{BOWLER}} 5(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant! That's a shot of panic, and lack of faith in his technique. 142.7km/h of oomph on that one, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and tries to use the pace, attempting to steer it away towards the third man area - gets a feather of a top-edge to Pant who holds onto the simplest of catches! More pressure on Agarwal now! {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 20(14) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! Okay, the slowness of the surface is really coming to the fore here. After Rohit, {{BATSMAN}} toe-ends one. And it elicits a mighty roar from Ngidi who took some punishment from the left-han{{BATSMAN}}r. Back of a length around off, stops on {{BATSMAN}} as he heaves it straight to midwicket. {{BOWLER}} might've rolled his fingers across it as well. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 33(20) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! In the air.....gone! Went miles up in the air but unfortunately for {{BATSMAN}}, he hasn't got the distance on this one. It was banged in short by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull. Struck him high on the blade and flew towards deep mid-wicket where Axar settled under the skier. Easy catch. {{BATSMAN}} was trying to force the pace a bit but just couldn't execute the stroke well. {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 13(13)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! A failure to last the duration. A massively long banana peel here that Kolkata just couldn't get rid of. And the innings ends with the light up of the zing bails. {{BATSMAN}} exposes his stumps, gallops away and whips angrily. To connect with nothing but thin air. The full slower ball meanwhile makes a real mess of the furniture. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! And again! Hold on, he is caught in the deep. {{BOWLER}} tossed up again, as if challenging {{BATSMAN}} to go after it again. The latter took the offer and slogged across the line. It seemed he had made a good connection but there was a speed-breaker at the deep mid-wicket fence. Rahane timed his jump to perfection and plucked it from above his head. The captain goes and {{TEAM}} are now in a spot of bother. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 24(19) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has struck first ball and it's been a free-fall for the Daredevils. This was the quicker ball from {{BOWLER}}, pitched on off and went straight on, Karun was playing for a bit of turn, ended up playing inside the line and missed it completely. The ball curled past the outside edge and crashed into the off-stump, Karun looks back in dismay and walks off. DD are in a heap of trouble now. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(10) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Gone! That is the problem with {{BATSMAN}}. He will give you those cute little 30s and 40s but never a man for a big innings. Nothing but a leg-break with a hint of turn, {{BATSMAN}} stays flat-footed and has a poke at it, very casual in his approach and the ball finds a feather of the outside edge. Pant does well to hold on to the catch as it almost popped out. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 39(29) [4s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Now then, now then. Is this a bit of a turning point? Look at the turn for {{BOWLER}}. Pitched just outside off stump and spun big, sucked {{BATSMAN}} into the drive and he went for a big drive targetting cover. He couldn't counter for the spin and got an edge, Pant somehow managed to cling on. {{BATSMAN}} walks without waiting for the umpire. He's done his part, but he's livid with himself because he normally loves finishing games when set. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 70(40) [4s-7 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Goswami!! Brain-melt from {{BATSMAN}}. Nothing more than that. Suddenly he has kicked the door wide open for SRH to come back into the game. {{BOWLER}}'s last over and with AB gone, he decides to play a cute reverse paddle, when he was hitting them so well straight down the ground. Such a low-percentage shot and one must applaud Goswami's take. On the rebound and it was a clear deflection too. {{BATSMAN}} walked as soon as Goswami took it. That shot could potentially send {{TEAM}} out of the tournament. But {{BATSMAN}} plays that way and has got out many times previously very softly. Fantastic innings nonetheless. {{BATSMAN}} c Goswami b {{BOWLER}} 65(34) [4s-2 6s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! End of {{BATSMAN}} and it is for a duck. Backed away to lift this shortish ball, which was rising, could only loft it straight up and Hardik moved to his left at extra cover to grab the skier. Not the sort of shot to be trying in the first over when the ball is bouncing. But that's how {{BATSMAN}} plays. Mid-off left it for Hardik and that was a good pressure catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 0(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nadeem!! Short ball consumes {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} picks up his first wicket. A lifter angled at the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull. The ball got big on him and he manages a fat top-edge that went up in the air. Nadeem from fine leg darted in and snaffled it with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Nadeem b {{BOWLER}} 10(5) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That's not very smart from {{BATSMAN}}, his flattened leg-stump tells him the same. The very first ball he faces from {{BOWLER}}, he tries to reverse-sweep him premeditatedly. It was too full to be doing that. The ball slid on under his bat and crashed his wicket away. Off you go, says {{BOWLER}} with a twirl of his wrist. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Avesh Khan!! Collision, a pop out and taken in the end. Pant and Avesh almost made a meal of it. {{BOWLER}} sees the funny side of it. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to heave it into the cow corner fence and the top-edge went straight up towards point, Pant ran across even as Avesh steadied himself under it, the ball hit Pant's gloves and then popped up, Avesh was the first to react and he claims the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Avesh Khan b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ankit Soni!! {{BOWLER}}'s pace has devoured another one. Good pacy bumper that kept climbing on to {{BATSMAN}}, who wanted to hook this one. Was hit on the splice and hence no power behind the shot. The man at short fine leg has to move a few yards to his right to make things a little tricky for Pune. {{BATSMAN}} c Ankit Soni b {{BOWLER}} 4(2) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ashwin!! Excellent final over from {{BOWLER}}. Removed two set batsmen and this could be the game for KXIP? Once again kept it wide from {{BATSMAN}}'s reach who went chasing after the delivery and much like Smith, he too toe-ended it into the air. Ash runs back from extra cover and clings onto a dolly of a catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Ashwin b {{BOWLER}} 30(25) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Four singles in a row and bam, we have a wicket. Times have changed. Rotating strike is no longer enough. Bhuvi tries his luck with the shorter length again but takes the pace off, which is the reason why {{BATSMAN}} clubs it straight to Rashid at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Rashid Khan b {{BOWLER}} 16(17) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! 146.8kph, {{BOWLER}} goes full, the line is around off, {{BATSMAN}} wants to slog across the line. The ball pops up off the leading edge and Rohit completes the formalities in the extra cover region. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 20(9) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Trapped in the crease and plumb again! This is just unbelievable. Some of the {{TEAM}} fans, however minimal their number, are shellshocked. {{BOWLER}} pitches this up, gets some movement off the pitch again and the ball cuts back in with {{BATSMAN}} caught in the crease. It hits him right in front of middle, the height not a problem. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! There's that early wicket that {{BOWLER}} is so used to. Takes three balls to take his first wicket in IPL. {{BATSMAN}} preempts the reverse-sweep but loses his balance altogether in doing so. {{BOWLER}} ripped the ball a little extra with his index finger, meaning the ball was drifting in and gaining pace off the deck. Skids on and pins {{BATSMAN}} on the thigh. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! He probably won't bowl a better yorker than this one. That's just perfect from Ben {{BOWLER}} as he cannons it on middle and has {{BATSMAN}} playing over it. Smashes into the base of middle stump. Phew, what drama! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 58(43) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! No Pollard but {{BATSMAN}}'s wicket do. A big fat birthday gift as the top-scorer of the game departs playing a needless dab. Went for a fish outside off and ended up netting himself. Karthik leaped up and grabbed that out of thin air with aplomb. Can GL roar back into this? {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 70(44) [4s-9 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Warner!! If it wasn't over, it's definitely over now. {{BATSMAN}} falls and {{TEAM}} are staring at humiliation. Length ball and it was there to be smacked - {{BATSMAN}} leant into the drive and drilled it towards cover - didn't bother to keep it down - straight into the hands of Warner who made it look easy - a head-high catch and he clasps it with ease. The misery continues for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Warner b {{BOWLER}} 3(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! {{BOWLER}} gets rid of the set batsman. {{BATSMAN}} was looking so good, until he played this shot. Once again he goes down on his knee to play the sweep shot but fails to keep it on the ground. Dwayne Bravo stationed at deep square leg takes a regulation catch and Delhi sink further. They'll have two new batsmen at the crease now and Imran Tahir is yet to bowl his first over. Interesting passage of play on the cards. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Bravo b {{BOWLER}} 27(24) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Lewis!! {{BATSMAN}} falls into the trap. There's a deep cover in place for the lofted hit and {{BATSMAN}} has found the man. Low full-toss outside off, it looked like {{BATSMAN}} was in two minds, whether to go full-blast or not, eventually he chips it to the West Indian on the fence. That is such a massive wicket and MI's ploy has worked. {{BATSMAN}} c Lewis b {{BOWLER}} 26(21) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Quite a ripper from {{BOWLER}}, pitching leg and hitting off. Along the way, it brought {{BATSMAN}} tentatively forward, then beat him with the dip, before spinning past his outside edge. Mumbai Indians are all over the Capitals. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! Gone this time. Thakur juggles once and takes it on the second attempt. Short and got big on DK outside off, he still tries to force the upper cut and hits it flat and straight to the fielder at square third man. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 12(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nabi!! Gone! The promotion does not work out for Delhi. Another knuckle and this time there is no bounce to save {{BATSMAN}}, he is completely fooled by it and just leaves his bat hanging in front, the ball pops towards cover and Nabi completes the dolly. {{BATSMAN}} c Nabi b {{BOWLER}} 5(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by D Arcy Short!! Excellent catch! We've seen a few crackers already in this match and here is another one. The pressure was telling on the aggressive {{BATSMAN}} and with a spinner on, he decides to take a chance. Slogs this over mid-wicket but only gets height on it and not the distance. Well, actually almost cleared Short who took the catch calmly and ensured that his foot didn't touch the ropes. Smart work. RR are clawing their way back here. {{BATSMAN}} c D Arcy Short b {{BOWLER}} 4(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Shankar Run Out!! 1 run completed. Has Vijay Shankar run himself out? Has the dive saved him, NO - he's well short and RCB have a second wicket. {{BATSMAN}} got lucky, but his partner wasn't. {{BOWLER}} followed {{BATSMAN}} as he backed away, induced a thick outside edge on the heave - was in the air for a long time, but dropped right in between AB - who was running back from cover and Hetmyer - running in from long-off. Shankar wanted the second run, but didn't spot that his partner wasn't coming back - stranded in the middle, he made a dash towards his end, put in the dive, but all in vain. Shankar run out (Hetmyer/Parthiv Patel) 9(3) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Failed twice at the cut shot in the previous over from Chahar, and now {{BATSMAN}} has perished to it. The line's too close to him this time as it skids in from round the wicket, absolutely no room to free the arms. Chops it back onto the stumps off the under-edge! {{BOWLER}} is having a ball out there. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Vijay Shankar!! Loopy googly on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} predictably goes for his almighty heave over mid-wicket which has brought him much success over the years. Not tonight though as he flat-bats it straight down the throat of Vijay Shankar at cow corner. That's the end of a the most un-{{BATSMAN}} innings of all time. An innings of more than ten balls, with a strike-rate below hundred. *Shaking my head* {{BATSMAN}} c Vijay Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 15(18) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The batsman preempts by dancing down the track but he lost his dancing shoes in the process as the slower ball doled out deceives him. The wily old {{BOWLER}} rolled his fingers over the ball and the batsman trying for a cross batted swipe completely missed the ball due to the lack of pace on it. SRH get the first blood. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 14(11) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Bang on top of off-stump. These bowlers are helping themselves to some good wickets here. Three for {{BOWLER}} now. Cuts his fingers across the ball while bowling it into the pitch, it doesn't bounce as much as {{BATSMAN}} wants. Right under his swipe. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! This is reckless from {{BATSMAN}}. Just treks down to heave it across. Has no clue about where it has pitched. The ball scoots under his bat and the keeper does not have buttery gloves.. so that is the end of {{BATSMAN}}'s IPL this year. {{BATSMAN}} st Vishnu Vinod b {{BOWLER}} 3(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Smith!! That's a dolly and Smith has gobbled up his Australian teammate. On a good length and angling across the left-hander, Shardul bowled this one with a scrambled seam. The ball once again looked like it stopped on the batsman - {{BATSMAN}} was committed on the drive, couldn't keep it down, went off the splice of the bat and spoons a simple catch to Smith at mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Smith b {{BOWLER}} 10(13) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by M Pan{{BOWLER}}y!! It's all over. {{TEAM}} have capitulated for the lowest IPL score ever. This time {{BOWLER}}'s outswinger finds the edge as {{BATSMAN}} prods forward. The ball goes right between second and first slip. Both dive for it. But Pan{{BOWLER}}y, at second slip, pouches it well. {{BATSMAN}} c M Pan{{BOWLER}}y b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Washington Sundar!! The slower ball has worked. {{BATSMAN}} drags it straight to long-on. He backed away looking for the big hit, maybe over mid-off, and {{BOWLER}} followed him with a leg-cutter to deny him the room. The lack of pace on the ball meant that it didn't come on as well as {{BATSMAN}} wanted and he ended up dragging it off the inside half. Simple catch for Sundar running in. {{BATSMAN}} c Washington Sundar b {{BOWLER}} 17(13) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tripathi!! That's gone straight up. Who wants it? Tripathi is the one settling under it at deep mid-wicket, and he takes it neatly. A real skier. Slower ball which extracts spongy bounce and takes a thick top-edge as {{BATSMAN}} slogs. Second for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Tripathi b {{BOWLER}} 10(7) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hooda!! Hangs the ball in the air by bowling it slower, {{BATSMAN}} fails to control the hack and holes out at deep mid. He inner-halved the stroke and never timed it. The ball was tossed up at 82.9kph and all the power in the shot had to be invested by the batter. That is where he lost his shape trying to hit it hard and the length also was dragged back. Huge wicket for SRH. {{BATSMAN}} c Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 11(14) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Searles!! Wicket for {{BOWLER}}. That should get back his confidence, especially after what Ishan Kishan did in the previous game. Switched to round the wicket and fired the full delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} moved a bit and lofted it to long-off. The length was tad too full and hence {{BATSMAN}} could not get underneath it. A well-judged catch by Searles, who timed his jump to perfection. {{BATSMAN}} c Searles b {{BOWLER}} 19(11) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! {{BOWLER}} gets a wicket off his very first ball and out comes his little jig. An off-pace delivery at 101kph from a short of length. {{BATSMAN}} was a touch early into his pull shot and ended up dragging it straight to Jaddu at backward square leg. {{BATSMAN}} c Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 29(35) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! There's the wicket and there's the man for RCB. Kohli is absolutely pumped and rightly so. Must say it's a poor shot from {{BATSMAN}}. The leggie from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} looked to send it to mars with a I-do-not-care-one-bit heave-ho on the leg-side, the flight and lack of pace meant {{BATSMAN}} couldn't get under it and the leg peg has been shattered. Brave from {{BOWLER}} to toss it up and invite the big hit. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 61(43) [4s-6 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sandeep {{BOWLER}}!! A compulsive pull brings about the downfall. The ball right at the neck and {{BATSMAN}} cannot resist not throwing his bat at it. Takes his eyes off though and trusts his instincts in executing the hook. The instincts only manage a top edge, a balloon that gains enough elevation but into the palms of Sandeep behind square. {{BATSMAN}} c Sandeep {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 12(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! Big wicket for RPS. Baz was looking dangerous. He tried to go over covers by backing away. It was on the stumps and all {{BATSMAN}} could do was slice it to Rahane at deep backward point. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 45(27) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stoinis!! {{BATSMAN}}'s streaky innings comes to an end and it's that man - {{BOWLER}}, who takes the wicket once again. This was another knuckle ball that angled across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to heave it over mid-wicket, doesn't cover for the angle, gets it high on the bat and spoons it over mid-on. Stoinis was the fielder there - he kept his eyes on the ball as he back tracked and completed a simple catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Stoinis b {{BOWLER}} 20(12) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The pull, the famed {{BATSMAN}} pull, has brought about his downfall. Problem is the length isn't short at all. He's just trying to manufacture it out of nothing. Fails badly as this skids through onto his back pad and crashes into leg stump. May have been fooled by the trajectory actually. {{BOWLER}} kept it quite flat, pushing it through off the front of his hand. May have caused him to believe it was shorter than it was. {{BATSMAN}}'s furious with himself. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 33(21) [4s-1 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Lewis!! For a moment, {{BATSMAN}} seemed to have got hold of the shot - but he got plenty of height but not the distance, good catch at deep mid-wicket from Lewis - backtracking as he was, it was the slower ball and that did {{BATSMAN}} in, had to drag his shot and didn't get the requisite power behind it. Walks off to a standing ovation and after the customary check for a possible front-foot no-ball. {{BATSMAN}} c Lewis b {{BOWLER}} 76(45) [4s-6 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! Huge, huge wicket. With 18 balls to go, {{BATSMAN}} could have produced a match-defining innings. Clever cricket from {{BOWLER}} though, rolled his fingers across the ball at the last instant, {{BATSMAN}} had made room to go for a big heave-ho, went through even though there was no pace on the ball. The ball went high up and the cool, calm Samson was under it at long-on. Taken comfortably. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 26(29) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! There it is. Third hat-trick of the season. He is chuffed to bits. Is almost on his knees celebrating the occasion. Also, reaches 100 wickets in T20s. Once more the off-speed delivery on back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} stayed leg-side and tried to flat-bat it, spliced it towards extra cover and Tiwary made no mistake. He's been terrifich with his slower balls. {{BATSMAN}} c Manoj Tiwary b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! This is a big wicket -- make no mistake about it. {{BOWLER}} was bowling from over the wicket, angles this in to cut the room on this preempted hoick over mid-wicket from {{BATSMAN}}. There's no arm-swinging space in front, the ball skids on to make it worse and {{BATSMAN}} holes out to the fielder at long-on, something Kevin Pietersen is ecstatic about on air. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 4(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! Gone! {{BATSMAN}} does not make a mark at Eden Gardens. Another cutter and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to heave it into the crowd, does not generate enough power and mistimes it towards deep mid-wicket, where the safest hands are under it. Rahane runs to his right and takes a good catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 5(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has broken through. Just what RCB needed of him. It's the drift that gets {{BATSMAN}} here. Curves in nicely towards leg-stump, slips past the inside edge into the front pad, before ricocheting onto the stumps. Brilliant from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 29(29) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bairstow!! Brought back and Bhuvi strikes first ball. It is the in-form {{BATSMAN}} who has to depart. Short of length and bit of extra lift in the corridor around off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} tries to steer to third man but is undone by the bounce, the outside edge carries at a nice height for Bairstow. {{BATSMAN}} c Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 11(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned him up!! That was the ferocious inswinger and the batsman without covering the line of the ball looks to play across the line and misses. The sticks go cartwheeling and the bowler takes off with a hand in the air. He does it so often, does {{BOWLER}}. Superb bit of attacking bowling as he got the ball to land on the sticks and put the batsman on a tight leash. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Yuvraj Run Out!! Third umpire called in for a run-out check but Yuvi has already started walking. Oh jeez! Yuvraj is nowhere in the frame. Goner! Unnecessary wicket. There was never a run there, to be honest. \"Crazy running\" was the comment from Haydos on air. There was a mix-up between both batsmen in the last over as well. Dropped in front of point, they set off for a single. Yuvi's bat got stuck in the turf and a flat, neat throw from Lewis to the keeper. Kishan does the rest. Yuvraj run out (Lewis/Ishan Kishan) 14(14) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chawla!! The bonus off a half-tracker. {{BOWLER}} produces another sitting up off-spinner, but that manages to confuse Watto whether to go uppishly or keep it along the floor. Ends up doing a bit of both, dragging it in the end and picking out square leg perfectly. {{BATSMAN}} c Chawla b {{BOWLER}} 17(9) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Vijay Shankar!! Seam-up full toss that tailed into the right-hander. {{BATSMAN}} goes for his favourite shot - the slog over mid-wicket. Goes hard and ends up mistiming it. Finds the man at deep mid-wicket to perfection. Shankar didn't have to move an inch. {{BATSMAN}} c Vijay Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 5(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Another reverse sweep dismissal! {{BATSMAN}} started his innings with a similar one but this time, like Munro earlier in the afternoon, misses it to be trapped LBW. {{BATSMAN}} tries to repeat the stroke but ends up losing his balance and is all over the place as he gets pinged before the stumps. Looked dead plumb. Probably didn't pick the leg break at all. {{TEAM}} chipping away at the wickets here at the back end. DD need a strong finish. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 9(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! A peach from {{BOWLER}}. He recorded the worst bowling figures of the season the other night (4-0-59-0), but he's started with a lovely nut tonight. The hard-hitting Baz {{BATSMAN}} is walking back with just a solitary run to his name. {{BOWLER}} angled this short of length delivery into the right-hander from wide of the crease, the ball moved away late, just enough movement to take the outside edge of {{BATSMAN}}'s bat as he was looking to defend away from the body. Pant dives to his right and takes a good catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Buttler Run Out!! {{BATSMAN}} slams his bat in disgust. Error in judgement and he ends up selling his partner. Just taps the ball to cover and sets off, Samson runs forward, picks it up clean and smashes the stumps. Buttler was nowhere to be seen in the frame. There was no single there, Buttler looked ominous, gee! Buttler run out (Samson) 28(18) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Lynn!! The knuckle's fooling enough. And Chris Lynn - miked up and talking to the on-air comms - is still awake enough to judge the miscued chipped loop going over his head to lap it reverse-cupped without fuss. So it was full, and {{BATSMAN}}, early into his flick, ends up without control. And succumbs to give {{BOWLER}} his maiden IPL wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Lynn b {{BOWLER}} 2(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} draws first blood! SRH needed this and not surprisingly, it's their star spinner who does the job. The slider that shoots through a touch low, {{BATSMAN}} wasn't anticipating the lack of bounce and went through with a pull. Got pinged on the pad and that's as plumb as it gets. End of a smooth opening stand but {{TEAM}} haven't really been allowed to get away. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 18(21) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! This is disaster of the highest class. {{BATSMAN}} flicks it to mid-wicket and calls for a quick single, Priyam Garg barely responded and {{BATSMAN}} was left stranded mid-pitch. There was never a single there and Rayudu at mid-wicket had all the time in the world to lob the ball to Dhoni who does the rest. He looks upset, not sure if it was his call, but having played it to the right of mid-wicket, there was no single on there. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Rayudu/Dhoni) 9(13) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} is jumping in joy and he has every reason to be so. Throws in a slider and he has beaten {{BATSMAN}} all ends up, there was a huge gap between bat (on the lazy drive) and pad and the ball snuck through at a cunning pace to rattle middle and leg. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Lynn!! What an unlucky dismissal this for Evin {{BATSMAN}}. Was a short delivery on leg, {{BATSMAN}} tried to drag it away but got beaten and struck on the pads. The momentum of the bat was such that as the ball lobs after clipping the pads, it flicks the back of the willow and deflects towards short third man. Lynn is the man who takes it. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Lynn b {{BOWLER}} 18(13) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! Gone. Hit a six earlier in the over and now perishes in trying to drive along the ground. That's modern cricket in a nutshell. A bit of drift away from the batsman, which is why {{BATSMAN}} stretched his front foot right across, but a bit of spin did him in. Something that you didn't expect out of {{BOWLER}} but he's produced it. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 11(11) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Maxwell!! Another chip and this time {{BATSMAN}} hasn't timed it that well. It was a low full toss angled in from round the wicket, more power was needed but not sure even that would have helped, Maxwell runs in from deep mid-wicket and dives forward to take the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Maxwell b {{BOWLER}} 12(6) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! No. no. no! You don't want to see that if you are a {{BATSMAN}} fan! That was a painful stay, but credit to {{BOWLER}}. He troubled {{BATSMAN}} and deserved this wicket. Was the leggie, probably that diagonal over the wicket angle is troubling him - he was bowling most deliveries to {{BATSMAN}} from that angle. However, this was bowled with a conventional run-up, pitching on a length and turning away, {{BATSMAN}} loses one hand on the handle and chips it to cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 3(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Washington Sundar!! Break and a wicket. How many times have we heard that? Even Pathan perished first ball after the first time-out and now it is {{BATSMAN}}. Once more {{BOWLER}} resorts to the slower {{BATSMAN}}livery, the Kiwi is completely {{BATSMAN}}ceived as he closes the bat face and the leading edge pops up to backward point. {{BATSMAN}} c Washington Sundar b {{BOWLER}} 36(19) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! {{BOWLER}} gets rid of {{BATSMAN}}. He shimmies down the wicket and lofts the delivery high up in the air. The ball went miles up in the air but it could travel as far as deep mid-off. du Plessis charges in from the deep, settles underneath the skier and takes it safely. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 24(20) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! That's been skied up .. and McCullum takes a really good catch around 5 yards inside the ropes. It was there to be slogged from a length, but {{BATSMAN}} went through it too early and lobbed a leading edge up which surprisingly travelled quite a fair bit. McCullum skirts to his right from long-on, runs backwards and grabs it with both hands while tumbling over. {{BATSMAN}} c Brendon McCullum b {{BOWLER}} 25(15) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! What was that? A half-hearted appeal for caught-behind, the umpire doesn't raise his finger, but {{BATSMAN}} walks. Well, CSK have the breakthrough. And, it's a big wicket. A harmless ball sliding down leg from a back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} gets a glove on it, trying to tuck. The Jamaican stood for a while and decided to go off. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The part-timer gets AB de Villiers and Virat {{BATSMAN}} in consecutive balls. Floats a seam-up yorker which slips under {{BATSMAN}}'s bat and rattles the stumps. {{BOWLER}} is pumped as he punches the air in delight. He'll be telling his grandchildren about this. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 31(33) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! This was coming. {{BATSMAN}} was struggling against {{BOWLER}} and he perishes looking to play a wild stroke. NCN darted it full and on the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and wants to heave it over the on-side. Doesn't bring the bat anywhere close to the ball and the it strikes the base of middle. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 21(27) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! It was a matter of {{BOWLER}} getting it on target. Another knuckle ball and {{BATSMAN}} slogs without a clue in the world, the ball arrives later to mess up the stumps. Is it going to be a double wicket maiden for {{BOWLER}}? {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The drop doesn't cost SRH at all in the end. Atrocious stroke from {{BATSMAN}} though and is undone by some wily bowling from {{BOWLER}}. Slower ball and {{BATSMAN}} was early into the sweep by moving across the stumps. Took a piece of the bat, the pad and then disturbed the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} stood there in disbelief, probably wondering how he got out. I reckon he should wonder why he tried this shot. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 8(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by K Paul!! Keemo Paul is like air. He is everywhere. An easy catch around the mid-off region. Length delivery and was heaved away off the toe-end of the blade, never went anywhere and the catch was taken easily. {{TEAM}} going down like a lead balloon here. Totally messed up the chase in the second part of the innings. {{BATSMAN}} c K Paul b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! No, not his night. But he's gotten {{TEAM}} off to a flier. {{BOWLER}} is relieved and delighted - throws the ball away after taking the catch in frustration. 127.1ks short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} looks to pull it to deep mid-wicket, the top-edge takes it straight up and {{BOWLER}} moves to his right to reverse cup it. KXIP needed that badly. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 46(22) [4s-5 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Rahul Chahar!! With 4 needed, he goes for the glory hit and falls. Slow cutter, {{BATSMAN}} went for the all-hands loft over cover and found Chahar in the deep. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Rahul Chahar b {{BOWLER}} 26(14) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Not happening this time. Similar kind of delivery and similar kind of stroke from {{BATSMAN}}, but he finds the man at long-on. {{BOWLER}} bowls the off-break with a dragged back length, {{BATSMAN}} with his weight back looks to muscle it over Gill, doesn't get enough and the youngsters takes it calmly. {{BATSMAN}} c Shubman Gill b {{BOWLER}} 14(11) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! One shot too many and {{TEAM}} batsmen are throwing away their wickets - trying to match Gayle's power. Not a smart shot from {{BATSMAN}}, ran down the track, got himself too close to the ball, went through with the lofted on-drive, plenty of height but not the distance. Shaw settled underneath the skier at deep mid-wicket and holds on. What are {{TEAM}} trying to achieve? This isn't a 200 wicket for sure. {{BATSMAN}} c Prithvi Shaw b {{BOWLER}} 7(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Leg stump out of the ground. Length delivery on the leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} slogs and misses. Oh {{BOWLER}} is limping after delivering that ball. Looks like the hammie. He's stretching it. Hope it's not too serious as he wants to continue. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! Just Jadeja things! Takes an absolute specky, at deep mid-wicket, diving parallel to the ground to his right and just when he was about to skid onto the boundary triangles, tosses the ball to Faf (running from long-on) to complete the catch. Was loopier and the line teased {{BATSMAN}} to go for the big one, attempts a heave, only to be bettered by the fielding brilliance of {{TEAM}}. The KKR management won't be too disappointed and we could see {{BATSMAN}} play more of such roles for the rest of the IPL. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 17(9) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! It's all over. RCB start their campaign with a victory and it's their second successive win over {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} gets pace but this time there isn't enough width and all he could do with the incoming angle was miscue the pull into safe hands of Kohli at long-on, who took a splendid catch sprinting across the boundary rope to his right. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 9(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! {{BATSMAN}} fails to get a fifty in his comeback match in the IPL. There was pressure on him after getting such a heavy paycheck from {{TEAM}} this year in the auction. And he has certainly lived upto the expectations. It was a slower delivery wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} goes back and wanted to pump it over deep mid-wicket. He fails to time it as well as he would have liked and ends up gifting at catch to the younger Pandya at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 47(32) [4s-7 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Off pole this time. {{BOWLER}} likes hitting the stumps and we have seen a lot of that in the domestic cricket. A delivery that was too good for {{BATSMAN}}. 144ks coming in from slightly wide of the crease and {{BATSMAN}} is opened up by the angle, plays outside the line of the delivery and loses his off pole. Surely he's not 100 percent. A normal {{BATSMAN}} would have smashed that full ball over the rope! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! Killer blow! Shardul Thakur has made a tough catch look very simple. {{BATSMAN}}'s cameo comes to an end and {{TEAM}} have lost an important wicket. Length delivery, straighter at the stumps and jerked his lower body, unfurling a whippy-pull uppishly towards deep square leg. Thakur ran swiftly to his right, cushions it neatly and slides before completing the catch. They have also called for a time-out. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 25(13) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! They're falling. {{BATSMAN}} tries forcing the run-rate, but against {{BOWLER}}, seriously? Gets a floater around off, tries going downtown with a full-blooded swing. Mistimes, and Dhawan's waiting at long-off, with a pre-loaded thigh slap celebration ready to come out. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 10(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Duck. Duck. And Ashton {{BATSMAN}}'s Indian journey after the miracle at Mohali has been a real disaster. {{BOWLER}} - meanwhile - is doing what he does best, fire it in quick, dead straight on the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't help his cause either, shuffling a little too much and then getting beaten for pace as well as he tries to tuck it away. The mother of plumb. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! Stunner from Samson. Wow! The replays show it to be even better. Should be in the top five list. Full and angled in, {{BATSMAN}} whips it with plenty of bottom hand towards deep mid-wicket, Samson runs across to his right, but the ball seemed to be out his reach, that is when he decides to put in the full length dive and the ball sticks in his right hand when he is parallel to the ground. Simply superb! {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 36(21) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has his revenge. Sweet. Rip roaring yorker, angling on leg. {{BATSMAN}} is beaten for sheer pace (145.6kph). Couldn't get his bat down in time, the ball slams his pad and deflected back onto the stumps to clatter the middle stump. {{TEAM}} losing steam towards the end. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(2) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That's it. Get on with the handshakes. Rohit's killed it by persisting with {{BOWLER}}. And {{BOWLER}}'s killed it with simple sheer lack-of-pace. He's leg-cuttered it in full, angling in on leg-stump, and {{BATSMAN}}'s clearly beaten on his hoick of sorts with his bat going through with the swing only to hear the rattle of death behind. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(11) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! WW.W. {{BOWLER}}'s putting up a spectacle here, courtesy {{BATSMAN}}'s top-edged slice, barely clearing the infield as Iyer - the extra cover - runs backwards and takes it without fuss. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Negi!! That brings an end to {{BATSMAN}}'s struggle. Finally! This innings has actually taken the life out of the chase. Too much to do! Guess even Russell can't do anything from here on. A short ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for a pull and mistimes it horribly. Negi at deep square leg takes a comfortable catch and out walks Dre Russ to a huge cheer from the crowd. {{BATSMAN}} c Negi b {{BOWLER}} 9(20) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! Pouched at slip by Dhawan. {{BOWLER}} jogs away with his arms spread. Oh he loves bowling at the Wankhede. The extra fizz off the surface works wonders for him. Pushed through on a good length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} wafts at it and perishes to the turn and bite. SRH on a roll. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 7(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Gonzo! Terrible misjudgement from {{BATSMAN}} and he pays the price. Made room to a slider from {{BOWLER}}, ended up getting too close for comfort as it zips through and crashes his front pad first. The appeal was spontaneous and only question there was whether it was pad first as {{BATSMAN}} did make contact with the bat later. Umpire Nitin Menon was sure about it and raised his finger. {{BATSMAN}} also knew it and started walking. HawkEye says that it's smashing the off-stump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 18(20) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Uthappa!! Tries to go for the third maximum on the trot and perishes. Hey bowlers, need a wicket? Bowl half-trackers. That's what {{BOWLER}} did. He's bowled two and has two wickets. Was the short leg-break from the left-arm spinner, {{BATSMAN}} spotted it and went deep in his crease. Pull too hard and loses his shape. Miscued and picked Uthappa at deep mid-wicket. A big wicket, this. {{BATSMAN}} c Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 47(22) [4s-3 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} goes for the big hoick, gets hit on the back leg. KKR players go up for an lbw appeal and the umpire has raised his finger. {{BATSMAN}} decides to review it. Legal ball. No bat involved. What does the HawkEye say. Umpire's call on hitting wickets. The on-field call stays. {{BATSMAN}} has to walk back. While going back, {{BATSMAN}} has a word or two with the umpire. He knocked down the bails with his bat at the bowler's end too. It was an in-slanter from round the wicket and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to play it across the line. Missed it and was struck on the back leg in front of middle. The ball-tracker showed it to be clipping leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 12(9) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Faulkner!! End of a good, good innings. They are checking for the no-ball but {{BOWLER}} ushers us to \"ooooohhh\" and then the back foot somehow manages to be halfway behind the line. Anyway, coming to the wicket, the ball sat up to be hit there. {{BATSMAN}} just decided to go across the line, the ball may have spun, and the {{BATSMAN}} ended up slicing the slog to towards wide long-off, where Faulkner's present. \"Oh he'll drop it\". \"Gujarat are having a bad day, so this should go down\". But it doesn't. Faulkner slides in front and takes a good catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Faulkner b {{BOWLER}} 61(31) [6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! The time-out has struck. That was a flighted ball, the batsman skews the sweep back and the bowler does the rest. Caught and bowled is trending. The googly dipped, spun a little and the lack of pace from the wicket also helped. Huge strike for KKR. They are back in this. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 46(41) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! He is punching the air as if he was a boxer beating the hell out of your defeated opponent. What bowling from {{BOWLER}}. He is turning it on for RCB. That's as comprehensive as it gets. Sets {{BATSMAN}} up for the cut but the ball fizzes off the pitch and beats the shot to clatter the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} is not a bad player of spin, just the quality of {{BOWLER}} outshining and outsmarting the spinner. Now RCB are well on top. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gowtham!! What just happened there? A relay catch! Kohli looks bemused. The length ball and the batsman slogged it away to send it skywards. Samson came charging in and dropped it, but the ball popped up. But Gowtham, who almost collided with his mate kept his wits and took it low and one-handed. Tremendous reflexes after the ball ricocheted off Samson's palm. {{BATSMAN}} c Gowtham b {{BOWLER}} 14(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Samson Run Out!! Poor running. Absolutely poor. {{BATSMAN}} steers it to the left of backward point. The ball goes at a good bounce for Stokes to pick it up and hit the stumps direct. Sanju Samson was nowhere in the frame and Ananthapadmanabhan has his finger up. Sanju Samson walks back disappointed and an end of a good first over. Samson run out (Stokes) 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Watson Run Out!! Shane Watson was moving slowly as he went for that run, wonder if he was carrying a niggle there. {{BATSMAN}} pushed this flatter delivery towards extra-cover and set off, Watson was slow to take off, captain Kane threw it to the keeper, who did the rest. Finally a breakthrough for SRH, but Watson has done his job. Watson run out (Williamson/Goswami) 57(35) [4s-5 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bumrah!! Strange shot from {{BATSMAN}}, almost waving this short ball down to third man. Probably he got a bit too cramped for room, so he couldn't go through with this upper cut. Nothing shot in the end, just gliding it down the fielder's throat. Bravo has started well at the other end, but he's now in danger of running out of partners. {{BATSMAN}} c Bumrah b {{BOWLER}} 8(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! A fine knock ends. He provided the much needed impetus to the innings. Deserved a fifty, but that's cricket. Short delivery that caught {{BATSMAN}} by a bit of surprise, pulled it towards long-on and Suryakumar takes the easiest of catches. Raina pats him on the back as he trudges off. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 47(25) [4s-6 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out K Paul Run Out!! Well it can get worse. {{BOWLER}} - if his yorker doesn't get you, his direct hit will. {{BATSMAN}} just dug it out down the pitch but Paul nevertheless was half way down the pitch. {{BOWLER}} fielded, lined up, aimed, waited, aimed better and nailed the throw at the non-striker's. It helps when Paul gives up and stands to watch it as well. K Paul run out ({{BOWLER}}) 0(0)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! {{BOWLER}} runs his fingers across for some magic. Helped by {{BATSMAN}}, who came down the track and backed away early, allowing {{BOWLER}} to take pace off the ball. Checked the flat-batted smack that he intended to clear cow corner with, toe-ended it to mid-on, where Shardul made a somewhat easy catch look difficult. Probably the wind. Stuttered on the first attempt but managed to hold onto it. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 5(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! What a game young Yashaswi Jaiswal is having. He may not have starred with the bat yet, but he's done enough in this game already to make his presence felt in the side. Shane Warne is happy in the stands. {{BATSMAN}} pushed this towards extra cover and wanted a quick single, Pant was hesitant and sent him back after a momentary sprint. The {{TEAM}} skipper though was too far down the pitch and Jaiswal hit the stumps direct with a rifle-like throw. Brilliant work from the teenager. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Jaiswal) 22(18) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} is off. Game on! The wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} certainly did not pick it as he went back to play the cut shot, the ball spun back in and got the under edge, deflected onto the stumps. {{BOWLER}} is off on his sprint. Almost ends up near deep square leg. Two wickets in succession and the game is back in balance. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! This is a brilliant one-handed return catch from {{BOWLER}}, who is absolutely fired up. He rushed {{BATSMAN}} with the short ball, and then rushed forward in his followthrough before diving and taking it with his right hand. It was flapped up off the splice by {{BATSMAN}}, after getting severely cramped. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 10(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nabi!! Length delivery going across and was a slower delivery, {{BATSMAN}} tried to take the skin off the ball and miscued it for the man at long-off to take it. This is one frustrating aspect of his batting. Looks to finish it with a glory shot and perishes. Three wickets remain. Can SRH script something miraculous? I feel its too late. {{BATSMAN}} c Nabi b {{BOWLER}} 49(21) [4s-2 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! Juggling take by Virat Kohli. RCB have three, {{BOWLER}} has two. Pinned this full ball at the base of off-stump asking the youngster to go aerial if he can, {{BATSMAN}} obliges and seeks to loft it over the infield but doesn't get any timing on that. Skews it off the cue end and it loops up over mid-off where Kohli gathers the rebound with his left hand after having juggled it twice on the first attempt. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 9(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Absolute ripper from {{BOWLER}}! {{BOWLER}} had been getting it to turn since ball one and with {{BATSMAN}} not being great against spin, this was on the cards. He was premeditating the charge down the track and {{BOWLER}} smartly held the length back. Kept it straighter too on middle and leg, spun sharply past the outside edge to make a mess of the stumps. The left arm spinner might well be the difference between the two sides. {{BATSMAN}} was looking threatening but has been removed at the right time as far as RCB are concerned. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 43(31) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! That's a horrible shot by the {{TEAM}} skipper! Swings hard at a short of a length delivery and miscues it completely. It's Suryakumar at backward point who takes the dolly, he ain't gonna drop those folks! Wicket on the first ball for {{BOWLER}}, he got three against the same side at Wankhede a few weeks back. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! {{BOWLER}} comes back in the attack and strikes. How often do we see that? Got de Villiers earlier, gets another big wicket now. A length delivery around off and {{BATSMAN}} holes out to long-on as he looks to clear the fence this time around. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 41(33) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! Gone this time. Thakur juggles once and takes it on the second attempt. Short and got big on DK outside off, he still tries to force the upper cut and hits it flat and straight to the fielder at square third man. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 12(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned up! {{BOWLER}} adds {{BATSMAN}} to his prodigious list. The googly and {{BATSMAN}} did not pick it, he stayed rooted to the crease and tried to read it off the surface, too late. The ball spun back in hit the front pad before ricocheting onto the stumps. A much needed wicket after a sloppy start. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 13(14) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bumrah!! A soft dismissal, this came from nowhere but MI will gladly take it. The short ball has got them a wicket, {{BATSMAN}} is gutted as he walks away. Banged in short and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} had all the time in the world as he pulled, just didn't pick the gap, hits it straight into the hands of Bumrah at short fine. Relief for {{BOWLER}} and MI. There's the customary check for the front-foot no-ball, but {{BOWLER}} is fine on that count as well. {{BATSMAN}} c Bumrah b {{BOWLER}} 17(13) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Siraj!! How often have you seen {{BATSMAN}} get out, mistiming a pull? His staple shot is the pull. Made a career out of it as a batsman even fetching length balls and muscling them over mid-wicket. But {{BOWLER}} has him again. Credit to Kohli for throwing the ball to the left-arm spinner, he has a good record against {{BATSMAN}} and gets him with a short ball. May have skidded on a wee bit to catch {{BATSMAN}}'s inner half, Siraj takes a dolly at mid-on and flings the ball away. {{BOWLER}} raises his arms in triumph. {{BATSMAN}} c Siraj b {{BOWLER}} 7(4) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! This is not what you expect from an experienced campaigner. With Pant going brilliantly, {{BATSMAN}} just needed to give the strike to the youngster. Instead he advances and fails to pick the offie, the ball breaks back in and hits the top of leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shami!! There's the salute as {{BOWLER}} gets a wicket off his final ball. Went for the short delivery and it worked for him. {{BATSMAN}} hopped back, opened his bat face and flayed it up in the air to third man. Couldn't find the distance and Shami pouches it comfortably. {{BATSMAN}} had the licence to go for the kill, but eish.. {{BATSMAN}} c Shami b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! The decision to play {{BOWLER}} is proving to be a masterstroke for Mumbai Indians so far. It was a back of a length delivery and was wide of off, it skids off the deck. {{BATSMAN}} was a week late on the pull shot. It comes off the upper half of the blade and pops up in the air. Hardik Pandya at backward point won't do a Pollard. He takes a sitter of sitter. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 5(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} wants to review, but Punjab don't have any left. A double-wicket maiden from {{BOWLER}}! The googly does the trick, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't pick it and ends up playing way outside the line of it. Gets rapped on the pads adjacent to the sticks. Only height could have saved him, but he was playing off the back foot. Umpire's call on HawkEye. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Excellent cricket from the {{TEAM}} captain and MI have lost their third wicket. Coming to the ball, it was full and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} came down the track, made room and drove it towards mid-off. There was a single there - at least {{BATSMAN}} thought as he called for a quick single. Smith moved across to his left, turned around and broke the stumps at the bowler's end - all in one motion. {{BATSMAN}} was scrambling across, but falls well short. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Smith) 12(15) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Billings!! Would you believe that? {{BATSMAN}} perishes to a full toss. There was one fielder in the deep on the leg-side and {{BATSMAN}} finds him perfectly. A low full toss on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} with a slight shuffle, flicks it in the air and hits it straight down the throat of Billings at long leg. Punjab in a spot of bother. {{BATSMAN}} c Billings b {{BOWLER}} 19(12) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BATSMAN}} {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Livingstone!! Perks of having a leggie in your team. {{BATSMAN}} gets the prized scalp of {{BATSMAN}}, who can't believe his luck that he's holed out to the fielder. {{BATSMAN}} continues to grow from strength to strength and provides his team a crucial breakthrough. Throws it up luringly, {{BATSMAN}} takes his front leg out of the way and launches it down the ground. The timing goes haywire and picks out Livingstone at long-on, who didn't have to move an inch. {{BATSMAN}} c Livingstone b {{BATSMAN}} {{BOWLER}} 15(9) [6s-2]\n",
            "Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Bangalore are falling apart here. Colin {{BATSMAN}} always finds it difficult to bat against spin early in the innings and the difficulty goes up in these sorts of pitches. Ravindra Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja gave a bit of flight on this occasion and CdG was half-forward for a tentative push. Gets a faint outsi{{BATSMAN}} edge and Dhoni makes no mistakes. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja 4(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! All the muscle. But all the placement. Too bad it had to come off a full toss too. Yea, blame the timing, for {{BATSMAN}} couldn't have picked out extra cover any better. He drives, doesn't bother keeping it down and who better than Raina to take these tracer bullets. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 23(15) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} has been given out lbw, he has a chat with QdK and reviews. Did it pitch in-line? That could be the only factor saving {{BATSMAN}} here because there's no bat, HawkEye confirms it. Pitching - In-line. Impact - In-line. Wickets - Umpire's call. It's crashing the top of leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}}'s a goner. Huge strike for CSK. Glum faces in the {{TEAM}} camp. It's a similar delivery that trapped Chris Lynn. The outswinger again, pitched on a length and straightened viciously leaving {{BATSMAN}} all at sea as he plays down the wrong line. Gets beaten on the outside edge and it clicks him on the back pad. Umpire Nitin Menon was quick to raise his finger and he's spot on. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 4(2) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Murugan Ashwin!! {{BATSMAN}} absolutely smashes this pull shot, but it goes straight to Murugan Ashwin who was standing at least 15-20 yards inside the boundary. That positioning was probably to stop the second run, which this pair has so frequently charged for to exploit the long boundary. But it works brilliantly in a separate context here. Short ball, hammered off the front foot well in front of square, it goes flat and hard - straight to deep midwicket. Ashwin comes charging across in celebration. There might yet be some more chapters to write before this game is done. {{BATSMAN}} c Murugan Ashwin b {{BOWLER}} 67(53) [4s-8]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shivam Mavi!! Easy for backward point. Back of the hand slower delivery, {{BOWLER}} bowls that well. He is so confident with that delivery that he regularly and surprisingly bowled it in the Ashes Test. To not great effect it must be said. But here he gets {{BATSMAN}} slicing it off a thick outside edge and grabs a wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Shivam Mavi b {{BOWLER}} 12(7) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Maxwell!! A wicket for Kings XI after almost 35 overs. Remember the Pollard-Pandya carnage, then Watson-Faf chase and now this. It is the young leggie who has broken this partnership. {{BATSMAN}} had to go as Bairstow was playing for those three runs to get to his hundred. He takes on the googly and skies the slog sweep straight up, Maxwell settles under near long-on and pouches it comfortably. {{BATSMAN}} c Maxwell b {{BOWLER}} 52(40) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Gopal!! {{BOWLER}} wins the battle straightaway! Massive strike, considering {{BATSMAN}}'s recent hitting form. He never got going today though, seemed scratchy and even disinterested a bit. Had to launch now with enough batting in the shed and opts for the muscular slog of his. The length isn't there and the result is a miscue that goes miles in the air. Brilliant catch from Gopal who steadied himself nicely at mid-wicket to take it with a tumble. Never easy these catches, especially if they are of a dangerous batsman, the pressure just adds up. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Gopal b {{BOWLER}} 6(12)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Another one bites the dust. Against the run of play, Punjab lose another one. It was a short ball slanted at the body, {{BATSMAN}} went after it, gets it high on the bat and skews it to long-on where Suryakumar Yadav pouches it safely. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 10(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Loud shout for LBW. And Rajasthan go upstairs with the review. Drifted across from over the wicket and it spun into the left-hander, surprising him with the turn. Pitching just outside off-stump -- slowmo replays suggest -- and rapping the front leg near the knee-roll. Impact on middle and that's crashing into the top of leg-stump, says ball-tracking. So {{BATSMAN}} will have to go, as RR hold on to their review. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 21(17) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Plunkett!! Add another to his repertoire. When he doesn't have the ball in hand, the ball will follow him in the field. A full floater from {{BOWLER}}, inviting an away from the body drive. Sliced uppishly, flat and Plunkett at deep sweeper dives forward. The catches can be taken again. {{BATSMAN}} c Plunkett b {{BOWLER}} 26(19) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Riyan Parag!! {{BOWLER}} gets {{BATSMAN}}. A floated delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} looks to take on {{BOWLER}} and fails in his quest to clear long-off. Lofts it high up in the air, but fails to get the distance. It's Riyan Parag who completes a safe catch in the deep. This has been the problem with {{BATSMAN}} this season. He's getting those starts, but he's not really able to convert them. {{BATSMAN}} c Riyan Parag b {{BOWLER}} 22(17) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! {{BATSMAN}} departs soon after reaching his fifty. Maybe a lapse in concentration there. This was darted outside off and as {{BATSMAN}} tried to run it down to third man he got a thick outside edge. Rahul behind the wickets takes a sharp catch as Royals lose their fifth wicket. {{BOWLER}} gets his second wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 51(39) [4s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! {{BOWLER}} is turning it on for MI. \"You cannot keep {{BOWLER}} out of the game,\" chirps Kevin Pietersen on air. It was the slower ball, lands it well outside off making {{BATSMAN}} to fetch for it. The batsman accepts the challenge and reaches out aiming for a biggie. Terribly mistimes, slicing it up off a top-edge. QdK back-tracks, calls for it and nestles in his gloves. Huge blow for {{TEAM}} this. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 41(29) [4s-2 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! The crowd are stunned. A hush of silence and disappointment descends on the Chinnaswamy. Their favorite son of the non-soil is gone. Ok - I made that up. Back to the wicket. This was another cutter on a short of length, trouble was {{BATSMAN}} looking to power it over long-on off the front foot. Such a difficult shot that one - even if you are {{BATSMAN}}. He holes out to long-on. Polly won't drop that. {{BATSMAN}} is shocked to say the least, makes his emotions known before trudging off. That's a difference of at least 20 in my book. Now {{BOWLER}} suddenly is on a hat-trick. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 32(26) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! Thakur doesn't drop it this time. A simple catch, and he will be a relieved man. A short of a length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} loading his back foot decided to hoick over cow corner. Gets it off the bottom part of the bat and the ball settles into the hands of the long-on fielder. Thakur moved to his right and reverse-cvupped it. Way too many high risk shots from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 17(17) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! Kotla heartbreak. A quicker bumper, {{BATSMAN}} can't resist, but for once doesn't find his bat's middle. Big fat top-edge, ballooning high, where DK calls, and nearly makes a mess under the skier, eventually having to take his tummy's help in holding on. So {{BATSMAN}} may have missed out on becoming the youngest IPL centurion, but he becomes the second in these 12 seasons to get out on 99. It's all about getting into trivia books after all, right?! {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 99(55) [4s-12 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has done it. That is surely the game for the RCB. {{BATSMAN}} moves across towards off, {{BOWLER}} may or may not have seen that but he fires it on leg-stump and uproots it. A real valiant effort from {{BATSMAN}} comes to an end. He's dragging himself off. Got to feel for him. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 57(36) [4s-3 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! That was full and straight from round the wicket and the batsman misses it to be out LBW. That was going down is what I feel. But the ball tailed in a touch and the batsman was falling over a bit to give the impression to the umpire that the ball struck the batter adjacent to the wickets. A lucky one for KKR there. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 6(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bairstow!! {{BOWLER}} gets a wicket in his first over of the season. Short of a length delivery just outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} tries to punch off the back foot, the ball bounces, hits him high on the bat and the edge goes straight to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 4(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Walks right past the googly, didn't have a clue about it! Fuller length from {{BOWLER}}, pitched around middle and {{BATSMAN}} was looking to work it through the on-side, expecting a leg-break. But he's wrong. He's also reaching for the ball, as it has pitched well short of him, and so the balance - the lack of it - takes him out of the crease. Excellent stumping from Bairstow. {{BATSMAN}} st Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 38(24) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar {{BOWLER}}!! Second wicket for {{BOWLER}}. One shot too many from {{BATSMAN}}. It was the wrong 'un which was on a fuller length, {{BATSMAN}} gives himself room to go inside out, the bat turns on impact and the ball skews towards long-off. Suryakumar runs around the circumference and pouches it cleanly. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 15(8) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Livingstone!! {{BATSMAN}} perishes. Fast, fiery and full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was beaten for the pace as he loses his shape attempting an across-the-line mow. Slices it off the outer half and it balloons towards sweeper cover where Livingstone grabs it with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Livingstone b {{BOWLER}} 6(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Much-nee{{BATSMAN}}d breakthrough for KXIP. {{BATSMAN}} was getting into overdrive and this shot perhaps, was a result of that. Premeditated by walking across the stumps and {{BOWLER}} did the basics right, full and straight. {{BATSMAN}} couldn't connect the sweep and once he got hit on the pad, it was always going to be out. The umpire felt so too and although the South African opted for the DRS, there was nothing on UltraEdge to save him. Three Reds on HawkEye to compound the misery and {{TEAM}} have lost the review. Excellent innings nevertheless. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 60(39) [4s-6 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shankar!! The case of {{BOWLER}} winning the battle, it's not the first time and the arms go wide in celebration. {{BATSMAN}} is stunned but has to go. This could dent {{TEAM}}'s prospects of posting a par total. Tosses it outside off and forces the batsman to fetch for it. {{BATSMAN}} goes on one-knee and clouts it across the line, airy and Vijay Shankar, manning the deep mid-wicket fence moves across and takes a smart catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 14(14) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! The flattish ball spun in sharply and hit the batsman high on the back leg. Looks a little high. Was there an inside edge? NO! The height is not an issue. Three Reds. {{TEAM}} are going down like a lead balloon. The ball skidded on and the batsman was late on the attempted swat on the on-side. This is tragedy for {{TEAM}}. From 59 in 4 overs to this. T20 cricket and its speed taking a toll on {{TEAM}}. In dire straits. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 12(10) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! {{BATSMAN}} holes out. To deep mid-wicket. Went down on one knee and tried to slog-sweep that but no connection whatsoever on that hit, easy catch for the fielder. He was going hard on everything and his misery ends. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 17(13) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Cutting has conjured a wicket out of nowhere. That's a sensational throw from the deep. My goodness. He's absolutely nailed the stump from long leg and {{BATSMAN}} is out of here. This is a huge moment in the context of the match, especially as {{BATSMAN}} was looking so good. Even this shot which he played was extraordinary. It was a length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} sat on his back knee and scooped it over short fine leg. He was a little slow to decide on the second run, maybe a little hesitant and boy did Cutting make him pay! More than a couple of feet short, even with a dive. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Cutting) 31(16) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has his man. Big moment in the game. That might be the match. Even {{BOWLER}} enjoyed out. He lets out a roar. Never seen him express his delight after picking a wicket. The round the wicket ploy has worked, carrom ball on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} kneels to play the slog sweep, gets an inside edge onto the front thigh, the backspin on the ball takes it onto the stumps. Unfortunate way to get out. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 66(29) [4s-2 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! 101st dismissal for MS and he took it as cool as a cucumber. He's still one of the best keepers in the game - and this catch shows why. This was another slower short ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} made room outside leg and was looking to flay it through mid-wicket, played the shot a tad too early, got a fat top-edge. For a moment he seemed to be safe, but there was that man. MS ran backwards, kept his eyes on the ball, timed his leap well and completed a one-handed catch - with his right glove. {{BOWLER}} clenches his fists in delight - as much as a keeper's wicket as it was for the bowler there. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 27(21) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! The slower delivery does the trick. Tucked the batsman up with an off-cutter, which bounced on the batter, who got a leading edge and was taken by the man at cover. tried to close the face of the bat a bit but was undone by the clever change of pace. Top-clas from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 2 runs completed. {{TEAM}} sink further! Not their day, perhaps. All credit to Rabada though, he dived full stretch to his left after he sprinted across from sweeper cover. {{BATSMAN}} had square driven it through point and was expecting a boundary but is denied that due to some brilliance it the field. KG had parried the ball to Patel in the deep and the throw came in at the bowler's end. The batsman was ball watching while going for the third run and has to pay the price for it. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Harshal Patel/{{BOWLER}}) 4(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} has chopped on for the second straight time in this tournament. On a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} saw the width, manufactured a bit more by backing away slightly, went with hard hands on the cut, gets an inside edge that bounces back onto the middle-stump. He was looking very good, but it means nothing now. Another promising start, but nothing more for {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 12(10) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Holes out at long-on. Advanced down for a big shot, not quite getting to the pitch of the leg-break, so it came right off the toe-end from {{BATSMAN}}. With the hardness of the ball fading, and with both openers dismissed, it's getting difficult for Delhi now. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 20(24) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Lewis! On a back of a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets low and tries carving it away through backward point, but fails to find the gap, picks out Lewis at backward point and that's the end of the road for {{BATSMAN}} tonight. An excellent catch by Lewis, diving to his right, and a bit of a send-off by {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Lewis b {{BOWLER}} 25(15) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Malinga!! Talk of dreamy bowling figures. 3 wickets, 2 runs. This is a T20 mind you. And a qualifier too. {{BOWLER}} helps himself to a few free ones. Bangs it in short, {{BATSMAN}} wants to pull it into the river. The sluggish pitch makes him wait and then spits the ball up too. Just the top edge but Malinga swirls all under it at long leg, almost messes it up and then dives to bring about a massive smile on his face. {{BATSMAN}} c Malinga b {{BOWLER}} 31(25) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The googly and it takes out the leg stump. {{BATSMAN}} on one knee to slog-sweep it for six, but missed the ball completely and lost the pole. A fine fifty from {{BATSMAN}}, but {{TEAM}} needed him to push a little more hard chasing 219. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 58(34) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! {{BATSMAN}} departs! Never got going today and with the required rate soaring, he had to take a risk. Tries but doesn't work. Stepped out in a premeditated manner and {{BOWLER}} smartly dug it short, at the body, cramping MS completely. The result is a forced pull and it's aerial too. Dolly for Surya at square leg. Massive dent to {{TEAM}}'s already fading chances in the game. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 12(21)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} has the early wicket. That was dead in front. One of the easiest decisions Erasmus would have made. {{BATSMAN}} has missed out on a full toss, he closes the bat face tad too early on the flick, beaten on the inside edge and the ball crashed into the back pad. It would have crashed into middle stump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 6(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal {{BOWLER}}!! The {{BOWLER}} brothers in action and {{TEAM}} have lost both openers now. This is a horrendous shot from young {{BATSMAN}} though, the slower off-cutter from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to hoist it out of the stadium, the bat turned on impact as the ball gripped on the surface, the steepling toe-end went high and towards mid-off. The elder {{BOWLER}} was under the ball, completes it with great composure and all of a sudden - {{TEAM}} have lost two. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 7(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Vijay Shankar!! First ball wicket after the break. {{BOWLER}} strikes gold. But wouldn't have been possible without Vijay Shankar - who has pulled off a blinder at long-on. Compensates for his earlier blip where he dropped Lewis at cover. Flighted teasingly from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} took the bait -- had to because he was struggling a bit. Meets the pitch in a hurry and smashed it flat towards long-on. Vijay Shankar at the edge of the ropes, judges it well and clings onto it above his head. Made sure, he didn't topple over the ropes despite one leg balancing in the air. {{BATSMAN}} c Vijay Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 5(13)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! Slices it up a mile in the air, really cool pressure catch from Thakur at long-off. Big wicket for CSK, straight after the time-out. Good length ball wide of off, gets it out of the batsman's swinging arc. {{BATSMAN}} flings his hands at it, slicing it up right off the bottom. Excellent bowling. {{BOWLER}} coming to the fore again. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 47(43) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! And just like that he is gone. Look at {{BATSMAN}}'s expression. One of disbelief. Which we have seen quite often this season. That feeling of how have I done this. A harmless cutter down leg, {{BATSMAN}} has just chipped it head-high to mid-wicket to his opposite number. A dolly and Rohit can't hide his smile. {{BOWLER}} is busy fist pumping his way to glory. That's as soft as it gets. And it has happened repetitively for {{BATSMAN}}'s liking this season. When it is not going for you, these things can happen. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 20(14) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Badree!! Oh no! {{BATSMAN}} has been caught but the umpire is checking for a no-ball. It is touch and go. GO it is for {{BATSMAN}}. Looked really close and the benefit of doubt has gone to the bowler on this occasion. Nicely tossed up delivery and {{BATSMAN}} brings out the switch-hit. The top edge skies towards short third man, it was a tough one and the experienced Samuel Badree pouches it and puffs his cheeks. He knew it was a steepler and needed to his eyes on the ball till the last second. {{BATSMAN}} c Badree b {{BOWLER}} 6(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Smith!! Kohli looks upset as another wicket falls down! {{BATSMAN}}'s comeback is brief and short. This was pushed through flatter and on his pads, {{BATSMAN}} went back on the punch, hit it firmly but in the air - just about carried to mid-wicket where Smith slid forward and held on. He wasn't sure that it carried, but the soft call was OUT and it stayed with the original call. {{BATSMAN}} c Smith b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! It was all timing till it lasted. The moment it deserts him, he falls. It was {{BOWLER}}'s famed slower gripper, {{BATSMAN}} tries hoicking it into cow corner. Gropes only the toe-end, spoons high and Hardik runs in. Nah, he ain't messing these up. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 52(39) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! One bobble, second pouch. Kumar - bringing all his experience into this - keeps it slow, outside off and forces {{BATSMAN}} to reach out and slice it to the longest part of the boundary at long-off. Doesn't matter, he'd miscued it alright as Pandey runs in from the boundary, and holds on with some help from his chest. So SRH finally are into their home territory of small defences, choking out teams at the death. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 21(12) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! Flat leg-break turning away from off, {{BATSMAN}} looks to whip it through the on-side but only manages an inside-edge which is taken smartly by Saha. He did have a word with Rahane about the review, may not have been entirely sure, but was happy to keep walking after getting little encouragement. Definite edge. Respite for the Sunrisers. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 44(26) [4s-4 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! The pressure gets to {{BATSMAN}} and he holes out to long-on. Advances and tries to dispatch {{BOWLER}} Patel over long-on, but the connection ain't sweet and he could only skew up a bottom edge to Shaw at long-on. Half the side back in the hut at the half-way stage. {{BATSMAN}} c Prithvi Shaw b {{BOWLER}} 12(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! {{BOWLER}} gets the better of him this time. He shortens the length far enough to give room for the googly to turn past the outside edge. {{BATSMAN}}, who's running down the pitch again, doesn't back out despite not reaching to the pitch. He slogs in vain. And because he is so far down, there's no going back either despite a valiant effort to do so. Neat stumping from {{BATSMAN}}son. {{BATSMAN}} st {{BATSMAN}}son b {{BOWLER}} 17(6) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Lomror!! The procession continues. {{BOWLER}} joins the party as he removes Mann. Also, breaks into a jig. {{TEAM}} have lost the plot completely. Drifted quicker on middle and leg, Mann heaves it across the line and miscues it totally. Only succeeds in finding the fielder at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Lomror b {{BOWLER}} 6(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Looks like {{BATSMAN}} has only one shot in his arsenal. The cut. Very risky against a promising {{BOWLER}}. The leg-spinner fizzes off the deck and beats the late-cut, knocks the off-stump back. Not a very wise shot when he should be looking to give the strike to Pathan. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Agarwal!! {{BOWLER}} strikes! KXIP needed a wicket and the skipper delivers. He pumps his fist in delight. Carrom ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room to go over extra cover, but hit it straighter than he would have liked, Mayank didn't have to move much and took it with his fingers pointing upwards near long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Agarwal b {{BOWLER}} 22(14) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Gives it plenty of air and catches {{BATSMAN}} on the move. No balance from pocket rocket, swings wildly and the bottom hand comes off while doing so, his back foot got dragged too far in the process and Dhoni ain't missing that stumping chance. {{BATSMAN}} st Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 57(45) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Head!! {{BOWLER}}'s got his man. He almost had {{BATSMAN}} when he managed to hit that mistimed boundary, but this time the batsman has found the fielder. They check for the no-ball, but {{BOWLER}} just escapes. By a centimetre or so. This is certainly not an easy wicket to bat on against the slower bowlers. It's stopping on the batsman or gripping the surface when the length isn't too full. {{BATSMAN}} stepped out and flicked, no timing and straight to deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Head b {{BOWLER}} 17(13) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Howrah bridge is falling down. Without repair. After the softening blow, {{BOWLER}} goes for his ideal sucker delivery. Full, slowed up and {{BATSMAN}} once again looks to use the pace with his lofted slog. Nope, none of it coming this time. Flies off the cue-end down the throat of deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 6(4) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! Slammed on the up and it finds the man at mid-off. That was a back of a length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} tried to flat-bat it but ended up finding ABD at mid-off. Soft dismissal. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mandeep!! \"Mumbai Indians are committing hara-kiri\" screams Ravi Shaz on air. Can't disagree. {{BATSMAN}} has been promoted up the order and what does he do first ball? Gets underneath a full toss and smacks it straight into the bucket hands of Mandeep at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Mandeep b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! Hooda under the skier again, and he takes it this time. Makes amends. But massive props to {{BOWLER}}, stepping up to answer his captain's call once more. He's done it time and again this season. Uses the knuckle ball to deceive {{BATSMAN}} who is early into the heave. The ball is launched into the night sky, Hooda comes in from deep mid-wicket, settles under it and overcomes a slight bobble to grab hold of it. That should seal it. {{BATSMAN}} c Deepak Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 84(50) [4s-14 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Through him. A big hoick across the line, and not that he had much of a choice here did Patel, but clearly wasn't even close to the line, that manages to drift in through the air and come in with the angle to drag off the inside edge to leave an LED-lit mess behind. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Nope. He's gone. Maiden IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}}. He sends back his fellow countryman. The slower delivery which is fuller than the previous one, {{BATSMAN}} targets cow corner this time, but he was hitting against the wind and to the longest part of the ground, only succeeded in getting it to Gill at the edge of the rope. {{BATSMAN}} c Shubman Gill b {{BOWLER}} 37(34) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Waste, a complete waste. {{BATSMAN}} has had a brainfade. He's completely caught up in the LBW call, so much so that he forgets to plonk his bat inside the crease. Excellent comeback from {{BOWLER}}, spearing it full on leg, {{BATSMAN}} plays across the line and it appears to hit him on the back leg. Maybe an inside edge, maybe going down leg, whatever it is, it isn't out. Meanwhile, {{BATSMAN}} is anxious about the decision, wanders out of the crease and Raina capitalizes from slip. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Raina) 4(2) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hetmyer!! Another pull, another miscue. Hurries {{BATSMAN}} into this one, and he tries some sort of a tennis forehand in the end, which ends up getting spooned tamely to deep mid-wicket this time. Hyderabad are falling apart, quite badly too. {{BATSMAN}} c Hetmyer b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bairstow!! And he nicks off immediately. Full and wide outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} tries to square-drive, but gets a thick edge and he doesn't wait for the umpire. {{BOWLER}} gets his first IPL wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 40(24) [4s-4 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hooda!! Another greedy dismissal. Knuckle ball bowled a shade outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't pick the variation and lofts it high into the night sky, Hooda had a week's time before catching that around his throat at long-on. Easy! {{BATSMAN}} c Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out S Kaul Run Out!! 1 run completed. Confusion and Kaul is gone. Swiped to deep mid, again Kohli is quick and a bit of an yes-no situation, accurate throw on the bounce to Parthiv Patel who whips the bails off, leaving Kaul out. He needed to dive but didn't. RCB finishing strongly. S Kaul run out (Kohli/Parthiv Patel) 1(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rabada!! Weird shot from {{BATSMAN}}!! He had just come in and this isn't the easiest of surfaces to start on. Looks to take {{BOWLER}} on with the slog sweep but is done in flight and gets a top-edge that's pouched comfortably at deep mid-wicket. It's that longer part of the ground which undid MI yesterday in Dubai, and just like that here in Abu Dhabi, has taken out {{BATSMAN}} today. He was clutching his hamstring last over, so did that play a role in this shot? Either ways, DC aren't complaining. This is a fab phase for them. {{BATSMAN}} c Rabada b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Billings!! Someone please stop {{BOWLER}}. Or he will run all the way from the Stadium to Chennai. Thankfully a CSK teammate does stop him. He has gone mental. But {{BATSMAN}}served wicket for him and credit to MS too for giving the field to him. Wanted {{BOWLER}} to toss it up outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, out of {{BATSMAN}}'s reach. Must have expected {{BATSMAN}} to go for it after just four came off the last ten balls. And it works. {{BATSMAN}} wants to go in-to-out, but the spin away forces the miscue, and they have one of the best fiel{{BATSMAN}}rs in the team in Billings at {{BATSMAN}}ep cover, running in to settle un{{BATSMAN}}r that. Pressure catch but he hangs on and sends the CSK section into pangs of uncontrolled emotion. {{BATSMAN}} c Billings b {{BOWLER}} 68(30) [4s-2 6s-8]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson! Charges, and tries to swing this over the on-side, but gets it close to the shoulder of the outside edge and almost over the 'keeper, but Samson can do no wrong today! Leaps to take that one, and it sticks! Maginificent catch to get rid of {{BATSMAN}}! {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 22(16) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Another twist. Agatha Christie would be so damn proud. {{BOWLER}} lets out the bouncer, neatly directed into the head, and {{BATSMAN}}'s pulls in desperation, top-edging it high. {{BOWLER}} takes matters into his own hands. Calls and holds his nerve. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 8(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! The fun's over. A length delivery, in the slot you'd think at this stage of the game and with pace. But {{BATSMAN}} goes a little too hard on his bat-swing, inside-halving the miscued balloon to deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 33(12) [4s-1 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stoinis!! Another one bites the dust. Was a short delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} went for a pull but the pace was too good for him and the batsman ended up splicing it to short mid-wicket. Can't get any easier for Stoinis who grabs it with both hands. This is why {{BOWLER}} was brought back into the attack and he gets a wicket, doesn't disappoint his skipper. {{BATSMAN}} c Stoinis b {{BOWLER}} 5(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Excellent cricket from the RPS captain and {{TEAM}} have lost their third wicket. Coming to the ball, it was full and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} came down the track, made room and drove it towards mid-off. There was a single there - at least {{BATSMAN}} thought as he called for a quick single. Smith moved across to his left, turned around and broke the stumps at the bowler's end - all in one motion. {{BATSMAN}} was scrambling across, but falls well short. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Smith) 12(15) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Billings!! {{BATSMAN}}'s head dropped as soon as this left his bat. Knew he hadn't got it off the middle. Flighted leg-break from {{BOWLER}}, it comes off a thick top-edge as {{BATSMAN}} looks to slog-sweep and it's calmly taken at the mid-wicket boundary. {{BATSMAN}} c Billings b {{BOWLER}} 45(37) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! MS files to his right and takes a superb catch. What a spectacular over by {{BOWLER}} as he concedes only four runs. Slightly short ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swings across the line and gets an outside edge which has been taken. A rather rusty knock comes to an end. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 26(22) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! RCB review: {{BATSMAN}} pulled and seemed to have missed it IMO, but the opinion that matters is that of the TV umpire. So, let's wait and go through the process. Legal delivery. QDK wasn't excited after grabbing the ball. Virat Kohli and a couple of ring fielders got excited and the RCB skipper wasted no time in posing a T-sign to the onfield umpire, and he is absolutely right in doing so. A spike on the UltraEdge and {{BATSMAN}} is gone. A very faint one that and hard to spot amidst the fuzzy environment. The decision has been reversed. OUT. This is a classic case of both batsman and bowler refusing to alter their plans. {{BOWLER}} dished out a short ball and made life difficult for {{BATSMAN}} by cutting it across him, the angle was always going against him. He ran down the pitch and fed a faint nick on the pull. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 6(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishant!! In the air and taken. What are {{TEAM}} doing here? This is the most ordinary batting performance we have seen by any side in this year's IPL. It was a flighted delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} charges down, wanted to loft it over long-off. He failed to time it as well as he would have liked and ends up gifting a catch to long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishant b {{BOWLER}} 6(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That's big, that's huge and that might have just won this match for SRH. The wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}} and MS didn't read it, he was lunging forward, was perhaps looking to push it too square, the ball grazed the inside edge, went through the huge gap between bat and pad and disturbed the stumps. {{BOWLER}} is thrilled to bits, so are the SRH camp. They are defending a modest target with elan once again. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 9(18) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! {{BATSMAN}}'s fun is over, but has he taken this match away from KXIP's grasp? This was banged in short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across and pulls it hard and flat - was struck pretty well but went straight into the hands of Axar at deep mid-wicket. He doesn't drop those and {{BATSMAN}} walks off to a nice round of applause. Even his captain enjoyed it, gives a good send-off to his partner. {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 37(18) [4s-4 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard! Tries getting under it, but doesn't do so well enough to a really full ball, and the result is that he can't quite get the desired height - and that would mean Pollard at long-on has to hold on to a ridiculously easy catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 24(11) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! Bhajji strikes again and brings out his fist pump to celebrate this wicket. {{BATSMAN}} plays one shot too many and has to pay the price for it. He had struck a six already and there was no need to go after the offie. Goes hard at it and gets a thick outside edge that flies to short third man. Watto completes the formalities inside the ring. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 10(12) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! What have you done mr. {{BATSMAN}}? Was that needed? Tries to go for a big slog sweep against a googly, gets a huge top-edge and Raina takes a dolly at cover. And {{BOWLER}} becomes the leading wicket-taker of the tourney. Is it a game changing moment? Might well be. CSK fans erupt. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 23(26) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Vijay Shankar!! Full at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} whips it away and it's gone straight to deep mid-wicket. {{BOWLER}} can do no wrong at the death these days. Despite missing the blockhole, he's still able to keep it full enough to ensure that {{BATSMAN}}'s wrists can't power it over the boundary. You don't want to get near {{BATSMAN}} right now. He slams his bat into the ground after crossing the boundary. There's smoke coming out there. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Vijay Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 10(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Klaasen!! Maiden IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}}. {{BOWLER}} will be chuffed to bits. {{BATSMAN}} loses shape as he winds up for a slog. {{BOWLER}} slips in a knuckle ball that holds up a touch on the pitch. {{BATSMAN}} went for the longer boundary - the deep mid-wicket area. Lacked timing and power, straight to Klaasen. Look at {{BOWLER}}, he breaks into a jig. {{BATSMAN}} c Klaasen b {{BOWLER}} 7(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} got rid of Kohli, he now gets rid of AB - this is simply sublime stuff from the Karnataka leg-spinner - and he's doing all the damage to his home based franchise. Another wrong 'un, think AB read as he went back, stayed a bit low and that meant the ball caught the leading edge on the flick. It was dying down on the bowler who does remarkably well to dive forward and grab it. After the fine start, {{TEAM}} have lost their two big guns. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 13(9) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bairstow!! An appeal for caught-behind, SRH decide against the review. Meanwhile, the umpires have sent it upstairs to check if it was a bump ball. The soft signal is Not Out. A yorker length ball from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} stays leg-side of the ball to jam it out. Don't think it is a bump ball. OUT signalled on the giant screen. And, the drama doesn't end there. {{BATSMAN}} starts to walk ... and then decides to challenge the call. The umpires had a chat and decided to call the third umpire, again! A review for caught-behind. There's a spike on Ultra Edge and it's clearly an outside edge as the bat hits the ground later. After all the drama, {{BATSMAN}} is out and he's wasted a review too. {{BATSMAN}} c Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sandeep Sharma!! This is astute planning from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} plays the sweep to the spinners. He knows this is a spinning surface, so pushed backward square leg back and kept fine leg in to invite {{BATSMAN}}, who fell in the trap top-edging a sweep to short fine leg. The length was full enough to play the shot, but it turned to take the edge. The line was also slightly outside off. {{BATSMAN}} c Sandeep Sharma b {{BOWLER}} 12(14) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! {{BOWLER}} has his man now! That's a big wicket for the Sunrisers, this was the knuckle ball and {{BATSMAN}} didn't pick it, he was done in by the change of pace as well, went through with the flick far too early, the ball lobbed off the splice of the bat and it's a simple low catch for Hooda - at short mid-wicket. The crowd finds its voice, no heroics from {{BATSMAN}} today. {{BATSMAN}} c Deepak Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 9(15) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Another one falls. An off-cutter from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} mistimes the slog off the inside half and holes out. Iyer, it seemed like, had lost it in the sun initially. But he picked it up in time and then sunk low for the grab. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! That's how you pluck a fruit from a tree. Nonchalance from Qdk. {{BATSMAN}}'s feathered an edge and has to walk back. Never looked comfortable at the crease to be honest. {{BOWLER}} just kept it short and took it away from him. The Southpaw went for the cross-batted pull and it didn't really come off for him, de Kock timed his jump to perfection and snatched it with one glove. {{BOWLER}} roars and {{TEAM}} have lost their second wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 9(10) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! 200th T20 wicket. He dropped him last over and now has removed the dangerous {{BATSMAN}}. Not much harm done. Look at {{BOWLER}} go. He's letting all his frustration out. Shouting and roaring at the top of his voice. Slows it up and drops it short, {{BATSMAN}} is early into the pull, the ball takes its time to beat the bat and hit the top of off-stump. Wicket off his final ball and {{BOWLER}} ends with: 4-0-20-1. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 17(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Maxwell!! Tag-team work and {{BATSMAN}} is gone. They are checking the height on this. But {{BOWLER}} is fine on that count. {{BATSMAN}} didn't get bat on the last delivery, this one he gets a thick edge on the slash and Pant tipped it over the bar, but great anticipation from Maxi at slip who tracked back and pouched it. Alert mind and good cricketing nous from the Australian. Deserved wicket for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Maxwell b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Kohli out, and {{BATSMAN}} follows him into the pavilion the next over. Bizarre way to get out actually. He's trying to reverse-paddle an off break from {{BOWLER}}. Stretches way in front to meet that, is beaten by a bit of turn down the leg-si{{BATSMAN}}, and then Dhoni is quick. Doesn't even allow {{BATSMAN}} a chance. {{BATSMAN}} st Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That's not a bad debut at all. Dropped a catch in the first innings but walked in to bat in all his elements. Was a bit overamibtious here, you could say, and {{BOWLER}} has beaten him with a 134ks delivery. {{BATSMAN}} tried a hack across the line, missed the seam-up delivery and lost the top of his off-stump. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 22(10) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gowtham!! Juggled and taken. Gowtham must be a relieved man. For a second it seemed like he parried it over. {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down and gets close to the wrong 'un, smokes it flat and hard towards long-on, Gowtham times his jump and goes reverse cup, but the ball bursts out and luckily for him goes straight up, he gathers himself and completes the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Gowtham b {{BOWLER}} 5(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Two overs, two wickets. {{BOWLER}} is the late-bloomer we all want to be. He was driven on the up last ball, so drags the length back this time. Just a bit. {{BATSMAN}} was looking to nudge a single to mid-wicket at best, but is early into the shot. Perhaps the ball held up and the leading edge was devoured by {{BOWLER}}. And the celebrations followed. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 13(6) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by M Pandey!! {{BATSMAN}} perishes just short of the finish line. It's a flat leg-break outside off, {{BATSMAN}} wants to cut but the ball turns away sharply and takes a thick top-edge. It loops up to the left of Pandey at point who takes a really sharp catch diving across. End of a fine knock, and surely a match-winning one. {{BATSMAN}} c M Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 84(46) [4s-9 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! GL can do no wrong today. While {{TEAM}} cannot find a way to stop the slump. What was {{BATSMAN}} thinking playing that shot? Quicker and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the heave into the leg-side, skies it towards deep mid-wicket. The ball hung in the air for a long time. Kishan had a fair distance to cover, he reaches there and slides across to cling on. Super take from the youngster. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 3(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Warner!! Caught at long-off. This is a big wicket, make no mistake about that. And brought about by a man coming into the side today. Nicely done. Preempts the fact that {{BATSMAN}} is going for his shots, bowls it short and wide - taking a leaf out from Bhuvi's last over - and has {{BATSMAN}} toe-end the forehand slap kinda shot to Warner in the deep. Simplest of catches that; {{BOWLER}} completely undid him with lack of pace. {{BATSMAN}} c Warner b {{BOWLER}} 53(28) [4s-4 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! Gets him with the googly. 100th T20 wicket for {{BOWLER}}. It was flighted up on leg-stump, once {{BATSMAN}} saw that line he knelt down to sweep. But there was a bit of extra bounce with this delivery which produced the top-edge. Raina accepts the dolly at short fine leg. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 24(19) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Klaasen!! The fat lady's whisper can be heard. That was a terrific take from Klaasen. The slower delivery and the batsman backed away to steer the cut, the shot was not too away from the keeper, who leapt to his right and takes it. Superb day behind the sticks for the RR keeper. First with the bat and now with the ball. {{TEAM}} fans continue to wear a disappointed look. {{BATSMAN}} c Klaasen b {{BOWLER}} 7(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Chahar!! Flays one straight down the throat of third man. {{BATSMAN}} is disappointed, but he has done his job. Was lured by the width on offer and went chasing, makes a mess of the connection though, it slices the thick outside edge and drops as a dolly into the hands of junior Chahar. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Chahar b {{BOWLER}} 47(30) [4s-8 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Southee!! {{BATSMAN}} holes out and the local boy {{BOWLER}} has his arms raised in triumph. Short at the body, {{BATSMAN}} pulls but this is a big ground, so didn't have the power to clear Southee at deep backward square. He is a very good fielder and won't drop those. An important wicket for {{BATSMAN}} is one man who can score at a fast clip. {{BATSMAN}} c Southee b {{BOWLER}} 13(19) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina! GONE! A very full one outside off, {{BATSMAN}}, in a bid to up the ante, throws it all behind that carve over cover, ends up scooping it towards Raina at cover, who picks up yet another catch for himself. {{TEAM}}'s morale is inversely proportional to the {{TEAM}}R. Six down. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 9(8) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Wickets are tumbling towards the death but the total is more than enough. {{BOWLER}} nails his yorker right and uproots the leg-stump as {{BATSMAN}} fails to squeeze it out. Some decent death bowling by Kings XI Punjab. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by U Yadav!! There's the miscue. It was coming. This entire stay was so un-{{BATSMAN}}. Slogging, but with good reason. So he gets a fuller-slower one now, he's camping on his back foot, goes to smoke it straight over. Doesn't time, gets it off the bottom half, flies high. And down mid-on's backtracking reverse cup. {{BATSMAN}} c U Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 36(20) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! This was always on the cards. And {{BOWLER}}Ji wins this battle between leg-spinners! It was a well flighted delivery and was well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} dashes down the track to play a glory shot. It spins away, goes past his willow and Pant takes off the bails in no time. {{BATSMAN}} st Pant b {{BOWLER}} 12(18)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! The ploy to bring in NCN has worked. He has been superb at the death, but GG needed a wicket here. Fullish length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get underneath it and goes hard on his lofted extra drive. Finds extra cover to perfection. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 24(26) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! The last straw is gone. {{TEAM}} will drown it seems. Too full, flighted as well and the toe-ended push finds the bowler. The bowler stays low and pouches it. DK and team erupt. A hattrick against Aussies and now this. {{BOWLER}} can't do anything wrong at the Eden. A 4-fer in a big game. {{BATSMAN}} ends a horron run in the IPL. He has been off-color throughout and it has ended like that as well. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 11(13)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rashid Khan!! The wheels are falling off, both the set batsmen have been dismissed, this is a smart catch from Rashid at deep cover, runs in, slides forward and takes a good catch - right in front of his chest. Nice bit of bowling from {{BOWLER}}, threw this one slower and wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} jumped down the track, was looking to go over extra-cover, ended up chipping it high and towards deep cover. Rashid does the rest and {{TEAM}} have lost half their side. {{BATSMAN}} c Rashid Khan b {{BOWLER}} 49(42) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! Stunner of a catch from Buttler! Wow! Had to cover a lot of ground from long-off, did so and timed the dive to perfection as well. Mind you, he didn't have the reaction time to do it with ease and so had to really rush. But that's the hallmark of a superb fiel{{BATSMAN}}r, ma{{BATSMAN}} it look like regulation stuff. Ends a fine knock from {{BATSMAN}} who was visibly ja{{BATSMAN}}d. Went for the loft but was undone by the slower ball this time. Sliced it down the ground and on some days, might have survived but not today. Not with Buttler manning that area. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 81(52) [4s-6 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Boult!! Mumbai sink further as {{BOWLER}} bags his second wicket. Was a short ball that was pulled nicely by {{BATSMAN}} but it flew quickly to the man at fine leg. Boult is the man stationed in the {{BATSMAN}}ep who plucks it out of thin air. He's taken blin{{BATSMAN}}rs on numerous occasions previously. Compared to those, this was just a regulation catch for the Kiwi speedster. {{BATSMAN}} c Boult b {{BOWLER}} 27(16) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} won't do it for Delhi tonight. Cannot resist his tailender skills and attempts one shot too many. Steps down and makes room, only a littl though, and misses the lofted drive and the ball clatters his stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 7(4) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! 100 IPL wickets for Sunil {{BOWLER}}! No reaction from the Caribbean; as usual. The off-break from {{BOWLER}} doesn't spin much. Goes straight and crashes into the off-pole. And what was {{BATSMAN}} doing? He backed away a long way to loft it over covers. Missed it by a mile. Beaten on the outside edge. Seven down. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Kedar Jadhav Run Out!! The yorker blocked back, the bowler picks it up with one hand to his left and then has the mind to strike the sticks down at the bowler's end. That was harakiri from Kedar Jadhav as he was backing up so far on a free-hit delivery. That will hurt {{TEAM}} but credit to {{BOWLER}} as he had the brain to take the opportunity. Kedar Jadhav run out ({{BOWLER}}) 9(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! First breakthrough for SRH totally against the run of play. Once again the familiar culprit doing the trick - the slower ball. It was on a good length and wide of off. {{BATSMAN}} is early into his stroke - the slash. In the end, slices it straight into the bucket hands of Dhawan at cover-point. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 24(19) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Boult!! The old warhorse has broken through for DD. Must say that this was on the cards with {{BATSMAN}} really struggling to get going. Needed a move on and perishes in the process. The leg break from {{BOWLER}} and invites the Australian to slog against the turn. Risky shot when there is some spin and it skews high off the outer half towards long-off. Boult ain't dropping those. {{BATSMAN}} c Boult b {{BOWLER}} 14(23) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Iyer nails a direct-hit and it's curtains for {{BATSMAN}}! Challenges the opposition skipper's arm and has to pay the price for it. Played this one towards mid-off and called for a single but he was never going to make it. Not the kind of start Mumbai Indians were looking for. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Shreyas Iyer) 2(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Corey Anderson!! That's a screamer! Corey Anderson has taken the catch of the tournament. DK has to go. {{BOWLER}} darts a scrambled seam delivery on a fullish length just outside off. With mid-off inside the circle, the lofted off-drive shot was on. {{BATSMAN}} goes for it, but couldn't quite get the required timing. His bat turns at the point of impact. The Kiwi all-rounder at mid-off, times his jump to perfection and plucks it with his left hand. The ball had almost gone past him. {{BATSMAN}} c Corey Anderson b {{BOWLER}} 65(34) [4s-5 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rayudu!! Rayudu almost threatened the umpire into raising the finger with his loud shrieks for a caught behind appeal. Poor Nand Kishore had no other option but to agree. But a clear edge on that. So well done. UltraEdge shows nothing though. But the seam changed direction after passing the bat which is an indicator. {{BATSMAN}} backed away to squeeze it out and looked like there was a clear deflection. We will never know the truth. {{BATSMAN}} c Rayudu b {{BOWLER}} 16(15) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Yorked! 108kph from {{BOWLER}} again as he fires it in from round the wicket, and it slips right underneath {{BATSMAN}} who was late on the ball. Knocks over the base of off stump. His struggle at the crease, worth 9 balls, ends. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! Oopsy! {{BATSMAN}} is out against the run of play. Certainly not a great delivery, could have been easily put away, but as luck would have it, the bat turned in {{BATSMAN}}'s hands and brought about his downfall. Number one down for Punjab after a brisk 46-run opening stand. This was a full ball, {{BATSMAN}} wanted the flick again having missed out off the third bal of the over, but he totally mistimed it and offered a simple catch to Pollard at mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 26(21) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nair!! No {{BATSMAN}} show today. Falls cheaply and it's the youngster from Afghanistan, who has struck in his first over. Full credit to Ashwin, perfectly set a trap and {{BATSMAN}} has fallen into it. It was the googly from Rahman, {{BATSMAN}} cleared his front leg and whacked across the line, forgets there is a fielder in the deep. Nair nearly made a hash of it as he misjudged it initially. Recovers in time by diving head first at deep mid-wicket and pouched it superbly. {{BATSMAN}} c Nair b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Zaheer!! One shot too many for {{BATSMAN}}. Another googly but it has a lot of flight. {{BATSMAN}} goes for the sweep again and top edges to Zaheer at short fine leg. {{BOWLER}} has struck soon and once he gets a wicket early in the spell he can be lethal, especially on these kind of tracks. {{BATSMAN}} c Zaheer b {{BOWLER}} 34(25) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} draws first blood! Was getting the ball to shape inwards and {{BATSMAN}} was never going to die wondering irrespective of the surface. Sits back to this nip backer and goes for an agricultural slog, only to miss it altogether. Past the inside edge and raps him on the back leg. Looked quite plumb in real time and I don't think a review would have saved {{BATSMAN}}. Hence, he walks back to the hut. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nabi!! {{BATSMAN}} would be gutted with himself. He was timing the ball beautifully but the pressure of five dot balls that de Kock consumed in the previous over probably got to him. And he played an overambitious pull-shot. {{BOWLER}} got the ball to bounce extra off the deck. It hit the splice of the bat and popped up in the air, Nabi takes a sitter of sitters at mid-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Nabi b {{BOWLER}} 24(18) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Duminy!! {{BATSMAN}} departs for a blob. Not a sweet IPL 2018 debut for the Kiwi all-rounder. {{BOWLER}} gets two in two. Slowish and lured {{BATSMAN}} into a big shot. The batsmen went low and slogged, no timing whatsoever and he ended up hitting it straight to deep mid-wicket. {{BOWLER}} is chuffed, so are rest of his team-mates. {{TEAM}} digging a hole for themselves here. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Duminy b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Corey Anderson!! {{BOWLER}} misses the blockhole and delivers a full toss, {{BATSMAN}} advances and converts it into a slightly higher full toss than he would have liked. It takes him by surprise a bit. He swings hard, it hits him high on the bat and he ends up slicing it straight down to long-off. Had he stayed his ground, would have been a much simpler ball to hit. {{BATSMAN}} c Corey Anderson b {{BOWLER}} 33(25) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nair!! Edged and caught! That bounce from {{BOWLER}}, it's the undoing of yet another {{TEAM}} batsman, they have lost both openers now. Banged in short and curving away from the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} didn't cover for the angle as he fended at that, doesn't get on top of the bounce and gets a thick outside edge. The ball looped and was dying on its way to Karun, but he bends forward and takes a good low catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Nair b {{BOWLER}} 11(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! The ball rears up, the batsman fails to get his hands out of the way and manages to edge it for Raina to take it at first slip. Good captaincy as he had himself there for this ball. All going GL's way. {{BATSMAN}} has a look of disbelief as he stares at the wicket. He had no clue as to how the ball sprung up from that length. On a hat-trick is {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by A Russell!! {{BATSMAN}} could'nt have picked the fielder out any better. Surely, will be disappointed. Anyway, {{BOWLER}} retaliates and gets his revenge. Went wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} slashed it hard and straight to deep cover. Russel was under it and he won't drop those. It was an off-pace ball and KW had to generate some power to elevate it over the fielder's head. 2 or 3 inches away from Russel, it would've been a boundary. Nonetheless, KKR will breathe a sigh of relief as they break this dangerous stand. {{BATSMAN}} c A Russell b {{BOWLER}} 36(17) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Cutting!! {{BOWLER}} wins the battle with {{BATSMAN}}. He has sent Wankhede rocking. Slower ball, it deceives {{BATSMAN}} as he lofts it right off the toe-end into the grateful hands of Cutting at long-off. So then, is that it for Punjab? {{BATSMAN}} c Cutting b {{BOWLER}} 94(60) [4s-10 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bairstow!! One brings two!! {{BOWLER}} uses his height and bowls the scramble seam short of length delivery outside off, Faf made room early and was looking to go over cover, gets a faint outside edge and YJB does the rest behind the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} c Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 45(31) [4s-3 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Mayank Agarwal!! It's an easy ploy for a bowler on this pitch. When the batsman is looking to score big, all you have to do is take pace of the ball and ensure it's not too full. {{BATSMAN}} sliced that drive with one hand, flew high over cover, the substitute fielder makes no mistake in the deep. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Mayank Agarwal b {{BOWLER}} 55(48) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! This is turning out to be an outstanding final over from {{BOWLER}}. {{TEAM}} falling away. Another top-notch full delivery, straightening on and {{BATSMAN}} exposes his stumps. Trying to make some room and misses it completely. The stumps are shattered and {{BOWLER}} picks up his second wicket. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Fifty and gone. Slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} was early into his uppish tuck. {{BATSMAN}} was through with his shot too early and the ball soared away for it to be taken at deep mid by Pandya, who moved across to his left and took it. End of a game changing innings from Mo! MI will take this with both hands. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 50(32) [4s-1 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Oh dear. It's easy to be critical of players sometimes, but what was {{BATSMAN}} thinking here. First ball against a bowler who's bowling so well, he comes galloping down for an ugly slog. Completely done in by the length as this googly slips through the inside edge for an easy stumping. {{BATSMAN}} st Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Harbhajan!! Kolkata are dominos and Harbhajan - if not pushing them out on his own, continues having himself in some form or the other on the scorecard. This time, courtesy a lame flick uppishly off his legs, picking out a funky silly mid-on perfectly. {{BATSMAN}} c Harbhajan b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! What a ripper! The decision to persist with {{BOWLER}} has paid dividends for Gambhir. Good aggressive captaincy. But what a ball though! Phew! One of those jaffas that you get in Test cricket generally and {{BATSMAN}} must be wondering where it came from. Angled into him from a good length and shaped away with a spit of extra bounce. Unplayable by any means and it flies off the outside edge. Pant reacted sharply too and flung himself to his left to take a good diving catch. What a huge wicket this is! {{TEAM}} are jolted early. {{BATSMAN}} was looking to up the ante, has to depart. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 16(12) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! Taken! That ball was in the air for quite some time but Bravo was calm and composed to gobble it up. {{BATSMAN}} had to go after the left-arm spinner, he heaves it with all his might towards deep mid-wicket, but got more air time than distance. Bravo never looked in trouble while taking that. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Bravo b {{BOWLER}} 32(30) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Warner!! The start SRH would have wanted after being restricted to a modest score. Look at Warner go, he's pumped up, this could lift his team as well. Back of a length and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was slightly cramped up on the pull, gets a steepling top-edge towards mid-off and Warner made sure that everyone else stayed away. Watched it all along and held on, a fist pump from {{BOWLER}} as he exults. {{BATSMAN}} c Warner b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Siraj!! {{BOWLER}} has his bunny. He has made it a habit of removing the Aussie. Had the better of him during the ODI and T20 leg in 2017. Now also was held back by Kohli specifically for this. Flighted leg-break on off and middle, {{BATSMAN}} tries the fancy reverse sweep and is undone by the extra bounce, the top-edge balloons towards short third man, Siraj runs to his right, dives full length and manages to cling on. {{BATSMAN}} c Siraj b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Oh goodness! Has he got another one? Has MSD pulled off a stumping here? {{BOWLER}} is already celebrating and yes, {{BATSMAN}} has started to walk. {{TEAM}} in complete disarry now with six down. It was the googly from {{BOWLER}}, such deception that {{BATSMAN}} is foxed by the spin. Goes searching for the drive away from his body and doesn't read it at all. It beats his inside edge and overbalances himself by dragging his back leg out of his crease. MSD was quick to spot it and whips the bails off in a flash. No need to go upstairs as well. CSK all over {{TEAM}} like a rash. {{BATSMAN}} st Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 9(12)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! He's skied this up off the outside half and is caught down at long-off. No hundred for Jos {{BATSMAN}}, who wasn't playing for it either. Saw the flight and went for it. This is very well bowled from {{BOWLER}} as he slowed it up and teased him with a leg-break well outside off. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 89(43) [4s-7 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! That is a steal. Full toss outside off and the batsman chips the drive to cover. DJ Bravo takes it and breaks into a jig. For a moment he has forgotten about the damage done. That was a poor delivery but {{BATSMAN}} got carried away and lifted the ball aerially for the man at cover, who was on the edge of the circle, to take it. CSK have a small ray of hope. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Bravo b {{BOWLER}} 37(22) [4s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Lynn!! Slower dipping full toss and the slog sweep, sans any power, finds the man at square leg. Huge wicket or a blessing in disguise for KKR? Tough to say. It would bring in Gowtham. Three dot balls from him will hurt {{TEAM}}. But my word, this boy is special. Nailed the blockhole stuff and slower balls to perfection. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Lynn b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Duck for {{BATSMAN}}! Couldn't have been a better start for the Royals, this. {{BATSMAN}} not having a great time, dropped a catch earlier and departs without troubling the scorers. It's a short delivery and with a bit of off-spin, {{BATSMAN}} goes back to cut and gets undone due to the lack of bounce and spin on that. No {{BATSMAN}} special tonight and the crowd at Jaipur erupts. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! Brainfade for the Delhi Capitals skipper. A googly around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} goes down in order to slog it but ends up getting a top-edge. The ball skies up towards Raina at point who settles underneath it and takes it safely. CSK on top, Delhi in trouble. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 13(18) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Dragged on. No heroics from {{BATSMAN}} today. MI are chipping away at the wickets. Five down and {{BOWLER}} has his name on wicket's list. The umpire checks for a no-ball and {{BOWLER}} has some part of his foot behind the stumps. Good length ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the pull and the ball does not bounce as much as he anticipated, the inside edge crashes into the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 7(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jofra Archer!! {{BATSMAN}} perishes in his quest to clear long-on. Goes down on his knee to thump this one over the fence but miscues it completely. The ball goes miles up in the air and Jofra in the deep settles underneath the skier. Waits for an eternity but does well to position himself under the night sky as he reverse cups it to perfection. {{BATSMAN}} c Jofra Archer b {{BOWLER}} 26(12) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kuldeep Yadav!! And he's gone.. {{BATSMAN}} is livid. Lets out a grunt before storming off. {{BOWLER}} went round the wicket and hurled it across the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} shuffled across and did well to get under the ball to play the scoop, couldn't find the elevation and Kuldeep takes a good catch at short fine. Either side and that would have been a boundary. FYI, maiden IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Kuldeep Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 34(20) [6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Gone. {{BATSMAN}} is quick but not as quick as he was in his international playing days. Even then this single may have been tight. Smeared it to mid-off and ran, hoped Hardik would miss but he didn't. End of story. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Hardik Pandya) 37(25) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! The skiddy pace of {{BOWLER}} gets {{BATSMAN}}. Was a short and quick delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} went ahead with his pull and got a top edge to mid-on. DJ Bravo won't miss those as he settles underneath and reverse cups it. Two of {{TEAM}}'s finest batsmen are back to the hut. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Bravo b {{BOWLER}} 6(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sarfaraz Khan!! Oh dear! That's a horror shot from KL, he was looking so good and now plays an atrocious heave, pushed through quicker and wider of off, KL was looking to mow it over the mid-wicket fence, doesn't get anywhere near the pitch of the ball, the fat top-edge loops towards short third man where Sarfaraz takes it with glee. End of a handy knock from the KXIP opener. {{BATSMAN}} c Sarfaraz Khan b {{BOWLER}} 47(30) [4s-2 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by R Bhatia!! Bhatia has made amends. Put a sitter down early in the innings, this time keeps his eyes on the ball and ends {{BATSMAN}}'s knock. It was the googly which was drifting away from the southpaw, {{BATSMAN}} went down and slog swept it flat, Bhatia didn't have to move at deep mid-wicket to pouch that. {{BATSMAN}} c R Bhatia b {{BOWLER}} 34(28) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, byes, 1 run, 140.6kph, shortish ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} wafts and is beaten by the pace and bounce. The batsmen decide to sneak a run via byes. Karthik lobs it to the bowler, but {{BOWLER}} misses the target at his end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! That's Pollard for you. Freak on the field. And {{BOWLER}} roars in delight. Dangerous 69-run stand broken. This was a flighted delivery wide outside off stump, something that left-arm spinners do against left-handed batsmen to take the leg-side out of play, {{BATSMAN}} tries to muscle the ball hard through the off-side, wanted to hit towards cover, but he hit straight and Pollard ran quickly to his left, dived and took it air-borne. {{BATSMAN}} misses a deserved fifty by three runs. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 47(25) [4s-6 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tom Curran!! He's mistimed this high in the air and deep mid-wicket takes it. Short ball, {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull, came off the bottom of the bat as the ball came slowly onto him. Walks off to a great applause, raises the bat to the crowd. He really wanted to end this game in a hurry. What a top knock though. It was so good to watch him score quick runs with proper cricketing shots. {{BATSMAN}} c Tom Curran b {{BOWLER}} 60(27) [4s-9 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! Now {{BATSMAN}} departs. Wheels coming off the chase. {{BATSMAN}}, like the previous occasion, stepped down again. This time {{BOWLER}} is smart enough to shorten the length. However, that does not deter {{BATSMAN}} who goes with the shot, whips it well but does not get the elevation. Rohit Sharma at mid-wicket leaps a bit and plucks it. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 21(15) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karn Sharma!! Short ball and it devours {{BATSMAN}}. He was trying to make some room but saw that the line was pretty close to his body. Decided to go for the pull, but the ball skid on. Could not get enough power behind the shot and found long-on to his left. {{BATSMAN}} c Karn Sharma b {{BOWLER}} 10(8) [4s-2]S\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Williamson!! Running out of words to describe this shambolic batting from {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} goes for the hack and had to drag it off the toe-end, the ball was spinning away from him and that made it all the more difficult to execute the shot. Skies up off the toe-end and KW takes a sitter at cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Williamson b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Back-to-back wickets for GL. Once more {{BATSMAN}} has thrown away a start. He did that against MI as well and he's team suffered a big loss. Today as well after Amla's wicket, he needed to stay there and bat till the end. Instead he tries an ambitious reverse sweep against {{BOWLER}}, who always attacks the stumps, struck in-line with middle and the slow dreaded finger of umpire Anil Chaudhary went up. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 31(18) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by S Kaul!! Sunrisers' best bowler strikes, gets the young opener. Tossed up delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes after it with a slog and gets a top edge to short third man. Kaul stationed in the position goes down on his knee and reverse cups it. Fine knock by {{BATSMAN}}, nevertheless. He has laid the foundation for the likes of Pant and other Delhi batsmen. {{BATSMAN}} c S Kaul b {{BOWLER}} 65(36) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! Poor shot selection from Ben {{BATSMAN}}. Carrom ball bowled wide of off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} drags the slogsweep from there and hits it straight to the man at deep mid-wicket. Axar trundles forward and gobbles it with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 4(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Chahal Run Out!! Direct-hit and that's it! SRH with a comprehensive win in the IPL 10 opener. Another pull shot from {{BATSMAN}}, this one's straight to mid-wicket. Chahal comes running down only to be sent back and he had given up. Jordan with the bull's eye. Chahal run out (Jordan) 3(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Warrier!! DK's ploy to bring {{BOWLER}} works wonders for KKR. It was that sort of a delivery where you have too much time and end up tripping over while playing the shot. Short, slow and drifting in, {{BATSMAN}} rocked back and nailed the pull as hard as he could, sends the toe-end flat to the fielder at deep mid-wicket. Warrier, who's been involved in all three dismissals so far, claims the catch with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Warrier b {{BOWLER}} 48(27) [4s-3 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! {{BOWLER}} strikes! Bowls a carrom ball in the channel outside off, {{BATSMAN}} looks to slice it but all he can manage is a feather to it. Sharp catch by Rahul and the gritty partnership has been broken. Probably a blessing in disguise for the batting team as the pair was consuming too many deliveries. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 26(27) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Two dots and {{BATSMAN}} is trapped lbw. He has a chat with his partner and takes the right call - doesn't review. What a start for Mayank {{BOWLER}}! After two leg-breaks, he bowls a googly and gets a wicket off the third ball in his IPL career. A premeditated shot attempted by {{BATSMAN}}. Got down on his knee and tried to play the booming sweep shot. Missed and got hit on the back thigh in front of middle. That's plumb. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 22(19) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Dwayne Smith Run Out!! This is disaster for Gujarat Lions. Both the openers gone in successive balls. Who is to be blamed here? {{BATSMAN}} took a couple of steps out of his crease after playing this ball gently to mid-wicket, Smith thought the skipper was keen on a run, but was shocked when {{BATSMAN}} stopped suddenly. The West Indian tried to rush back but a bullet throw from Nadeem meant his bat was on the line when the stumps were disturbed. Dwayne Smith run out (Nadeem) 9(4) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! {{TEAM}} are coming apart here in the death overs. Must say that the RR bowlers have been smart as well in reading the surface and executing the plans. {{BOWLER}} does what he does best, a slower ball on a good length that {{BATSMAN}} wants to biff by making room. He has no other choice at this stage, does he? However, doesn't connect it well at all and slices it high towards backward point where the RR skipper does the rest. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 16(15) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Typically tail-ender like. {{BATSMAN}} clearly (and smartly) keeps backing away to save getting hit and this time {{BOWLER}}'s not taking chances. He's kept it really full, on middle, and is uprooting middle. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! One brings two for DD and this is a massive wicket. The in-form {{BATSMAN}} departs second ball. It's a first-ball wicket for {{BOWLER}} as well. Drifts this in just around off, straightens a tad off the deck as {{BATSMAN}} went for a wild hoick across the line. Bizarre shot to play very early in the innings but he probably thought that the surface is good to start blasting straight away. Got burnt eventually. Just the kind of momentum DD were looking for. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! Straight up in the air and caught at deep mid. {{BATSMAN}} slogs the slower delivery and doesn't have the elevation to clear the fielder in the deep. Respite for {{BOWLER}} who has had an absolute mare tonight - removing the wicket-maiden against Kohli and AB. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 32(17) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Guptill!! ABD goes. Big, big wicket for SRH and they are cock-a-hoop. Like Kohli, it's a sorry end to {{BATSMAN}}' IPL campaign as he falls cheaply. But it was a nothing shot from the South African. It was shortish and curled away outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, he just flirted his bat at it without any intent and gui{{BATSMAN}}d it straight into the hands of Guptill at slip. VVS Laxman is all smiles in the dug-out. {{TEAM}} in all sorts of trouble now. {{BATSMAN}} c Guptill b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! Was a short of a length delivery on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} went for a pull and got an inside edge before the ball clipped his pads and carried to Watson in the slip. The on field umpire couldn't pick that up in the background noise but UltraEdge comes to {{BOWLER}}'s rescue. {{BATSMAN}} is back to the hut and all of a sudden there are CSK, CSK chants at the ground. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 12(6) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! Can a wicket keeper take a wicket? He sure can. Catches like those should be awarded to the keeper. Short delivery, got big on the batsman, he went for the pull and managed a big plump edge. The ball skied upwards and stayed there till eternity till Saha circled under it after running back and then despite misjudging it, threw himself in the air to take it out of thin air. Superb take from the mitts-man. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 28(34) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Faint tickle from {{BATSMAN}}, and that's it. {{TEAM}} bowled out with nine balls to go. Flat leg-break, {{BATSMAN}} makes room to drive off the back foot but it climbs on him due to the overspin imparted. Dhoni takes care of the edge. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! {{BATSMAN}} departs for a duck and RCB are in a total mess in the Lion's den. {{BATSMAN}} taps it to the off-side and charges for a single, there was no response from Parthiv Patel and {{BATSMAN}} was stranded in the middle. Raina at cover comes quickly and hurls the ball to MS who knocks off the bails. {{BATSMAN}} was nowhere close to coming back. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Raina/Dhoni) 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! The yorkerish delivery was jammed out and it popped up. KKR think it went off the boot and into the keeper's gloves. They may be right!! It seems the batsman did jam it out off the inner half of the bat but into his boot. And then it went up for DK to take it and bring to the notice of the umpires that they should go upstairs. They did, the soft signal was not out but was not to be as the replays were conclusive enough for the third umpire to make the decision. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 1(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Snuck through him. {{BOWLER}} slides one on from round the wicket and completely cramps {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} may have initially wanted to cut it away but the ball just skids on rapidly and cleans up middle and leg. Poor shot against someone like {{BOWLER}} who doesn't turn the ball a great deal. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 13(17) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bairstow!! Kumar's worked {{BATSMAN}} out with a short ball. The {{TEAM}} captain doesn't even wait for the umpire to raise his finger as he trudges off the field. It's Bhuvi's 100th scalp for SRH. Followed a full ball with a spicy short delivery, {{BATSMAN}} was backing away and tried to ramp it over the keeper but failed in execution. Gets a slight edge and Bairstow makes no mistake. The partnership has been broken. {{BATSMAN}} c Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 45(40) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Navdeep Saini!! Dream start for RCB as {{BATSMAN}} departs for a duck. Pitches this one up and tempts the batsman to go after it. The left-handed batsman goes for a booming drive and gets an outside edge that flies to short third man. Saini is swift to move across as he plucks this one nicely before he hits the ground. The crowd is ecstatic as the Kiwi pacer strikes early. {{BATSMAN}} c Navdeep Saini b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} gets another wicket with a juicy full-toss. {{TEAM}} finish with just 157 on the board. {{BATSMAN}} made room on the drive, missed and the off-stump goes for a walk. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Huge wicket in the context for CSK and it's {{BOWLER}} who's got his England skipper. Surprises {{BATSMAN}} with a short ball and gets good fizz off the pitch to get it climbing and restrain the timing on the shot, {{BATSMAN}} was probably aiming for the deep square region, but the shot lacked intent and MSD does the rest behind the sticks. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 7(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Freaky. Oh absolutely. When {{BOWLER}} doesn't get a wicket off a pin-point accurate yorker, the Gods align themselves to get a run-out. Right on the base of middle and {{BATSMAN}} just about digs it away somehow to short third man. Cummins out there, gathers and catches {{BATSMAN}} in a lazy mood to finish the run. Has a shy at the bowler's end and {{BOWLER}} mid-way gets his hands out of the way. Not before giving it a faint tickle and directing it onto the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Pat Cummins) 12(9) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Given out lbw. {{BATSMAN}} immediately reviews. Has it pitched in line? No under edge on the sweep. UltraEdge throws that up. Umpire's call and {{BATSMAN}} is gone. Erasmus the umpire who was happy to oblige that appeal from {{BOWLER}}. Pitched in line with leg stump and straightened just enough to clip leg. {{BATSMAN}} was beaten on the sweep and has to make his way out. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 45(31) [4s-2 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Boult!! Just the worst of full tosses. No forget that. It's never going to be remembered. Boult has clinched that 10 lakh cheque for the end of the season. It's a catch for the ages. A viral catch. So {{BATSMAN}} quite obviously whips the innocuous, without bothering to keep it down. Over square leg. Boult comes out of nowhere, sticks his right hand up. And it sticks. With him eventually falling in a millimeter in front of the FBB prismic sponsor on the rope. Nobody can seem to believe. Yeah, muggles, it's true. {{BATSMAN}} c Boult b {{BOWLER}} 30(26) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Riyan Parag!! {{BOWLER}} gets {{BATSMAN}}. A floated delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} looks to take on {{BOWLER}} and fails in his quest to clear long-off. Lofts it high up in the air, but fails to get the distance. It's Riyan Parag who completes a safe catch in the deep. This has been the problem with {{BATSMAN}} this season. He's getting those starts, but he's not really able to convert them. {{BATSMAN}} c Riyan Parag b {{BOWLER}} 22(17) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! Gone. {{TEAM}} are impoding here. That was a typical leggie's dismissal. Lan{{BATSMAN}}d outsi{{BATSMAN}} off and turned away, lured the batsman for a drive to catch the edge. There was a slip fiel{{BATSMAN}}r and the captain can give himself a pat on the back. For taking the catch and for having a slip in place. Superb bit of passage for RR. Kohli looks on in shock and dismay. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Kuldeep Yadav Run Out!! Swinging in yorker and a run-out as the keeper lobbed the ball to the bowler who whipped the bails off with the non-stiker stranded in the middle of the crease. {{BATSMAN}} almost fell down failing to wood the yorker and Dhoni behind the sticks did the rest. {{TEAM}} has derailed pretty badly here. Kuldeep Yadav run out (Dhoni/{{BOWLER}}) 0(0)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! Fourth catch for Tewatia. He's having a field day in the deep. {{BATSMAN}}'s show is over, wasn't at his best really, rode his luck quite a bit but the important part was that he stuck in. Nobody else did barring Krunal and to an extent Pollard. This was a slog without any timing. Picked out deep mid-wicket with precision. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Tewatia b {{BOWLER}} 53(35) [4s-5 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Miller!! He's done two things wrong here: a) gone against the angle on this slow short ball from over the wicket, and b) played the slog-pull off the front foot. Misuced to Miller at long-on but he's done his job, has {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Miller b {{BOWLER}} 50(23) [4s-5 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tahir!! The champion strikes! Time to bring out those moves. That shot looked good for a moment but the lack of pace on it results in {{BATSMAN}}'s downfall. Was a short one around off and the southpaw guides it straight into the mitts of Imran Tahir at third man. Had there been some more pace on the ball, it would have probably gone the distance. {{BATSMAN}} c Tahir b {{BOWLER}} 3(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Chops it back on! Poor from {{BATSMAN}}. Hardly has had his eye in, and tries to cut a leg-break from off stump. Gets inevitably cramped for room. Mumbai have more than an opening now, especially given Royals' track-record this season. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! That's a soft dismissal! Nothing back of a length delivery down leg, {{BATSMAN}} tried to glance fine, but got an edge and Dhoni was sharp moving to his right and grabbing that. Unlucky! {{BATSMAN}} started walking before the decision. Can CSK stage a comeback and stall {{TEAM}}? {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 3(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! Cross-seamed one in the slot, which {{BATSMAN}}'s shaping up to smoke somewhere into the desert outside deep mid-wicket. But, but, there's something called not finding the middle, and as shocking as it might sound in this innings for {{BATSMAN}}, this delivery was that. He gets a lot of height, but Jadeja's swirling under at the boundary, reverse-cupping a seriously good catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 33(17) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mustafizur!! Oh boy, how lucky is {{BOWLER}}! Filthy drag-down on leg-stump, but instead of hitting it into Churchgate station, {{BATSMAN}} hits it straight down fine leg's throat. {{BOWLER}} is struggling though as he immediately bends over in evident pain. Absolutely no joy on his face for the wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Mustafizur b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Bhuvi has made amends. He has taken a spectacular catch at fine leg! And the orange army supporters are on their feet in the crowd. Umpires have gone for a review just to be absolutely sure. Soft signal is OUT and he is OUT. It was a terrific short delivery on the face, {{BATSMAN}} was clearly beaten by the pace there. The situation demanded him to play another big shot and he went after it again via: A pull shot. Gets it off the top-half, Bhuvi at fine leg, charges forward, dives in a dramatic fashion and takes a beauty. {{BATSMAN}} c Bhuvneshwar b {{BOWLER}} 21(10) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Moeen Ali Run Out!! This is a big moment. What a direct-hit from the skipper. Mo was starting to time the ball well, a stutter has cost him. {{BATSMAN}} flicked this slower ball in front of short mid-wicket and set off, Ro attacked the ball and knocked the sticks over with a rocket through. The crowd, disappointed for a fleeting moment with the dismissal, yells out a loud roar. Enter King Kohli! Moeen Ali run out (Rohit) 13(7) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shankar!! Nought for {{BATSMAN}}. Been strangled with a slew of dots and he lets the pressure get better off him. A slower full ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} didn't really have the pace to force the uppish drive but he goes for it and chips a dolly of a catch to Vijay Shankar at cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 0(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! \"I have missed my morning jog today\" kinda sprint from Imran {{BOWLER}}. Now this is a wicket handed to him, and he's on a hat-trick here. {{BATSMAN}} is making a comeback into the side, but decides to slog across a wrong 'un which he hadn't picked by a mile. Biding time is so old-fashioned.. The ball sneaks through the bat-pad gap and bowls him. Shambolic shot, to say the least. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! \"Story of {{BATSMAN}}\" is the comment from Sanjay M on air. Apt. Finds cover. Down the track and right off the toe of the bat, can only find the MI skipper there. Clever from {{BOWLER}}, may have seen the batsman coming and bowled it just a bit wide from his reach. An innings which promised so much has been nipped in the bud. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 16(11) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Naman Ojha!! Two down. The slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} can only slog it high up in the air, a fat top edge, Naman Ojha calls for it and takes it with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Naman Ojha b {{BOWLER}} 61(40) [4s-5 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! This was very similar to the Buttler dismissal, the fielding aspect. {{BATSMAN}}'s horror run this season continues. His scores: 18, 0 and 0. Back of a length and close to off, {{BATSMAN}} knocks it towards cover and sets off on a suicidal run, Hardik runs across, gets a good bounce and under-arms a throw onto the sticks at the bowler's end. {{BATSMAN}} was diving to make his ground, but was still short. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Hardik Pandya) 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Short ball, {{BATSMAN}} top-edges it high into the air, both keeper and the bowler go for it without any sort of communication. Ankit {{BOWLER}} charges and clasps it safely before crashing into Pooran who seems to have taken some serious knock on the head from the big man. Good effort from {{BOWLER}} to keep his eyes on the ball and not fumble despite tumbling after the crash. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shakib!! {{BOWLER}} is too good for a debutant. Takes the pace off again with his knuckles and gets the ball to dart away. And {{BATSMAN}}, overcommitted on the front foot, reaches out, only to slice that over to extra cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Shakib b {{BOWLER}} 3(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by R Tripathi!! This is going to hand. Slower delivery, {{BATSMAN}} jumped out of the crease to cut, but this one bounced a tad extra, so {{BATSMAN}} couldn't keep it down, easy grab at backward point. {{BATSMAN}} c R Tripathi b {{BOWLER}} 14(10) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! And another one gone. This knuckle ball epidemic is getting to every Indian pacer. {{BOWLER}} the latest to show it off. Lands it on a length and {{BATSMAN}} thinking it was a normal length delivery, goes through the line with the loft, miscues it completely and Hooda runs forward from long-on to pouch that. {{BATSMAN}} was the key and even he is sent back. {{BATSMAN}} c Deepak Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 28(31) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Andrew Tye!! {{TEAM}} are not finishing on a high! {{BATSMAN}} falls after a fine cameo, this was a slower length ball from Sran, {{BATSMAN}} was deep in the crease as he shovelled it towards the on-side, went off the inner half of the bat and straight to Tye at deep backward square leg. He takes it reverse cupped and KXIP continue to chip away at the wickets. {{BATSMAN}} c Andrew Tye b {{BOWLER}} 43(28) [4s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Tripathi Run Out!! That's superb from {{BOWLER}}, but equally horrendous running. Never a run there. {{BOWLER}} sees {{BATSMAN}} coming down and spears it into his pads. The ball rolls away beside the pitch and they decide to go through for a single. {{BATSMAN}} had a headstart there which may have swayed his thinking. Tripathi was never going to get there. {{BOWLER}} swoops across, picks up the ball and fires the stump with Tripathi two-three feet short. Tripathi run out ({{BOWLER}}) 59(41) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ashwin!! That's mistimed and only goes as far as cover. Normal seam-up delivery, full again for a big hit, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to go over long-off, sliced it high in the air and the KXIP makes no mistake. Important thing is Dhoni has crossed over and will be on strike now. {{BATSMAN}} c Ashwin b {{BOWLER}} 19(13) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! Told ya, it's boom-or-bust and in all fairness, {{BATSMAN}} didn't have too many options there. Went for a mighty slog against a slower full ball and the moment it left the bat, he almost fell backwards before limping awkwardly behind the stumps. The slog came off the toe-end and Kohli accepts the dolly at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} is being helped off the field by the physio.{{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Sweet vengeance for {{BOWLER}} as he comes back on the very next ball having conceded a boundary. Full, quick and swinging into the batsman. {{BATSMAN}} goes for a drive with lack of footwork and gets rapped on the pads. Impact on middle and this would have crashed into middle and leg. Good call by the openers to not opt for the review, else they would have regretted it after watching the replays. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 4(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Binny!! {{BOWLER}} rushes {{BATSMAN}} and gets rid of him. Really tame dismissal actually. He's pulling on the front foot, the ball is onto him quicker than expected and it hits him right on the splice. It spoons up for an easy catch to long-on. Bangalore keep hitting back, they keep fighting. {{BATSMAN}} c Binny b {{BOWLER}} 13(12) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chahar!! {{BOWLER}} on a roll. Third wicket for him in just his second over. Another googly wide of off, and in throwing his hands at it, {{BATSMAN}} has sliced it to backward point. Delhi sinking quickly. {{BATSMAN}} c Chahar b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Castled! Massive breakthrough as {{BOWLER}} goes right through a dangerous {{BATSMAN}}. Pitched right up, finds movement off the seam as it comes in off the deck. {{BATSMAN}} hadn't bargained for it. He threw his hands on the drive without any footwork. It's a shot you play on a flat pitch. This, however, has something in it. Bowls him through the gate. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 25(18) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Corey Anderson!! Wicket right after the break and it is Anderson, who has pulled another terrific catch. Full and on the stumps, bit too full for {{BATSMAN}} to get underneath that, but he still goes through with it and spoons it towards long-on. The ball was dying in front of an onrushing Anderson, but he gets there with a dive. Takes it inches from the ground. The umpires send it upstairs and it is an easy one for the TV ump. {{BATSMAN}} c Corey Anderson b {{BOWLER}} 40(28) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Vijay! {{BOWLER}} is amidst a magnificent spell, choking the Mumbai batsmen with his spin. Tosses this one up around off and {{BATSMAN}} has to stretch in order to reach out. Lifts the ball high up in the air but fails in his quest to the clear the long-on boundary. Tired looking shot by the skipper but he's laid the foundation. Hopefully, Pollard and Pandya finish it off in style. They need to play out {{BOWLER}} first. {{BATSMAN}} c Vijay b {{BOWLER}} 67(48) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! Back to back wickets for Rajasthan. Two new batsmen at the crease. Not what Mumbai would have wanted. {{BATSMAN}} nee{{BATSMAN}}d to be smarter and batted through. He {{BATSMAN}}ci{{BATSMAN}}s to take on {{BOWLER}}'s googly and miscues it horribly towards long-on, Stokes settles un{{BATSMAN}}r it and he ain't dropping those. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 65(47) [4s-6 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Kaboom! Who says the yorker has gone out of fashion? It never has and it never will. Lovely yorker from {{BOWLER}}, on the base of off stump and {{BATSMAN}} was making room to slam it through cover. Too good a nut for him and he fails to get his bat down in time. Timber it is! DD finish on 166/7. Is it enough? {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 13(13) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} makes a mess of the stumps. The off and middle are uprooted completely. But {{BATSMAN}} has done his job. A quickfire 69 has set {{TEAM}} up for a strong finish. This was a full delivery and had {{BATSMAN}} not given himself room, he would have been in a position to put it away, not to be and the ball crashed into the stumps after beating the swinging willow. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 69(39) [4s-6 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by U Yadav!! If the rain break didn't bring about a wicket, the strategic break did. {{BATSMAN}} does not kick-on. Perishes while trying to up the ante. The off-break from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} makes a bit of room, sits down and slog sweeps, made a decent enough connection, at least I thought with the sound when ball made contact with the bat, but it towards deep square leg. Umesh judged the boundary rope to perfection and hung on. {{BATSMAN}} c U Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 52(43) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Shreyas Gopal Run Out!! Wicket to end the innings. That sums up the innings for Royals as Rahul denies them the bye. It was a slower delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} was early in his pull again, got beaten and as Gopal tried to sneak in a bye, Rahul had a direct hit at the striker's end. Shreyas Gopal run out (Rahul) 24(16) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, SRH review. It's a referral against {{BATSMAN}} for an lbw. But I think this was sliding down the leg side, and Hyderabad will lose their review in that case.. As I look at the replays, it's pitching outside leg as well. {{BATSMAN}} tried to whip it through the on side, but couldn't connect it..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! {{BOWLER}} is good. He is too good, specially at the death. It's the slower back of a length delivery from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} knew that was coming, still couldn't put it away. Went deep in his crease and went too hard on the pull. Mistimed to deep mid-wicket. Straightforward catch for RJ. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 29(17) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Axar!! It's not that {{BATSMAN}} had much of a choice apart from hopeful bat-swings. But {{BOWLER}} had this shorter, slower, hence ruining the timing on {{BATSMAN}}'s attempted heave over mid-wicket. The miscue is a top-edge, and the {{BOWLER}}-unity will do it by the boundary. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Axar b {{BOWLER}} 58(35) [4s-4 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chahal!! Umm, who's surprised. 23 off 3 needed, why not hit a few sixes. Throws his bat at a wide back of a length delivery but slices it up in the air, for extra cover to grab hold of it on the edge of the ring. Kohli flashes a thumbs up. Why not. {{BATSMAN}} c Chahal b {{BOWLER}} 39(16) [4s-2 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Uthappa!! Uthappa pumps his fists. KKR find a lifeline once again. Full delivery and right in the slot, had {{BATSMAN}} stayed put without moving to the leg-side, he could have connected with the loft better, instead he had to reach out and managed only a toe-end to long-off. Uthappa ran across to his left to pouch that. Nevertheless, {{BATSMAN}} has given {{TEAM}} a chance to pull this off and Chepauk might have found a new hero in him. {{BATSMAN}} c Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 56(23) [4s-2 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! A 20-run over from {{BOWLER}} has been redeemed right at the end. {{BATSMAN}}'s gone. But has the damage been done? Short ball, {{BATSMAN}} swings hard but slices it up to extra-cover. Seven needed from six. Get ready to lose your mind. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 68(30) [4s-3 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Finally, finally. The show is over. {{BOWLER}} plays the anti-cupid's role. Totally deserves this wicket. From round the wicket, bowls it full and gets it to curl back in sharply, just an inch short of an yorker. {{BATSMAN}} was late to bring his bat down there. Misses it and is pinged on the boot. Right in front of middle and looked dead straightaway. {{BOWLER}} is chuffed. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 77(38) [4s-5 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Two in two. Before this ball, {{BOWLER}} was talking to Bhuvi as he set the field. Whatever he spoke, he executed to perfection. Inswinger, lands on a length and goes through the bat and pad gap of {{BATSMAN}}. Too big a gap and the ball finds its way through to the stumps. {{BOWLER}} ends with a four-fer. What a story he has been this IPL. The whole of Old City in Hyderabad will be tucking into their biriyanis watching this. Certainly made his folks proud. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shankar!! Another slower delivery. Another wicket. {{BOWLER}} might go for runs but he's a wicket-taker. Angled it across the right hander, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to drive but was into the shot early, sliced it towards backward point where Shankar takes a good catch. SRH pulling things back after that quick start. {{BATSMAN}} c Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 3(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! The googly and {{TEAM}} implode further. The batsman predictably does not read it. Looks to whip a flighted ball outside off and misses it. The ball turned away past the blade and DK does the rest. He whipped the bails off in a flash. {{BOWLER}} leaps up in his celebratory jump. The spinners are choking their opponents here. You have seen this script from KKR. Haven't you?\n",
            "{{BATSMAN}} st Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! Third wicket for {{BOWLER}} in a span of 6 balls. He is having a whale of a time at Kotla. The pitch is tailor-made for his style of bowling and he is making full use of it. It was a slower one on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was taken aback by how slowly it came off the deck. He was way too early on the hoick, it comes off the leading edge and Shardul takes a fine catch near deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 51(47) [4s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Second wicket goes down and Delhi are in trouble early on. Poor shot selection from {{BATSMAN}}. Flashes away from the body with no feet movement to a back of a length delivery outside off and gets a thick outside edge through to Dhoni, who won't drop those. {{BOWLER}} has his hands up in joy. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 3(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Oh Dhoni, thou friggin' beauty. That was at best a mortal throw from the deep mid-wicket fielder and Dhoni has transfigured it into a wicket-taking one. You have to see it to believe it. Turned towards deep square leg by {{BATSMAN}}, Rahane sprinted across and let out a flat throw to his credit, severely threatening the second run there. And then Dhoni takes over. Waited behind the stumps, keeping his hands near the bails and just dislodges them off, like he hates them. Like he loves the red light. {{BATSMAN}} is gone. Never take a second with Dhoni behind the wicket. Never. \"Dhoni, Dhoni\"chants at the stadium. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Rahane/Dhoni) 8(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! Zak attack strikes! Glum faces in the crowd. {{BATSMAN}} falls early in the innings, big wicket for DD. It was on a fuller length around off, it was the off-cutter from Zak. {{BATSMAN}} perhaps went hard at it, the ball seemed to have stopped on the pitch and that must've foiled {{BATSMAN}}'s attempt there. Skewed off the toe-end and lobs a sitter to Samson at mid-off, who backtracks and pouches it safely. So, Zak gets the better of his counterpart. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 10(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! And {{BOWLER}} has his man. The pacer's ego was hurt. And he retorts with a bumper. {{BATSMAN}} is late on it and the ball scooped up for the keeper to take it. Superb bouncer as it was at the body and cramped the batter for room. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 32(15) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Second wicket in the over. What a day {{BOWLER}} is having. Belted by KL, picked his wicket. Smashed around the park by Gayle, sent him back as well and now picks another. The googly which sticks in the surface a tad more than {{BATSMAN}} expected, he is early into the back foot push and lobs a dolly back to {{BOWLER}}. He flings it up and pumps his fist. Boy isn't he delighted. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 0(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! Woah. Screamer from DJ Bravo. This wicket purely belongs to him. Two wickets in two balls for CSK and they are fighting back here. Both set-batsmen back in the hut. {{BOWLER}} went wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} sliced it airly, there was a fielder at deep point. Bravo had to run across to his left, does so and brilliantly gobbles it up. He's a mighty fine fielder, breaks into a jig as well. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Bravo b {{BOWLER}} 51(39) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Morgan!! Has struck a couple of sixes with his sweep shot. This one though goes straight up off the top-edge. It was the one that turned away from {{BATSMAN}} and got him closer to the toe-end, hence the error. Morgan is underneath the skier at square leg. Swirls under it. Eventually has to put in a bit of a dive, but grabs it with both hands. {{BATSMAN}} c Morgan b {{BOWLER}} 26(16) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! {{BOWLER}}'s gotten rid of {{BATSMAN}} in his first over. Prized scalp this for the Australian. Seemed like the off-paced delivery once again. {{BATSMAN}} picked it and went back to mow it over deep mid-wicket. In the process, loses his shape completely and skies it as far as SKY, who settles under it. Throws the ball up in the air, that says a lot of how desperate they were to see the back of Universe Boss. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 50(40) [4s-6 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Appeal and given. {{BOWLER}} wins the Karnataka battle and he's on a hat-trick. {{BATSMAN}} knew he was plumb, didn't bother reviewing. The googly from the bowler, {{BATSMAN}} was lunging forward in his defence, ball hits the pad first and then the bat. Impact in line and it would have crashed into leg at least. Middle and leg according to HawkEye. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Henriques!! That's the end of {{BATSMAN}}, and of {{TEAM}}. The little bit of reverse-swing which {{BOWLER}} uses to curl the ball away from {{BATSMAN}} does his undoing. Despite it being another full toss, {{BATSMAN}} slices it straight up off the outside half of his bat. Simple catch at extra-cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Henriques b {{BOWLER}} 22(17) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Prithvi Shaw Run Out!! Looks like it's a run-out! Just an off-cutter, sliced away off the front-foot towards backward point where Pandya picks up and throws at the non-striker's end. Shaw sees the ball coming, and is still walking towards the crease, assuming that the ball will miss the stumps! Absolutely abominable from Shaw. He wants the ground to swallow him up, does Shaw. Prithvi Shaw run out (Hardik Pandya) 12(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! {{BOWLER}} has the final say. He spots {{BATSMAN}}'s charge early, and yorks him with a quick, wide dart. Animated celebrations from the Mumbai Indians. After the stick he got for most of the over, this was much needed for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} st de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 26(13) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Uthappa Run Out!! Nair has one stump to aim at from point, and he nails it. Uthappa is gone here. He looks surprised as OUT flashes on the big screen. Thought he was in. But he's a yard short at least. Nair is really swift to get onto the ball as {{BATSMAN}} chops it to his left. Quick gather, quick release and a rocket throw. But the magic in the field has come 10 overs too late. Uthappa punches gloves with {{BATSMAN}} as he walks off. Uthappa run out (Nair) 59(33) [4s-5 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Maxwell!! The misery closes. The carnage is over. Looks for another tonk down the ground in looking to finish this off in a hurry. Just that the bat handle rolls in his palms for a change and the ball doesn't get the distance. A miscued slice flies high up and falls into the palms of mid-off. A knock for the centuries nevertheless. {{BATSMAN}} c Maxwell b {{BOWLER}} 77(37) [4s-7 6s-5]\n",
            "Kul{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Gone first ball after the break. Slower and turns away from the advancing {{BATSMAN}}, who still goes through with the insi{{BATSMAN}} out hit, can only lift it up in the air for sweeper to run around to his left and take. A fist pump from Kul{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to celebrate the wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Shubman Gill b Kul{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} 29(27) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Have CSK forgotten to appeal? Didn't appeal for Gayle, he walked. This time a timid appeal for the sake of it from RJ and the umpire raises his finger. A wicket off his first ball for Ravindra {{BOWLER}}. Gave a bit of flight on this ball from round the wicket did RJ and the ball doesn't spin much after pitching outside off. {{BATSMAN}} is down on his knee to swipe and gets a faint edge to the keeper. Off the toe end. That threatened to bobble out of the keeper's hand, but MS doesn't make any mistake. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 35(30) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} has this weakness against legspin. He does have a history of getting out to googlies in the past. Perhaps that could be playing on his mind while playing the wily {{BOWLER}}. Got forward defensively expecting a wrong 'un, but the ball held its line enough before straightening past his outside edge to hammer the off pole. Excellent set up from {{BOWLER}}. A much-needed wicket for SRH and with that, they take the time-out! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 32(26) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! The inside-edge luck runs out. And eventually the inside-edge takes him to his doom. Blame it on his feet refusing to move, yet again. {{BOWLER}} keeps it on a back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} loads up again to flat-bat across the line. Inside-tickle, and no matter how loud Kotla is, the nick is louder. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 14(17) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Boult! GONE! A premature end to the pyrotechnics. A loopy leg-break on a nice length, {{BATSMAN}} is enticed into running down the wicket and lofting over the straight boundary, gets it off the outside half and slices it away towards wide long-off where Boult picks up a catch. Makes some amends for that hat-trick ball. {{BATSMAN}} c Boult b {{BOWLER}} 50(32) [4s-3 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! {{BOWLER}} has turned this game right on its head. First Kohli, and now {{BATSMAN}}. RR should really back themselves from here. Another half-tracker really, but {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get hold of his pull and hits it straight towards long leg. Unadkat seemed to have misjudged it initially, but he's able to make amends by taking an excellent low catch. Wry smile on {{BATSMAN}}'s face. He could have hit this anywhere. Just not his day. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 20(18) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! Trent {{BOWLER}} is such a good operator with the ball. Does have plenty of variations to nip out wickets at will. Bowls it short and creates that uncomfortable angle for {{BATSMAN}} - around middle and off - no room whatsoever. A horrible mistimed shot that, the pull, spoons straight to Prithvi Shaw at mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Prithvi Shaw b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Williamson!! {{BOWLER}} has his man and {{TEAM}} find themselves in further trouble. This was tossed up and held its line just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to play with the turn, closed the bat-face early and pops a leading edge, straight to KW at cover. It's a dolly and the SRH captain doesn't need a second invitation. {{BATSMAN}} c Williamson b {{BOWLER}} 15(10) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Korbo - yes. Lorbo - just there. Jeetbo - iffy, now. This is a death blow, or feels like it. {{BATSMAN}} had the room made, swats at a back of a length delivery and hacks it to deep mid-wicket. And then coaxes de Grandhomme into a second. Is running back to the danger end. Axar darts a throw back to Saha; he's having that kinda day. He's having a field. On the bounce to Saha, who takes the bails off and {{BATSMAN}} is just short. Wow. Just the wicket KXIP needed. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Axar/Saha) 84(52) [4s-8 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} has been cleaned up. Makes room again but the length is much fuller and laced with pace (146kph). {{BATSMAN}}'s bat is late to come down on the inside-out drive, loses his stumps. Big wicket in the context of the game. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Some respite, finally. A yorker that tails in a bit around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} with his back leg deep inside, looking to swing over mid-wicket. Misses due to the dip and is caught plumb in front. Raina walks up to him to congratulate what has been a tremendous ton from one of the modern greats. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 104(60) [4s-8 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by A Russell!! Miscues the googly off the toe-end, and this is a brilliant catch at the edge of the boundary from Andre Russell. He leapt up, grabbed it overhead with both hands, and then landed with his feet just inside the ropes. {{BATSMAN}} is done for this season, a rather disappointing one for him! {{BATSMAN}} c A Russell b {{BOWLER}} 11(10) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chahar!! He's disappointed, disappointed at throwing his wicket away. He has done his job though. Tries to chip the low full toss over mid-off but gets it off the toe end and Chahar at mid-off completes the formalities. Should have waited for the last over, would have made some difference to the end score. {{BATSMAN}} c Chahar b {{BOWLER}} 54(26) [4s-3 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Grandhomme!! Yup, a little too greedy. {{BATSMAN}} tries tonking another, revealing his cards a touch too early as he commits down on a knee. {{BOWLER}} spots, shortens his length a wee bit, letting the ball spin in, which it does to take the eventual top-edge, and CdG isn't messing up the skier, waiting patiently under at short fine leg. {{BATSMAN}} c de Grandhomme b {{BOWLER}} 27(18) [6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! The best batsman in the tournament for {{TEAM}} flops in the final game of the season. Rare failure for PP as {{TEAM}} lose their first wicket. Lenght delivery that gained some extra bounce, {{BATSMAN}} was rooted to the crease and whips his bat across. Thick leading edge is found and it goes up in the air. Local boy Manish Pandey sets himself under it at point and pouches it. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! 0.0.0.0.0 and {{BATSMAN}} - injured forearm and all - can't stay patient any longer. {{BOWLER}} stays quick on a back of a length, but it sticks on the surface as it kicks up, making a real mess of {{BATSMAN}}'s attempted upper-steer to third man. All he gets is a thick feather on the outside edge, straight to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 1(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! It is going from bad to worse for {{TEAM}}, {{BATSMAN}} clips one in the air and finds Rahane to perfection at deep backward square leg. Out for a duck and {{TEAM}} have lost half their side now. A nothing ball from Shardul, leg-stump half-volley, {{BATSMAN}} got inside the line and clipped it firmly - he didn't bother to keep it down and found Rahane to perfection in the deep. He can't believe it as he trudges off. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Moeen Ali!! An away-turning leg-break at 82.4kph, a backing away {{BATSMAN}} had to reach out for it. He was trying to carve it over the covers, but ended up slicing it off the cue end. Moeen Ali settles under it at point and takes a calm catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Moeen Ali b {{BOWLER}} 38(24) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Gopal!! Of course he can. That's {{BOWLER}} at his best. Exploits the weakness of {{BATSMAN}} and sends him packing. Short of length delivery at the ribs, {{BATSMAN}} is not comfortable anything around there, he gets all cramped up as he attempts the pull, it is a tame one and Gopal gobbles up the dolly at mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Gopal b {{BOWLER}} 12(17) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mandeep!! Stunned silence at the Chinnaswamy. They lost three wickets in three overs and are now in big trouble. Clever change of pace, on a length as well, {{BATSMAN}} presses forward and has to check his shot, spoons a sitter to cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Mandeep b {{BOWLER}} 3(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! {{BOWLER}} has deceived the NZ captain with a slower delivery. Off-speed, on a shortish length and just outside off. {{BATSMAN}} arched his back to play a late-upper-cut. He was through with his shot and only managed a faint outside nick. Simple catch for the 'keeper. {{BATSMAN}} tried to pull his bat in, but it was too late. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Yup, the slog was always on the way. {{BOWLER}} knew, oh he surely did, taking pace off his millionth full-cutter tonight. Surely {{BATSMAN}} knew THIS was coming too, but with the RRR touching 20, he had to go for the smash. So he clears his front leg, doesn't really get under the length but still swings, dragging it off the under-edge to a running in long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 11(9) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mohit Sharma!! Double strike in the same over for {{BOWLER}}. This spell might help the Kings to get back in the game. Was a fullish delivery outside off but {{BATSMAN}} got deceived due to the slower one. He reaches for it and ends up slicing it to Mohit Sharma at backward point. Has been the story of the season for {{BATSMAN}}. Has got his eye in and thrown it away more often than not. {{BATSMAN}} c Mohit Sharma b {{BOWLER}} 24(17) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Ishan Kishan Run Out!! Sharp work from {{BOWLER}}! He lets out a roar too. Surely might have been frustrated at the onslaught in the over and although it's not the wicket KXIP wanted, it's definitely potential danger out of the way. Was a good full ball that cramped up {{BATSMAN}} on leg stump. He squeezed it to the left of {{BOWLER}} who was quick to get to the ball and fired a direct hit at the bowler's end. Ishan Kishan was always going to be in trouble if the throw hit and that's what happened. Ishan Kishan run out ({{BOWLER}}) 7(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! End of {{BATSMAN}}. The back of the hand slower delivery, rolling the fingers across the ball, sits up to be smashed, but {{BATSMAN}} can only find long-on with a pull. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 35(23) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! Unadkat is having a dream day in the field - follows up the direct hit with an acrobatic catch at short fine leg. {{TEAM}} are in doldrums now and the move to promote {{BATSMAN}} up the order has failed. This was banged in short and on his body, {{BATSMAN}} was late on the pull, the ball ballooned off the top-edge and lobbed behind the keeper. On another day it could have dropped down in no man's land - but not today. Unadkat moves across to his left, goes with both hands and completes a fine diving catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 4(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! {{BOWLER}} is on fire. Third wicket and all big ones. {{BATSMAN}}'s struggles in IPL continue.. {{TEAM}} in a spot of bother now. The wrong 'un spinning across the left hander, {{BATSMAN}} stays back and has a tentative poke at that, feathers an outside edge and Buttler does the rest behind the wicket. That is 9 wickets in 3 games now for {{BOWLER}} against {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 1(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! And he strikes first-ball! What a catch from {{BOWLER}}! They're checking for a clean catch. Soft signal is OUT. Seemed alright in real time. Okay, the replays are quite confusing. It does seem like a bit of his fingers are under the ball, but also a portion of it seems to be touching the ground. The third umpire isn't sure but he feels there isn't enough evidence to overturn the onfield call. So, {{BATSMAN}} has to walk. Huge, huge wicket this. Was doled out full by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} moved leg-side to drive through the covers. Got it off the inside part of the bat and the ball was travelling to the right of the bowler. {{BOWLER}} stuck his right hand to pouch it. A very fine reflex attempt. {{TEAM}} in disarray here. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 4(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Chopra!! He's mistimed this loft and long-on swallows the ball. This is an area {{BATSMAN}} has to work on. He gets set, looks so good, but throws it away. It's something that will be on his mind. Lovely googly from {{BOWLER}}, gave it a lot of air, {{BATSMAN}} wanted a maximum, but the bat turned in his hands on impact with the ball and the timing was messed. Anyway, such a good innings from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Chopra b {{BOWLER}} 35(15) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Munro!! The DD boys can do nothing wrong tonight. Slog swept and the man at deep backward square leg jumps up and grabs it with the tip of his fingers. Superb take at the boundary line. That was hit flat and well but the fielder did well to keep his balance at the fence and grab it. In the end, the momentum on the shot almost meant the ball would explode through his fingers but it did not. {{BATSMAN}} c Munro b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Livingstone!! Brave. He might have been smashed for a six, but now with nothing to lose - except this match which is alrady lost - {{BOWLER}} tosses his googly up. {{BATSMAN}} charges down, doesn't really get close enough but still goes through with the hoick. Ends up with a massive miscues to long-on, where Livingstone runs in to, and then adjusts really well to the ball dipping behind him. {{BATSMAN}} c Livingstone b {{BOWLER}} 11(6) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Avesh Khan!! Excellent catch! It's the young man Avesh Khan, you cannot keep him out of the action and this is a massive wicket for DD. The dangerous {{BATSMAN}} needs to depart. Clever from {{BOWLER}}, the slower ball on a shorter length and I don't think that {{BATSMAN}} picked this variation. Went across on the back foot for the short arm jab but got no pace to work with at all. Mistimed it badly and Avesh at short fine leg judged it brilliantly with a dive forward. Plucked it inches above the ground. Brilliant! {{BATSMAN}} c Avesh Khan b {{BOWLER}} 23(15) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleans him up! Excellent yorker from {{BOWLER}} and that's the end of {{BATSMAN}}. This was on the base of off stump and although the southpaw could see it coming, he was beaten for pace. Ended up just brushing the off bails. Fantastic comeback from RR, they are dragging things back in spectacular fashion here. {{BOWLER}} was unlucky not to get Williamson earlier with a yorker and was even unfortunate that a catch was put down as well of the Kiwi. Not this time. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Warner!! That will hurt. {{TEAM}} needed {{BATSMAN}} to fire, he does not. Makes room to this short ball and for some odd reason does not go full throttle with the cut. The ball might have held a bit on the pitch, mistimed to the right of Warner at extra cover. Good running catch from the centurion. {{BATSMAN}} c Warner b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Jaffa. Peach. Ripper. Call it whatever. This was unplayable, indeed. Pitched on off and snakes away a tad to beat {{BATSMAN}} defence. Hits the top of off and {{BATSMAN}} is a dead duck. {{BOWLER}} is on a hat-trick and he can might well get it. It's Harbhajan Singh who walks out to bat ahead of Dhoni, Bravo and Jadeja. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kuldeep Yadav!! And the move works. {{BATSMAN}} has again thrown it away and failed to finish. Not what {{TEAM}} wanted. Not what Ponting wanted either and not what he himself wanted ahead of the WC selection. All these little things matter. Fantastic knock but he has thrown it away at the brink of it. 17 still needed. Was loopy ball, {{BATSMAN}} charged out, threw his weight behind the shot with one hand off and the ball landed straight into the hands of the man at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Kuldeep Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 46(31) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! And {{BOWLER}} exults. He has got his first IPL wicket and that is {{BATSMAN}}. He would want to cherish this amidst the gloom surrounding KKR. The KKR camp can hardly celebrate. Slower delivery at the sticks, {{BATSMAN}} was through with his slog a little too early and the wickets were disturbed. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 67(38) [4s-3 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! Half the side back in the hut. RR are back in this!! A nothing shot from {{BATSMAN}}, sits back and looks to loft-drive {{BOWLER}} over cover, but he hadn't quite read the pace on this. It did stop a tad and he ended up spooning it towards cover where Jinks dives full length to grab it cleanly. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 7(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! What a jaffa! {{BOWLER}} is on a hat-trick. {{BATSMAN}} had no clue about this, stands there in disbelief just like Stokes did earlier when that catch was taken. This pitched on off and came back sharply to go through {{BATSMAN}}'s defence. Takes down the middle stump and Royals are in danger of getting bowled out well within the 20 overs. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! Killer blow! Shardul Thakur has made a tough catch look very simple. {{BATSMAN}}'s cameo comes to an end and DC have lost an important wicket. Length delivery, straighter at the stumps and jerked his lower body, unfurling a whippy-pull uppishly towards deep square leg. Thakur ran swiftly to his right, cushions it neatly and slides before completing the catch. They have also called for a time-out. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 25(13) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! Raining wickets for Kolkata. Two in two for Krishna and he becomes the second player from Karnataka to take four wickets so far today, informs my colleague Varun Dixit. Banged in short just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slogs across the line and gets a thick top-edge that goes high in the air. Skipper takes the matter in his own hands and backtracks, keeps his eyes on the ball and nestles it safely in his glove. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} steps across the stumps, swipes across the line and misses. Given out leg-before. But is this slanting down leg? That's what he's hoping for while going for the review. But as is the case, the ball's just clipping the side of leg-stump to make it stay with the onfield call. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 31(26) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Rahul Tewatia!! In the air and taken. Mumbai crumbling as they lose half their side. Phew! Look out for {{BOWLER}}, he's off for a celebratory run. Googly again, in the driving spot. {{BATSMAN}} went for it and spooned it uppishly to cover. The sub fielder Tewatia, does a fine job. Sprawls across and pouches it safely. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Rahul Tewatia b {{BOWLER}} 4(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by K Paul! He's gone! This is the very definition of disappointment - from the crowd AND from the {{TEAM}} dug-out. A short one, with the pace off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the signature six to finish with a pull towards cow corner where he picks out Keemo Paul. You can hear a pin drop at Vizag. {{BATSMAN}} c K Paul b {{BOWLER}} 9(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! A scratchy innings from {{BATSMAN}} comes to an end. But it was an important innings. It was a slower one on a length, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to clobber it to the on-side. He swings it down the wrong line, it clips the outside half of the bat and was in the air for a long time. Jadeja at long-on comes under it and takes it with utmost ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 42(32) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Cummins!! Much needed wicket for KKR? I ask that because it brings more dangerous batsmen out to the middle. This was sort of a knuckle ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} made room to go over extra cover but was deceived for the lack of pace, hit it much straighter than he would have liked and Cummins settles under it near long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Cummins b {{BOWLER}} 21(13) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! {{BOWLER}} bags his third wicket! {{BATSMAN}} looks to go big against the pacer and slogs it straight to the man at deep mid-wicket. Tewatia is everywhere in the field. A wicket, couple of catches. Good game for him so far. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Tewatia b {{BOWLER}} 16(15) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has ripped the stumps apart. Dishes out a sizzling full length delivery and it was the pace that got the better of him. {{BATSMAN}} swung hard but there was daylight between his willow and the ball - end result is that the sticks are rattled and it's game over for {{BATSMAN}}, at least with the bat. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 20(10) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Amit {{BOWLER}} breaks the 64-run stand. He conceded just 2 runs in his opening over, should have scalped Nitish Rana too. Nevertheless, he has nipped out {{BATSMAN}}. A floaty leg-break, spins away a bit, {{BATSMAN}} gets down to slog-sweep and only manages a top edge. Went a long way up in the air and Pant moves towards the square leg region to pouch it. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 28(22) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stoinis!! Second wicket for KXIP in the powerplay. Not many times they have achieved that this season. It is a big one of {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} saw the batsman back away to the leg-side, fired it full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was made to reach, was down on his back knee to drive, couldn't control it and spooned it towards extra cover. Stoinis right on the edge of the circle, dives forward and takes it millimeters from the ground. {{BATSMAN}} c Stoinis b {{BOWLER}} 13(12) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nair!! Straight down the gullet of Nair. The time-out has broken {{BATSMAN}}'s concentration. Was looking so good and has thrown it away. Flat and shorter from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} rocked back and hammered it off the sweet spot. Hit it flat and didn't have enough wings to clear the ropes. Nair didn't have to move an inch at deep mid-wicket as he cupped it. Eden Gardens has been muted. The half-trackers working well for the spinners throughout this tournament so far. {{BATSMAN}} c Nair b {{BOWLER}} 34(23) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Much-needed wicket for SRH. Never looked close to the naked eye, but technology - as ever - always finds a way to surprise us. That quick release off the wrists from {{BOWLER}}, that canny variations off the front of the hand... {{BATSMAN}} unfortuantely didn't read it well. Was playing for the ball spinning into him and was a tad late in bringing his bat down. The ball zoomed back in at a rapid pace to catch him close for a lbw call. Not a confident appeal, but SRH make full use of the DRS system. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 24(20) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! {{BOWLER}} has his man! It's the slower ball off the back of the hand, wide outside off at 110.8kph, {{BATSMAN}} chases it for a cut and gets a thick top edge. Kishan dives to his right at short third man and completes the formalities. The fielder is pumped up, I'm sure the entire MI set-up is. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 60(44) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by M Pandey!! Gone! {{BOWLER}} gets his man. After bowling a slower bouncer, {{BOWLER}} opts for the quicker one this time. {{BATSMAN}} is slightly late on his pull as he is hurried by the pace. Gets it off the top portion of the bat. Pandey at deep square leg, settles under it and takes it calmly. {{BATSMAN}} c M Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 31(15) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Buttler Run Out!! Suicidal running between the wickets. Buttler walks off the field shaking his head. That should have been his response to {{BATSMAN}} after the stroke was completed. It was a half-tracker outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in his crease and cuts it to the left of point. Faulkner dives to his left to stop that. Gets up quickly and hits the target direct at the striker's end. Buttler was OUT by a mile. Buttler run out (Faulkner) 9(7) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Oh, what happened there? {{TEAM}} have gifted a wicket away to the visitors. Hare-brained running from the duo. Complete break in communication results in a run-out. Flatter outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went back and laced the cut to backward point. {{BATSMAN}} set off without even looking at his partner. Lynn wasn't interested and sends him back. Both were ball-watching and {{BATSMAN}} had no chance of returning there. Rajpoot gathers it and fires a neat throw to the keeper, who does the rest. {{BATSMAN}}, the man in form for {{TEAM}} has to depart. Punjab clawing back here. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Rajpoot/Rahul) 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Christian!! That's curtains. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't believe in knocking the ball around and playing out his quota of overs. Apparently. Buries down with a stoop looking to slog it out of the park. Done in the flight and the agricultural hoick manages only a miscue off the under edge to tonk high in the air. Only towards extra cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Christian b {{BOWLER}} 6(12)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stoinis!! Ravichandran {{BOWLER}} gets the man in form. An off-break by {{BOWLER}}, that was bowled a lot slower through the air. {{BATSMAN}} swings his bat and gets it off the cue end as Stoinis takes a comfortable catch at deep mid-wicket. The pressure of big scores, he's yet to deal with that, is {{BATSMAN}}. Even against Punjab when {{TEAM}} were set a big target, {{BATSMAN}} failed to get going. Same is the case today. {{BATSMAN}} c Stoinis b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} ends his spell with a wicket. Pitches this one on a tad fuller length and bowls a quicker legbreak, {{BATSMAN}} with lack of footwork tries to punch it, can't get any connection however. The ball knocks the top of off stump and {{BATSMAN}} is gone! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hooda!! It's getting worse and worse for {{TEAM}}. {{BOWLER}} is having a dream spell as he picks up his fourth wicket. {{BATSMAN}} had a chance to prove his mettle but he just miscues one into the hands of long-on. Nothing shot really and the nightmare continues for the visitors. It was flighted just outside off and kind of held up on the pitch, {{BATSMAN}} was deluded by the flight as he went after it and could only succeed in finding Hooda. {{BATSMAN}} c Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 5(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! Oh no! {{BATSMAN}} has nailed this but straight to the fielder. {{BOWLER}}'s golden arm strikes again. Big call to trust him with this over after Saini had gone for a few, but {{BATSMAN}} has just thrown it away. Charges down, converts it into an overpitched delivery and drills it straight to AB at mid-off. The idea was to place it wide of the fielder like he done to Umesh but {{BATSMAN}} was not able to do that. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 17(18) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Piyush {{BOWLER}} becomes the third bowler in the history of IPL to claim 150 wickets. Calls for the catch, sprints back and takes it eventually. Was another googly and {{BATSMAN}} got a top-edge as he tried to slog it across the line. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 24(18) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, {{BATSMAN}} tried to slog-sweep the googly and missed, luckily the ball pitched outside leg stump. Mumbai needlessly reviewed, only to lose. QdK was blinded by the batsman, so he couldn't tell the full story\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Number one down. A premature end to {{BATSMAN}}'s innings. {{BOWLER}} is chuffed to bits, lets out a huge roar. It was full and straight, the back of the hand slower ball from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} misjudged it completely. Shuffled across his sticks and plays down the wrong line. Misses it and is struck low on the pad. Looked pretty adjacent and umpire Anil Chaudhary raises his dreaded finger. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 34(21) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! Another bites the dust. And {{BATSMAN}} is gutted with himself, absolutely gutted. He smashes the bat in air after he edged it. Oh these young players! It was a normal leggie wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} plays a nothing shot. He wanted to steer it wide of slips, ends up playing too fine and hands a simple catch to Watson at slip. Half of the team is back in the hut now. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! {{BATSMAN}} gets his younger brother. Length delivery curling away, {{BATSMAN}} looks to go down town and slices the ball away to mid-off. Simple catch for the fielder who accepts it with ease. Pollard couldn't crossover either. {{TEAM}} being dented here. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BATSMAN}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Oh my, what do we have here! {{BOWLER}} has ripped the game open once more with two in two. Pacy full ball outside off, the punchy fellow that {{BATSMAN}} is, he goes for an ambitious cover drive but can only nick it to the keeper. Hat-trick ball coming up. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} gets his yorker right and {{BATSMAN}}'s stumps go for a walk. This was fast, this was full and this was on the middle-stump line. {{BATSMAN}} backs away on the drive, misses and simply walks back to the pavilion. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 10(8) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Thank the lights {{BOWLER}}, it's successfully broken {{BATSMAN}}'s momentum. A slower leg-break by his standards and {{BATSMAN}} tries to carefully nurdle it away after plonking his front leg in front of middle. But no, loses his timing, misses all ends up and the umpire is convinced enough. {{BATSMAN}}'s convinced to walk off as well, but the ball's striking him in front of leg, could it have spun down? {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 68(47) [4s-8 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That word of advice from MSD after two shockers from {{BOWLER}} has made a massive difference. And he has probably won the match for CSK. It was a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swings and misses and it smashes the stumps. The leg-stump goes for a toss. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! Advances down looking to go all the way, but {{BOWLER}} hasn't allowed him to get to the pitch. As a result, there's some room for the ball to turn, which is enough to take the outside half of the bat. Goes straight up and MI couldn't have asked for anyone better than Pollard to get underneath. Desperately needed this wicket, the visitors. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 35(19) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Williamson!! Fine catch! {{BOWLER}} picks up his third wicket. He's been the pick of the bowlers along with Rashid. Change of pace and {{BATSMAN}} went after it, cleared his front leg and swung as hard as possible, came off the toe-end and went straight up, Williamson ran across from extra cover and took it near mid-off. It was in the air for a long time and the skipper had to put in a dive to take it. {{BATSMAN}} c Williamson b {{BOWLER}} 79(56) [4s-4 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! And that's why he was brought back. Huge moment in the game. Third wicket for RPS and all three have been from {{BOWLER}}. Nothing special about this delivery. Short and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was on the hop trying to play the cut, does not bother to keep it down and picks out the sweeper to perfection. He was aiming to go over point and got it a lot squarer than he would have liked. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 40(34) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik! What a {{BATSMAN}}perately fantastic catch that is! A short one at the body, {{BATSMAN}} isn't second-time lucky with a top-edged hook, skies it towards fine leg, looks, for an eternity, like it will land in no man's land, but Karthik, the stubborn Karthik, chases it down from the 'keeper's stop and dives full-stretch to take a magnificent catch. It's that kind of inspirational moment by the skipper, the kind of fairytale moment, that can turn a match, or even a tournament, on its head. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 30(23) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! The bridge is falling. The fortess is falling in dramatic fashion. {{BATSMAN}} gets himself a golden duck on his home debut. Fizz comes up with his go-to ball - a cutter slanting across. {{BATSMAN}} with flat feet looks to drive away from his body, gets the customary edge and Ishan's diving low to his right to collect. Yes his black eye doesn't stop him from judging these perfectly. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Suryakumar Yadav Run Out!! 1 run completed. Yadav knew too. He put in the desperate dive but stayed down as he knew he had not made it in. {{BATSMAN}} steps out and is met by a back of a length delivery, he nudges it into the empty mid-wicket pocket and calls for the second, {{BOWLER}} chases after it and throws it to the bowler's end, Morgan gathers the ball and lights up the stumps. Even with a full length dive Yadav was six inches short. Suryakumar Yadav run out ({{BOWLER}}/Morgan) 47(28) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chahar!! That is the end of the {{BATSMAN}} show - he's furious with himself as he walks back. Would have been a wide had he let it go - but the adrenaline was pumping and he couldn't hold back - went chasing after that and lifted it towards deep cover - Chahar ran in, took it awkwardly around his chest, reverse cupped - it threatened to pop out, but he manages to clutch it safely. Was the slower short ball and {{BATSMAN}} didn't have the pace on the shot. Some relief for the CSKians, they clearly looked rattled. {{BATSMAN}} c Chahar b {{BOWLER}} 74(32) [4s-1 6s-9]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Dreadful from {{BATSMAN}}. Looks to swipe a top of middle ball to leg and misses. No conviction nor was it a high percentage shot. The ball doesn't do anything except follow its straight line path and clatters into the top of off and middle. Very poor from such an experienced campaigner. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} is livid, yells out all the frustration after he missed the shot. Looks to charge at the bowler and exposes his cards way too early in the process, Bhajji fires it in quickly to defeat {{BATSMAN}}'s bat swing and hit the middle of middle. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(7) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Negi Run Out!! 1 run completed. Madness from {{TEAM}} and they have lost three in three. Team hat-trick. Lofted by {{BATSMAN}} without any power, to the right of long-off. Negi wanted to come back for the second, but is sent back and can't beat the accurate throw on the bounce to MS. Flat and rocket-like by Jadeja. Negi isn't happy and is seen chuntering away in the dug-out. Negi run out (Jadeja/Dhoni) 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Finch!! A breezy innings comes to an end. One shot too many from {{BATSMAN}}. Should have tried to bat a bit longer, especially with Smith at the other end. Full delivery on off, {{BATSMAN}} makes a bit of room and lofts it to mid-off. The idea was to go over the fielder, but with the ball being too close to his bat, he did not get the elevation. Finch reverse cups it right on the edge of the circle. {{BATSMAN}} c Finch b {{BOWLER}} 33(17) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! A poor dismissal for the Capitals and {{BATSMAN}} walks back for a duck. He might have actually been reprieved first up, think he gloved the pull and KL spilled it - the ball rolled wide of him and {{BATSMAN}} thought there was a single on offer - dashed way down the track only to watch his partner motionless at the other end. Too late to return, KL ran across, collected the ball and lobbed in a throw at the striker's end - Gowtham was waiting for it and breaks the stumps, with a disconsolate {{BATSMAN}} stranded in the middle. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Rahul/Gowtham ) 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! That's a crucial wicket. {{BATSMAN}}'s found long-off, where SKY takes the catch and has a pratfall. Just lost his balance a bit and slipped backwards. Was a front footed power-punch but there's not enough wattage in the shot. So much for being a touch player. And here's {{BOWLER}} picking a wicket just when you least expect him to. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 37(36) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Smith!! Another wicket to the break. And all {{BATSMAN}} needed to lose his concentration were the 150 seconds. Sees a toss up delivery and compulsively swings his bat looking to downtown with his lofted drives. Enough turn away to take the miscue. Meanwhile Smith sprints from long-off, and juggles before pouching. {{BOWLER}} too is off on a celebratory run. {{BATSMAN}} c Smith b {{BOWLER}} 9(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Andrew Tye!! {{BOWLER}} has his revenge! Must say this was an ugly stroke from {{BATSMAN}}, lost his shape completely on the slog after using his feet. It was looped up nicely and was the one that spun across him, too much to do for the southpaw and all he managed to do was slice it high towards extra cover. What about the catch though? Tye had to backtrack with his back to the ball but judged it beautifully and timed the slide really well. Massive wicket for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} was looking deadly. {{BATSMAN}} c Andrew Tye b {{BOWLER}} 28(13) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! Another one down. What are you doing Mumbai? From 86/0 they have slipped to 119/4. Slower short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} didn't have the required room to free his arms on the pull shot, miscues it towards deep mid-wicket. Samson almost overran it, but then leaped back and took it reverse cup. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 12(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The corker yorker has got the leg pole cartwheeling here. Looked to open the face of the bat on that yorkerish delivery but missed it and the leg-stick went for a toss. {{TEAM}} are crumbling too quickly here. Perfect yorker and the perfect result as well. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! Mistimed and picks out extra cover. {{BATSMAN}} has been done in for pace here, it's a low full toss but quite brisk and hence, isn't able to connect properly. Ends up cue-ending the shot towards the off-side where the RR skipper takes a tumbling catch, diving forward. This is a fine passage of play for the visitors. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 5(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Has {{BATSMAN}} been stumped? de Kock certainly seems confident. It's a fair delivery, the bat is in the air, {{BATSMAN}} is way short as well and he's OUT. That's the end of a mighty fine cameo from the KXIP captain, will it be the clinching factor in this match? Smart bowling from {{BOWLER}}, sensed that {{BATSMAN}} was coming down the track, threw in a loopy leg-break, {{BATSMAN}} came down the track, doesn't get anywhere near the ball, swung across the line in hope and missed, de Kock did the rest. {{BATSMAN}} st de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 33(21) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Warner!! Good lord, that's got air miles on it. Way up into the night sky, Warner settles under it at long-on and takes it. {{BOWLER}} had slowed the pace down on the delivery, causing {{BATSMAN}} to go through with the hoick too early. Right off the toe-end of the bat. {{BATSMAN}} c Warner b {{BOWLER}} 6(3) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ashwin!! A wicket against run of play and {{BOWLER}} nets the big fish. {{BATSMAN}} gone. The wheels are coming off for Rajasthan Royals. {{BOWLER}} hurls a low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the across-the-line swipe and loses his shape completely. Skews it off the bottom to extra cover. Skipper Ash swallows it up. {{BOWLER}} is chuffed to bits. {{BATSMAN}} c Ashwin b {{BOWLER}} 14(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Top nut to end the innings. Yorker aimed right at the base of off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} jams it back to the bowler and Mohit was going for the run as it was the last ball of the innings, {{BATSMAN}} responds but always knew he would not make it. {{BOWLER}} collects the ball, runs back and takes the bails off. {{BATSMAN}} run out ({{BOWLER}}) 10(5) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! {{BOWLER}} gets rid of both the openers in successive overs. {{BATSMAN}} walks down the wicket to play the flatter delivery and gets outfoxed. Comes off an inside edge, rolls back off the pad towards Dhoni who had to lunge forward to get the ball and stretch to break the bails. No chance of getting back in and that's the end of an impressive innings by the Capitals' opener. Can CSK get a few more wickets and stem the flow of runs? {{BATSMAN}} st Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 64(43) [4s-9 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Naman Ojha!! The umpire spots an edge. And is happy to raise the finger. Sorry, not quite the time to be mean. {{BOWLER}} bends his back in banging it short, and cramps {{BATSMAN}} all ends up for any room. Despite the shuffle coming in, the swivelling pull only gets the ping on the glove to a diving Ojha to his left. {{BATSMAN}} c Naman Ojha b {{BOWLER}} 4(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! Superb catch from Raina at first slip. Moved swiftly to his left and catches it above his head. A nothing shot from {{BATSMAN}}. He knew that the ball is swinging, still flirts with a ball outside off sans any feet movement. Short of good length and nipping away from the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} gets squared up and can only manage an outside edge that finds the safe palms of Raina. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 4(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! The pitch-grip does its bit. And add to it {{BATSMAN}}'s attempt to go a little too powerfully at this. It was short, innocuous-looking, and then it sticks in the surface, making {{BATSMAN}} lose all shape as he commits to his slap -- eventually dragging it tamely to extra cover, where life gives Iyer a second chance, and he doesn't mess it up. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 16(21) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} has been given OUT LBW and he wants a review. This looked adjacent to the naked eye. It's a fair delivery and there's no bat as well. The impact seems to be in front of middle, the height isn't an issue. No edge, says Ultraedge. Hawk-Eye in, three reds and {{BATSMAN}} is OUT. Simple call for umpire Ravi and {{BOWLER}} has struck with his last ball. This was full and came back with the angle, {{BATSMAN}} shuffled a long way across on the flick, once he missed, it was curtains, decided to take a chance as he reviewed, but to no avail. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! KL Rahul is such a brilliant fielder and boy, he makes catching look so easy. A pacy short ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}}'s so tall that he could actually stay flat-feeted and swipe at it with full throttle, hit that real hard but flat it went to the right of long-on. KL Rahul sprints across and controls the slide before tumbling over to complete the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hetmyer! The agony! It was a full-toss, just a moment too less for Mayank to process this, flays this on account of the width, trying to slice this over deep backward point for six, but ends up finding the ONE fielder at the boundary - Hetmyer. Screams at the heavens for snatching this moment away from him, but he has only himself to blame, does Mayank. Just hasn't managed to finish this off! {{BATSMAN}} c Hetmyer b {{BOWLER}} 89(60) [4s-7 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shankar!! {{BATSMAN}} has found the fielder there. And he is furious with himself. Look at the anger on his face. It means a lot to these players. Kohli appreciates the effort from the balcony. It was well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to lift it over long-off. It wasn't timed as well as compared to his previous shots. And Vijay Shankar takes a brilliant catch at long-off. He knew exactly where the ropes were and made sure he didn't touch it. {{BATSMAN}} c Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 75(47) [4s-4 6s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Boult!! It is the Maxwell-Boult partnership again. Seemed like a replay of the Pollard dismissal. The duo even have a laugh together. This was much more easily done by Maxwell. The third umpire has a check and there's nothing to overturn the soft signal. Another failure for {{BATSMAN}}. He's had a terrible season. More importantly leaves his team in a spot of bother. The slower off-cutter grips the surface and deceives {{BATSMAN}} compeletly, he was into the shot early and went through with it, the bottom hand comes off and the ball skies towards long-on, Maxwell runs across and takes the catch, but with the momentum taking him out, he lobs the ball to Boult, who came running from long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Boult b {{BOWLER}} 13(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Maxwell!! Shovels it to his doom. Only after having done his job to perfection. {{BOWLER}} gets the yorker right and {{BATSMAN}} gets his bat down off a massive backlift in shovelling it out. Not quite the elevation this time with the ball flying down to long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Maxwell b {{BOWLER}} 17(8) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! That's a sliding specky from AB. Makes up for the catch he dropped earlier. {{BATSMAN}} went for his go-to shot - agricultural slog - and couldn't quite manage it off the middle. Flew off the bottom hand to the left of long-on where AB covered great distance to slide and gobble it before tripping over with a tumble. All of that inches inside the rope. It certainly needed some brilliance to end {{BATSMAN}}'s blitzkrieg. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 61(34) [4s-5 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Southee!! The dangerous {{BATSMAN}} falls. He's lured into the big shot due to the flight, but gets it right off the toe-end. Had to reach out for the loft, as the line was wide from {{BOWLER}}. It's very smartly bowled actually. The ball grips away further to take the bottom of the bat. Southee hangs on at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Southee b {{BOWLER}} 36(21) [4s-3 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! MS has a chat with the bowler and decides to review .. in the nick of time. {{BATSMAN}} shuffled across and missed the flick. A fair delivery. Clearly no bat. The impact is on middle and ball-tracking shows it to be hitting leg! Bruce Oxenford has overturned his original decision. The bowler had a lengthy chat with skipper and a jovial-looking MS Dhoni signalled 'T' only at the last second. Turned out to be the correct move. A fuller-than-a-good-length ball and {{BATSMAN}} had walked across a long way to work it square on the leg-side. Three reds on HawkEye! {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 14(11) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Krunal has plucked it out of thin air. This might be a blessing in disguise for {{TEAM}}. They need Russell out in the middle. {{BATSMAN}} and Uthappa were going nowhere with this innings. Full and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} whipped it cleanly and thought he had got it over the man at mid-wicket, but Krunal uses his height and times his jump to perfection to catch it with both hands. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 3(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! 'Phenomenal catch', says Matthew Hayden on air. That's a catch that might well tilt this final towards {{TEAM}}. {{BOWLER}} is having a ball at the moment, this was another slower ball, he rolled his fingers across the seam. {{BATSMAN}} was looking to nudge it towards the on-side, was through with the shot even before it arrived, gets a thick leading edge that popped back towards the bowler. {{BOWLER}} was on his followthrough, pushes his left hand across - it was dropping down on him, he bends down really low and completes a fine one-handed catch. The momentum was always going across him, but he held on - even as his elbow hit the ground. Mobbed by his mates, rightly so. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 3(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! The pressure got to him! Kept running out of partners and now, decides to throw the kitchen sink against the wily old customer. Bhajji sees him coming down the wicket and aims wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} had to fetch while not getting close to the pitch of the delivery, goes through with the loft and only succeeds in offering a dolly to KP, at long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 48(35) [4s-6 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out W Saha Run Out!! 1 run completed. Better length from {{BOWLER}}, full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} batters it to long-off. Saha decides to come back for the second, but {{BATSMAN}} is unmoved. The former spots it only after coming halfway down the pitch. Cummins fires a good throw to the keeper's end and Karthik completes the proceedings. Easy call for the TV umpire. W Saha run out (Cummins/Karthik) 30(31) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Rajasthan review against {{BATSMAN}}! Looks very close but might probably be umpire's call. In fact, it's out. Pitching in line, impact in line and it's hitting the leg-stump. Terrific yorker by {{BOWLER}} as {{BATSMAN}} couldn't connect his flick. The ball struck the sole of his shoe and replays confirm that he's a dead duck. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 23(15) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by McClenaghan!! {{BATSMAN}} combusts. The ploy of bringing in a spinner early in the innings has paid rich dividends for Mumbai. {{BATSMAN}}, in an attempt to go big, miscues one and hits it straight to square leg. McClenaghan times his jump to perfection, leaps and takes a smart catch. {{BOWLER}} exults in delight.{{BATSMAN}} c McClenaghan b {{BOWLER}} 19(13) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! An anti-climax to end the innings. A yorker outside off that's too quick for {{BATSMAN}} to squeeze it out. They try to steal a bye but the keeper parries the ball to {{BOWLER}} who does the rest. {{TEAM}} end on a competitive score, nevertheless. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Parthiv Patel/{{BOWLER}}) 14(5) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleans him up, right through everything. It's that pre-covid-Starc dismissal -- which Quinton's looking to whip against the outswing. Clearly he's in no position to connect, but {{BOWLER}}'s perfectly in position and pose in his salute. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mandeep!! The night has changed completely for the 27-year old RCB debutant. {{BATSMAN}} has been dismissed for less than fifty for the first time against RCB - when he's playing for {{TEAM}}. On a good length and well outside off, it was there to be smacked, {{BATSMAN}} didn't go through with the shot completely, he was just looking to clear the infield. Mandeep times his jump to perfection at point and completes a good two-handed catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Mandeep b {{BOWLER}} 14(8) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ashwin!! Big wicket! It is not swing but spin that breaks this dangerous pair. The carrom ball drifts in and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to clip it off the pads, he does not keep it down the ground and Ashwin at mid-wicket takes a good low catch. He dived forward and scooped it inches off the ground. {{BATSMAN}} c Ashwin b {{BOWLER}} 1(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} gets the first breakthrough for KKR. Eden has found it's voice back. It was pitched in that brilliant area around off and on a fuller length, it straightened after hitting the deck. {{BATSMAN}} plays down the wrong line. It pinned him on the pads and looked plumb. {{BATSMAN}} did well not to waste a review for it. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 34(21) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Milind Kumar!! Yikes! That was an ugly hit with no real intent from {{BATSMAN}}. Ugly because his front foot was pointing towards cover and when you do that, there's no way you can flick the ball with control. Just a chip in the end to this back of a length delivery and deep mid-wicket ran forward to take the catch. In fact he caught that with one hand despite going with both hands. Crowd cheers as they see Pollard walk out. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Milind Kumar b {{BOWLER}} 11(21) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Shorey! GONE! That's a key wicket! The leg-break, very full, {{BATSMAN}} charges down the track, feeling the p{{TEAM}}Ressure, and takes it on the full - tries lofting it straight into the sightscreen, but literally plays right into the hands of Shorey at the long-off boundary. {{BOWLER}} is thrilled to bits. He knows how important this wicket is. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Shorey b {{BOWLER}} 28(30) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Cutting!! The cameras rightly pan to Hardik Pandya, who was furious when {{BOWLER}} had dropped {{BATSMAN}} on four. Redemption for the young leggie here. First ball to {{BATSMAN}} in this new spell and he's taken him out with a leg break. Got it to spin, which meant that {{BATSMAN}}, on his front foot and going for the big hit, had to slice it. Carries nice and high to long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Cutting b {{BOWLER}} 54(35) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik {{BOWLER}}!! Now finds deep mid-wicket. A drag down and somehow {{BATSMAN}} has contrived to find the man. Another soft, soft dismissal. Could've and should've hit it to the stands, but walks away gifting his wicket. {{BOWLER}} gets a wicket off a delivery which wasn't great by any means. But he won't be complaining. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 12(15) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Andrew Tye!! {{BOWLER}} has his revenge! Must say this was an ugly stroke from {{BATSMAN}}, lost his shape completely on the slog after using his feet. It was looped up nicely and was the one that spun across him, too much to do for the southpaw and all he managed to do was slice it high towards extra cover. What about the catch though? Tye had to backtrack with his back to the ball but judged it beautifully and timed the slide really well. Massive wicket for KXIP. {{BATSMAN}} was looking deadly. {{BATSMAN}} c Andrew Tye b {{BOWLER}} 28(13) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shankar!! {{BATSMAN}}' patchy form continues, he was looking clueless and ends up gifting his wicket to {{BOWLER}} here. Mumbai have lost two wickets in two overs, slightly under the pump now. Very well bowled by {{BOWLER}}, didn't offer any pace and kept it slower. {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knees and attempts an ugly mow across the line. The timing goes haywire and he hits it towards deep mid-wicket. Vijay Shankar swiftly moves across and grabs it. {{BATSMAN}} c Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 1(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Another chance, and this time there's no mistake. But it's {{BATSMAN}}, and not Kohli. Not too dissimilar from that Kohli chance actually. It's a bit short, a bit wide, {{BATSMAN}} has a swish at it but he's done in by extra bounce. Simple catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gambhir!! Nathan {{BOWLER}} continues to pick wickets. DK reveals his cards a touch too early, seeks to flick into the on-side and sends a leading edge into the off-side. Gambhir lurking at cover anticipates and takes a good catch diving to his left. The ball popped up off his palm, but he hung onto it while falling parallel to the ground. {{BATSMAN}} c Gambhir b {{BOWLER}} 3(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} chops on! He attempts to cut this ball away from close to off stump but never has enough room to do so, despite his effort of stepping into the leg-side. The length isn't all that short either. Been up and down the order in this tournament, and this duck will only add to the pressure. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! This was always coming. {{BATSMAN}} never looked in tonight. Struggled a tad initially and throws his wicket away eventually. It's a slower delivery, shortish in length too. The big man goes after it with a single handed shot and gets no sort of connection. Miscues it over mid-off where de Villiers sprints to his left and gulps it down. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 5(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! He walks! Some respite for {{BOWLER}}, who has taken a beating in this over. This would have been a wide had {{BATSMAN}} let go but instead he goes chasing after it. The leg-break trying to keep it away from the batsman's range, but DK reaches out and feathers an outside edge to Pant. He does not even wait for the umpire to raise his finger. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 50(36) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Off the base of the bat and caught by Surya at deep mid. {{BATSMAN}} is unhappy at himself, screams and then taps the bat onto the helmet in despair. Was a slower delivery and in the slot for the mow over deep mid, but miscued it to the man. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 14(10) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! Third catch for Hooda after the drop. The ball is full and angling across off, {{BATSMAN}} slices it in the air after throwing his bat at it. Simple catch at sweeper cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Deepak Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Negi!! This was coming. All Kohli needed to do was have a man at sweeper cover. It's very difficult for a right-handed batsman to middle the ball against the away-going ball from a left-handed bowler on a slowish pitch when he is trying to loft on the off-side. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to go over mid-off, but lack of pace on the ball meant the bat turned in his hands on impact with the ball. Ended up slicing it and it's a simple grab for Negi. Credit to {{BOWLER}} for bowling the slower ball. This is a very sluggish start from {{TEAM}}. 18/2 and we are into the fourth over. {{BATSMAN}} c Negi b {{BOWLER}} 9(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Spins in and traps {{BATSMAN}} on the crease. Up goes the finger. The ball was spinning sharply, which probably prompted the review, but it wasn't enough to save him as it would've clipped the top of leg stump. Delhi go from 52/1 to 66/4. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chahal!! This is just the start RCB wanted. It's a golden duck for {{BATSMAN}}. Kohli must have had some strong words in the huddle before they walked out and he'd be delighted with this start. {{BATSMAN}} had a good last match, he tried to be positive first up in this game but this short of length delivery got big on him. Mistimed pull, went off the splice of the bat, Chahal did well to dive forward from short mid-wicket. He slid on those practice pitches but held on to the ball. {{BATSMAN}} c Chahal b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out U Yadav Run Out!! 1 run completed. This is suicidal. Chipped away towards sweeper cover and {{BATSMAN}} wanted the second. Just went through without looking at his partner who was busy ball-watching. They stumbled mid-pitch and Umesh eventually paid the price. Vijay Shankar fires a clean throw to {{BOWLER}}, who waits before dislodging the bails. Umesh was not even in the frame and this sums up {{TEAM}}'s day. U Yadav run out (Shankar/{{BOWLER}}) 14(9) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sarfaraz Khan!! Oh dear! That's a horror shot from KL, he was looking so good and now plays an atrocious heave, pushed through quicker and wider of off, KL was looking to mow it over the mid-wicket fence, doesn't get anywhere near the pitch of the ball, the fat top-edge loops towards short third man where Sarfaraz takes it with glee. End of a handy knock from the {{TEAM}} opener. {{BATSMAN}} c Sarfaraz Khan b {{BOWLER}} 47(30) [4s-2 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! A tame dismissal. Quite typical of {{BATSMAN}}'s defences in the early part of his innings. One of those famed stabby defences, just that he cannot keep this one down. But {{BOWLER}} decides to help him to an extent, getting his palms and almost grassing it. A three-time juggle before he earns himself a story for a lifetime. The replays show it to be much slower, yeah {{BATSMAN}} was made to check his defence causing the ball-lob. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 5(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! And off he goes. Gets the crowd going as well. {{BATSMAN}} is cursing himself off the field. It is yet another start for the Englishman that is not converted. It's always dangerous to shimmy down the wicket for a bowler like {{BOWLER}}, who generally skids the ball through, and that is what happened. {{BATSMAN}} came down the wicket and {{BOWLER}} pushed it through, by the time the Kent batsman could get his bat down, the ball was past him and crashed into off-stump. The partnership has been broken and just the opening RPS needed. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 24(17) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Morris!! Two quick wickets for Delhi and they are still alive in this match, only just though. The middle-order of {{TEAM}} hasn't been tested yet so the next phase can be an interesting one. It was a fuller length delivery attacking the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was getting restless. He goes back and wanted to lift it over mid-off, no timing on it and ends up hitting to Morris at mid-off who takes a good low catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Morris b {{BOWLER}} 10(18)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Fourth wicket for {{BOWLER}}. He's on a hat-trick. Another batsman falls prey to the slower delivery. The key with the off-pace delivery is that you have to hit the right length and {{BOWLER}} has managed to do that, {{BATSMAN}} went for the loft and only managed to cue-end beside the pitch. {{BOWLER}} runs across and reverse cups it. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 3(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! A chance and Faf has grabbed it cleanly. Redemption for Piyush, he struggled in the first two overs, but is pulling things back a touch. A poor start for {{BATSMAN}} in Royals colours - came down the track, got close to the ball and drilled the drive - went flat, hard and straight to long-off. Was perhaps looking to go over cover, but ended hitting it a lot straighter - was dying onto Faf, who slid forward and held on. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 5(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Nair Run Out!! 1 run completed. That's such an unfortunate way for this partnership to end. A run out. But what a timely breakthrough for the home team. The ball is nudged into the vacant mid-wicket region from {{BATSMAN}} who wants two. They're both running hard from the get-go, so there's not any hesitation there. But what an effort from Vijay Shankar running in from the boundary. He swoops in quickly and fires a brilliant throw on the bounce right beside the stumps. Nair run out (Vijay Shankar/{{BOWLER}}) 33(23) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Lewis!! Full ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slices it straight to Lewis at sweeper cover. He was right back in the crease expecting the fuller length, and was probably aiming to go inside out over extra cover. But the bat twisted in his hands. A fist-pump from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Lewis b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! {{BATSMAN}} targets the longest boundary and holes out. {{BOWLER}} gets his man, finally. Length delivery just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} moved across and whiplashed it. Needed to generate more power to clear the ropes. Fails and hits it straight to Dhawan at deep mid-wicket, who grabs it and does the thigh-five celebration. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 31(21) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Willey!! {{BATSMAN}} perishes. {{TEAM}} lose their fourth wicket. Cross-seam full ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} went hard at it and the bat turned on impact in his hands. Hence, skies it towards long-off. Willey steps forward and grabs it with ease. The visitors are losing steam here. {{BATSMAN}} c Willey b {{BOWLER}} 5(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! In the air.....gone! Went miles up in the air but unfortunately for {{BATSMAN}}, he hasn't got the distance on this one. It was banged in short by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull. Struck him high on the blade and flew towards deep mid-wicket where Axar settled under the skier. Easy catch. {{BATSMAN}} was trying to force the pace a bit but just couldn't execute the stroke well. {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 13(13)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pattinson!! Misbah moment? A scoop, after shuffling across to a slower delivery, but unlike Sreesanth, Pattinson has to backpedal and hold on. Doesn't matter, this game's sealed. {{BATSMAN}} c Pattinson b {{BOWLER}} 18(6) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Wah! Look at beaming smile on Maxi's face. Boy, is he delighted! Lands this on a length and gets the ball to drift back slightly around off, {{BATSMAN}} wasn't fuly committed on the forward push, plays tentatively and inside-edges it back onto his stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by A Russell!! That's a tame dismissal for {{BATSMAN}} and the Daredevils have lost half their side. This was full and this was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} saw the opportunity for a few runs, got his left leg out of the way and was looking to smash it over cover. He went so hard that he lost all the poise and flow, ended up slicing it straight to Russell at short extra-cover. As easy as it comes. {{BATSMAN}} c A Russell b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chahal!! He's got this pull high on the bat, and the miscue is taken at midwicket. {{BOWLER}} screams in celebration, Kohli screams louder. Short of length, it was onto {{BATSMAN}} quicker than he expected, and so there was no timing on the shot. Much needed for the RCB. {{BATSMAN}} c Chahal b {{BOWLER}} 35(21) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{TEAM}} won't play out their quota of overs. That was a slower delivery and the batsman went for the slog sweep but was outdone by the lack of pace on it. The batsman knelt down, may be guessed the pace right, but could not connect at all for the LED bails to lighten up. KKR camp is chuffed. So is the crowd and the entire team. The on-field umpire did check for a no-ball but it is KKR's evening and nothing can go wrong. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 26(18) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Livingstone!! The fun comes to an end for {{BATSMAN}}. Bunny alert! {{BOWLER}} gets the prized scalp of the {{TEAM}} skipper for the second time in the tournament. What a tournament he's having. Some relief for RR here. It was tossed up luringly at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} flexes his arms and slogs it, didn't connect it as he would've liked and picks out Livingstone at long-on, who comfortably holds onto it. {{BATSMAN}} c Livingstone b {{BOWLER}} 25(7) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! The dreaded slower delivery from {{BOWLER}} does the trick. He might have got 90% of his wickets with it. {{BATSMAN}} thought it was in his arc and can for the loft over long-off, but since there was no pace on the ball, it lobbed to McCullum, who takes the dolly. {{BATSMAN}} c Brendon McCullum b {{BOWLER}} 7(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Shorey! \"Wickets in packs\" - that was Bhajji's catchphrase when he played for India, and it has reappeared all these years later. A gentle half-tracker, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and nails itflat towards long-on but picks out Shorey to perfection! Gives {{BATSMAN}} a little smile, and he looks shell-shocked, does {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Shorey b {{BOWLER}} 28(28) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Maxwell!! Good captaincy from Maxi. {{BATSMAN}} hit a boundary that went aerial over mid-on in the previous over. Now he's placed himself in the deep and swallowed an easy catch. Disastrous start for {{TEAM}} after opting to bat. Credit to {{BOWLER}} as well for dropping it short and cramping the batsman for room on seeing the batsman advance, {{BATSMAN}} wasn't in the best of positions to play, yet he went through with the hoick, totally mistimed it in the end. {{BATSMAN}} c Maxwell b {{BOWLER}} 7(12) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chawla!! Well, the conventional sweep didn't work so lets try the reverse sweep. It still doesn't come off and {{BATSMAN}} has to go. The off-break from {{BOWLER}} and kept turning into {{BATSMAN}}, who shaped to play the reverse sweep/pull, fetched it from outside leg and spliced it towards backward point. Chawla ran back a few yards and reverse cupped it. In fact, {{BATSMAN}} changed his grip and tried the switch hit. {{BATSMAN}} c Chawla b {{BOWLER}} 19(19) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ravi Bishnoi!! The young man perishes. The run rate might have had a role to play. More than 10 per needed from ball one and {{BATSMAN}} tried for an over enthusiastic pull. Backed away, top-edged it and the man at mid-on took it. The 'Salute Celebration' is back as well. {{BATSMAN}} c Ravi Bishnoi b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rabada! It's a super-over! A full-toss on the leg-stump, and he's flicked this straight to Rabada at short square leg, who holds on! A nightmare start to the over, from {{BOWLER}}, and he's managed to bring it to a tie. NOW NOW! {{BATSMAN}} c Rabada b {{BOWLER}} 5(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit! That's the end of a comprehensive performance from the Mumbai Indians. {{BATSMAN}} backs away and tries slicing that over cover, but Rohit inside the circle takes a catch above his head to end a memorable night for Mumbai. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mathews!! Third wicket for {{BOWLER}}. Not his best of deliveries, but he wouldn't mind as it takes his wicket tally into double digits. Short of length and on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} premeditated and got inside the line, he gets the pull off the cue-end and Mathews at deep backward square made no mistake. {{BATSMAN}} c Mathews b {{BOWLER}} 70(50) [4s-7 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Given out lbw. {{BATSMAN}} immediately reviews. Has it pitched in line? No under edge on the sweep. UltraEdge throws that up. Umpire's call and {{BATSMAN}} is gone. Erasmus the umpire who was happy to oblige that appeal from {{BOWLER}}. Pitched in line with leg stump and straightened just enough to clip leg. {{BATSMAN}} was beaten on the sweep and has to make his way out. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 45(31) [4s-2 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! A first-ball duck on IPL debut for {{BATSMAN}} - a perfect start to the game for {{BOWLER}}, this was pitched up and nipped back in sharply - {{BATSMAN}} hasn't had an idea about the conditions, went with hard hands on the drive - the ball burst past the inside edge and rattled the off-stump. It goes for a walk and the celebrations start in the DC camp. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mohit {{BOWLER}}!! {{BOWLER}} has two now and the Daredevils have lost both openers. On a good length and a hint of shape away from outside off, {{BATSMAN}} took a step down the track and was looking to work it towards the on-side, closed the bat-face early, gets a thick leading edge - high and towards mid-off. A simple grab by Mohit and Delhi find themselves in early trouble. {{BATSMAN}} c Mohit {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(14) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! What a wicket that is. Two in the over for {{BOWLER}}. A game-changing over? Will only know once the match is done. But certainly SRH now get a chance to come back into the game. Wasn't a great delivery, off-pace and down leg, but {{BATSMAN}} found Dhawan at deep backward square. After taking the catch, he puts a finger to his lip and points to the crowd suggesting to keep quiet. Typical Dhawan. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chawla!! Oh dear! We saw this yesterday for RCB, now {{BATSMAN}} falls to a long hop. Dropped short and on the stumps, begging to be smacked, {{BATSMAN}} swivelled across and nailed the pull, hard and flat - straight into the hands of Chawla at deep mid-wicket. The Eden Gardens finds its voice once again, {{BATSMAN}} falls after an impressive knock. {{BATSMAN}} c Chawla b {{BOWLER}} 43(26) [4s-7 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! An appeal for lbw against {{BATSMAN}} and umpire Nigel Llong shakes his head in denial. Well, MI have decided to review. Fair delivery. It was the quicker googly and {{BATSMAN}} was way out of his crease and the impact is above the knee-roll. What does the ball-tracker say? Three reds and {{BATSMAN}} has to go. Llong can't belive it and so can't I. Brilliant review from Mumbai. {{BATSMAN}} misses the clip as he didn't the pick the wrong 'un and was also late to bring his bat down. HawkEye showed it be hitting the leg stump. There's the breakthrough and it's the 20-year-old who does the job for the visitors. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 22(20) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! It's turned and gone through the gate. Came slower than {{BATSMAN}} expected and he was through his pull shot early. Short and turning back in, {{BATSMAN}} targeted the mid-wicket boundary, but lost his sticks. Anyway, has done his job as an opener in his first outing for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 43(27) [4s-6 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled! Knocked him over! {{BATSMAN}} has no clue about that googly, hasn't read it out of the hand, leaves a gaping hole between the bat and pad trying to play the expansive inside out drive, as if to a leg-break, but that one turns in and crashes into the stumps of {{BATSMAN}}. It's Yuzi again, who's picked up the King-pin (from the last game at least). {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 26(20) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! Atrocious from {{BATSMAN}}! Another one bites the dust and {{TEAM}} are clearly struggling at the moment. They aren't helping their cause either by not adapting to this surface. Short of a length from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} once again backs away, like he did previous ball. What he also did, was to try a weird slog that was never a percentage stroke on this pitch. Only manages it high, off the inside half of the bat, towards mid-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bhuvneshwar Run Out!! Bhuvneshwar is run-out trying to steal a bye. MS does not miss out on the opportunity. Bouncer on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} shuffled across, got inside the line and failed to connect with the pull shot, Bhuvneshwar called for the run and he was caught well short. Dhoni hitting the sticks with an under-arm throw. Excellent finish to the {{TEAM}} innings though, 20 runs off the final over. Bhuvneshwar run out (Dhoni) 7(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! This was coming, not many runs in the over and {{BATSMAN}} was getting increasingly agitated, deserving reward for the elder {{BOWLER}}. This was tossed up on the stumps, perhaps a bit slow off the surface as well, {{BATSMAN}} slogged hard and flat, no real elevation behind the shot, straight into the bucket hands of Pollard at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} gets a pat on his back by his former U-19 captain, Kishan, as he walks back. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 64(44) [4s-4 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} walks off after having a chat with his partner. The golden arm of {{BOWLER}} strikes for MI and {{TEAM}} lose their first wicket. {{BATSMAN}} wasn't looking fluid from the start, found it difficult to get going and {{BOWLER}} has trapped him. It was the off-paced delivery, dipped upon pitching and the batsman was caught playing down the wrong line. Completely missed it, getting struck in-line with the stumps. HawkEye confirms that it's crashing into middle and leg stump. The blue flags are out and MI fans are elated. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 9(16)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The aeroplane takes off. Second wicket for {{BOWLER}} and what a selection he's been for GL. Another biggie for the home side. A set Ben {{BATSMAN}} departs. It was the knuckle ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} did not pick it and was early into his drive, the ball catches the inside edge and deflects off the pads onto the stumps. {{TEAM}} in a spot of bother now. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 25(18) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Dhoni pouches, up goes the umpire's finger and there's the roar from the Chepauk crowd. A soft dismissal. An innocuous short of length delivery on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} moved across to help it along its way. Gets a faint under-edge onto his thigh and the ball lobs up in the air. MS moves to his right to snaffle that. A straightforward catch for the captain. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 16(14) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gowtham!! Gowtham juggles but manages to hang on. {{BATSMAN}} never looked in. Yes, seven deliveries is enough to judge that. The off-cutter from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} had to for the heave and all he could do was sky it up towards long-on. Gowtham settled under it and almost made a mess. Luckily for him it didn't go far from his body and he took it on the second attempt. {{BATSMAN}} c Gowtham b {{BOWLER}} 3(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Back of a length delivery and the batsman drags it onto his sticks, after the ball tickled his body. That was another slower delivery I would believe and the batsman was through his shot a bit too early. {{BOWLER}} is back and how! Mumbai after a stutter against RPS have found their mojo back. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by R Tripathi!! Dismal IPL for {{BATSMAN}} continues. He will consider himself massively unlucky, a meter to the fielder's right or left and that was a four. It was a short of length ball, {{BATSMAN}} gets in a good position, connects well, he does everything well but finds the fielder at deep square leg. This just get to show how imperative placement is in cricket. {{BATSMAN}} c R Tripathi b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out de Grandhomme Run Out!! de Grandhomme isn't the quickest between the wickets. MS hits direct and there's no dive from the Kiwi. {{BATSMAN}} is beaten on the dab to the slower delivery, MS does the rest with the gloves on. de Grandhomme run out (Dhoni) 11(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! Is there MS Dhoni's mind behind this dismissal? CSK fans would know. In 2010, he had a straightish mid-off to dismiss the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} in the final. Now {{TEAM}} got a very straight long-off - a field placement you normally don't see in cricket - and {{BATSMAN}} hits it straight to him. This was full and in the slot from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} was in the mood to murder the ball, he went hard, hit it flat and hard, but little did he know that he fell in the trap. It's 65 for 5 now. {{BATSMAN}} c Manoj Tiwary b {{BOWLER}} 7(3) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Shakib Run Out!! {{BATSMAN}} has sold Shakib down the river here. {{BATSMAN}} turned this to the short mid area and said an yes, Shakib too responded and then the {{TEAM}} skipper belted out a loud no. By then Shakib was almost halfway down and Surya took his time, aimed and hit direct. What a waste of a wicket. Shakib is too disappointed to say anything. Just walks off. Shakib run out (Suryakumar Yadav) 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Outstanding pressure catch from Hardik Pandya in the deep. {{BATSMAN}} had skied this up a mile off a top-edge, he had Evin Lewis in the corner of his eye - converging towards him, but Pandya calls for it and takes it much to the delight of the roaring fans at the Wankhede. Length ball, {{BATSMAN}} saw the opportunity and cleared his front leg to make the most of it. But his heave came right off the toe-end. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 46(35) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, not sure what prompted Rahane to take the review. Always seemed like pitching outside leg and the replays confirm it. Loopy and full around leg, {{BATSMAN}} missed the sweep and was rapped on the pad. Never looked close at all. Desperation perhaps. The batsmen crossed during the appeal\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Riyan Parag!! Wowza! It's two in two for {{BOWLER}}. Pin-drop silence in the ground. Put your hands together for this young leggie. He's been a star for RR and continues to impress. Well-flighted {{BATSMAN}}livery again, drawing {{BATSMAN}} into a false shot. AB wiel{{BATSMAN}}d his bat hard, loses his balance and shape completely. Skies it into the night sky as the timing goes for a toss. Riyan Parag at extra cover calls for it and settles un{{BATSMAN}}r it. Big setback this for {{TEAM}}. {{BOWLER}} on a hat-trick now. {{BATSMAN}} c Riyan Parag b {{BOWLER}} 10(4) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Zaheer!! Zaheer takes a catch and claims it. The umpires decide to go up and the soft signal is out. It was darted in on off, {{BATSMAN}} danced down, moved leg-side and went for the inside-out shot. Couldn't get enough elevation on that and finds Zak at extra cover. The ball was dipping when it approached him, but Zaheer had both his hands underneath the ball. Second wicket for Shahbaz {{BOWLER}}. Now, it's all down to the four foreign recruits for {{TEAM}} to make a match out of this. {{BATSMAN}} c Zaheer b {{BOWLER}} 7(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Easy peasy! {{TEAM}} lose another. {{BATSMAN}}'s woeful season continues. Nothing but a dart on middle and leg, might have slightly gripped the surface, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to work it into the on-side and closed the bat face, the leading edge lobs up to the right of {{BOWLER}}, who moves across and ahead of Pathan to gobble that up. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 8(16)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gowtham!! Stunner! Needed something like this to break this partnership and the two Karnataka lads combine to send {{BATSMAN}} back. Another wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} once more spotted it early, sat down on his knee to play the slog and sweep, struck it powerfully and flat towards deep mid-wicket, the ball was dying in front of Gowtham, who covered good ground, dived full length and took it inches from the ground. {{BATSMAN}} c Gowtham b {{BOWLER}} 46(29) [4s-9]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Big wicket for Pune, but was the ball sliding down the leg-side? {{BATSMAN}} was done in for the lack of pace from {{BOWLER}}, he rolled his fingers across this slower ball and drifted it back into the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was shuffling across on the flick and missed, struck in front of middle and leg, but was the angle taking it down the leg-side? Need to see more replays, but Pune will not care one bit. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 21(14) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! Gone! But {{BATSMAN}} has done more than his job. A fine knock from the 'keeper. Slower delivery at 125.4ks and {{BATSMAN}} does not have the power to clear this big boundaries, he still goes through and makes a decent connection, holes out just in front of the long-on rope. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 67(41) [4s-9 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned up! It has all gone downward in the last 20 minutes or so. {{BOWLER}} picks up his third. A juicy full toss and {{BATSMAN}} could have hit it anywhere, he backs away and is beaten for pace, the ball brushes the off-stump to light it up. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} gets his man and sends the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} packing back to the hut. He's been short on confidence with the ball in this tournament but this wicket is a much-needed boost. Poor shot from {{BATSMAN}}, perhaps was tempted by the flight there as he leant forward aiming for an agricultural heave, didn't fully commit himself as the ball dipped in after pitching. Sneaks in with a hint of spin and rattles the off-pole. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 24(16) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! Terrific catch by a flying DK! Excellent delivery too. Short of a length around off and jags away a tad. {{BATSMAN}} tries to defend it off his back foot, gets squared up somewhat and gets a thick outside edge. The KKR skipper flies to his right and plucks it out of thin air. Not for the first time have we seen him take such a blinder. Quite an eventful over that. 17 runs and a wicket to cap it off. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 14(7) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Washington Sundar!! {{BOWLER}} has his name in the wicket column. Short of length delivery following {{BATSMAN}}, who had made room to smash one into the on-side, the ball kept cramping him for room and once the bat face was closed, the leading edge lobbed to backward point. Sundar accepts the dolly there. {{BATSMAN}} c Washington Sundar b {{BOWLER}} 6(5) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Rovman Powell!! Feel for this fella! He deserved a 100 or at least needed to be there till the end. Similar emotions from Smithy as he tweaks his hair in disappointment. Takes on the short ball this time and pulls to the right of short mid-wicket, there's Rovman Powell fielding there? He is from the Caribbean, won't drop catches. Dives full length and takes a blinder. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Rovman Powell b {{BOWLER}} 93(52) [4s-9 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Eoin Morgan!! First wicket for {{BOWLER}} in IPL 2017. Has struck in his first over. Tosses it up this time, the ball dips in a touch. {{BATSMAN}} plays down the wrong line, gets a leading edge that ballons up straight to long-off. Morgan ain't dropping those.{{BATSMAN}} c Eoin Morgan b {{BOWLER}} 19(18) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Huge wicket and the blue flags are hoisted up at the Wankhede. Rohit is jubliant and so are rest of his mates. They know the value of this wicket. {{BATSMAN}} could have played anchor to this chase and he has been sent back early. The {{TEAM}} skipper premeditated the paddle and missed it completely, the ball struck him around the thigh pad in front of middle, it was going on to hit leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 3(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! There's the wicket MI were looking for! Precisely why Rohit brought {{BOWLER}} on, and the plan has worked. Fuller and wider outside off, might have been a tad slower than {{BOWLER}}'s usual deliveries and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get the timing on the loft. Picks out Polly at long-off and he ain't dropping these, not even with this 'catching flu' that's caught the IPL. An enterprising little knock from {{BATSMAN}} ends but he'll be gutted to go at this point. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 30(19) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Maxwell!! Massive wicket. 50th IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}}. And there comes the wicket after the break. Not a wicket taking delivery but credit to Maxwell for clinging on. The dangerous {{BATSMAN}} is back in the hut. Another half tracker from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} pulled and he wanted to clear Maxwell at deep mid-wicket, couldn't get enough power as he was arching back, the KXIP skipper timed his jumped to perfection and took it inches before the rope. After landing he ensured that he doesn't fall over. {{BATSMAN}} c Maxwell b {{BOWLER}} 32(24) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! The young man gets the big fish! A luring delivery tossed up outside off and the batsman looking to thwack it down the ground, finds the able hands of Stokes at long-off. That brings the game back in the balance. {{BATSMAN}} was struggling to get the runs and pays the penalty trying to up the ante. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 28(27) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! There's an appeal but the umpire has been stunned by this kid. Even the umpire. {{BOWLER}} appeals, and after eliciting an obvious edge, and appeals again and then gets his man. Rishabh {{BATSMAN}} doesn't fall short of a century here; he makes 97. Brutes them. Enthralling innings. {{BOWLER}} angled this full and across, {{BATSMAN}} drives and ekes out an outside edge, that's been nicely taken by Karthik behind. Erred in not using his feet there, and {{BOWLER}} is quick. But he was in that sort of a mood. He was hitting everything outta here, so can't blame him. Not after 97 runs, can we? {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 97(43) [4s-6 6s-9]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Shreyas Iyer Run Out!! Disaster for DD! For the second time in the tournament, {{BATSMAN}} has ran Shreyas Iyer out due to some terrible running between the wickets. Waste of a wicket really and now, the Daredevils are in serious trouble. Another cutter and {{BATSMAN}} got a thick inside edge onto the pad as the ball rolled to the left of an alert Goswami. Shreyas Iyer wanted the run and by the time it was denied, he was almost near a shakehand distance from {{BATSMAN}}. Too late to go back and Goswami's throw is on the money to {{BOWLER}} who does the rest. Out by a countrymile. Shreyas Iyer run out (Goswami/{{BOWLER}}) 3(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Oh what a ball. What a ball. He tosses this on off, gets it to dip on AB to draw him out of the crease and then turns it right across him for the stumping. This is a brilliant piece of leg-spin bowling. AB was ambitiously trying to flick this through mid-wicket but he's beaten in flight and length. Dhoni, quick as ever, hardly takes any time to whip those bails off. That's lightning glovework. This is on. {{BATSMAN}} st Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 29(30) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! Another bites the dust. And {{BATSMAN}} is gutted with himself, absolutely gutted. He smashes the bat in air after he edged it. Oh these young players! It was a normal leggie wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} plays a nothing shot. He wanted to steer it wide of slips, ends up playing too fine and hands a simple catch to Watson at slip. Half of the team is back in the hut now. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! Another one for {{BOWLER}}. He's taking down Punjab single handedly tonight. Got Rahul and Gayle earlier, gets Ashwin and {{BATSMAN}} now. This was short of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} tried to punch it off his back foot but his bottom hand came off and he ended up miscuing it to mid-off. Can't get any easier for Raina! {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! That's a terrific catch by Pant. Is there anything, he can't do? Flies to his left and plucks this one with his left glove. Knight Riders in trouble with three of their top-order batsmen back to the hut. A short delivery down the leg side and {{BATSMAN}} gets a glove as he looks to play the pull shot. The run rate is well under 6 at the moment. Can they stitch in a partnership? {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 20(18) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Devdutt Padikkal!! Fantastic catch by Padikkal. Huge wicket for RCB as it is the in-form Delhi skipper walking back. He does fancy clearing the rope against the spinners and would have as well if he was playing in Sharjah or Abu Dhabi, but not here. Flighted around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes with the spin and heaves it to deep mid-wicket, Padikkal settles under it and clutches with both hands, then throws the ball up, goes outside the boundary rope and comes back in to complete the catch. Excellent awareness shown by the youngster. {{BATSMAN}} c Devdutt Padikkal b {{BOWLER}} 11(13) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! Faf and his magic at the boundary. Those spring ankles take over. {{BATSMAN}} powered this flighted delivery down the ground, but Faf, very mindful of the boundary, jumped, landed on the left foot, released the ball as he was about to cross the boundary as he was overbalancing. Then quickly recovered to pouch it safely. A really handy innings from {{BATSMAN}}. He's impressed for sure! {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 42(31) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Harshal Patel Run Out!! 1 run completed. What is {{BATSMAN}} doing? That's the second run-out he's involved in tonight. Flicks the flatter delivery to short mid-wicket and gets the single. Calls for the second too but as the throw comes in at the striker's end he sends Harshal back. Goswami fumbles on the first attempt - doesn't gather the ball cleanly - but reacts quickly and gets the direct hit right on the second one with an underhanded flick onto the stumps. Harshal Patel run out (Shikhar Dhawan/Goswami) 24(17) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! That was completely unnecessary from {{BATSMAN}} and it has cost him his wicket. This was a floaty delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} got underneath it and drilled it towards extra-cover. Almost a catch to Nadeem, he doesn't go for it though, instead, stops it on the half-volley, the return to the bowler is good and {{BOWLER}} whips the bails off - with {{BATSMAN}} miles out of the crease. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Nadeem/{{BOWLER}}) 9(5) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! The time-out syndrome. {{BATSMAN}} had to kick on, and he decides to do it with a lofted whip. The ball just doesn't come on, sticks, grabs the inside half of his bat and for a change somebody can catch. But Iyer almost keeps up with the trend - running across from long-on and juggling. Just. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 34(32) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! What's happening DD? This game ain't over. It has in fact come alive. The in-form {{BATSMAN}} departs. Two early wickets for MI and just the started they needed. Good length ball around off, might have stopped on {{BATSMAN}}, who checked his front foot push and spooned a dolly to mid-off. Full marks for Rohit, he had placed himself close in. If he was on the edge, it wouldn't have carried. {{BOWLER}} is pumped up. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 9(6) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! {{BATSMAN}} has hit it straight to Raina at cover and he looks bamboozled. {{BOWLER}} has yet again picked up a breakthrough with the new ball. It was on a good length and there was lot of width. {{BATSMAN}} was enticed by the room, he went hard on his trademark punch shot, fails to control it and ends up gifting a catch to cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 4(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! {{BATSMAN}} walks. Clear inside edge and the umpire's finger is up too. Nipped in a tad, from a good length, {{BATSMAN}} had his bat face open to play the dab to third man, but it kissed the inside edge and went to the keeper. That's a wicket {{TEAM}} ill-afforded to lose. Massive blow. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 29(21) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! That's a very, very rare occurence. MS {{BATSMAN}} caught napping is not something which happens very often. It doesn't happen at all. The slower ball deflects off {{BATSMAN}}'s thigh towards short fine leg, and {{BATSMAN}} is just ambling across not expecting Shami to go at his end. Once {{BATSMAN}} realizes the danger, he motors through and even puts in a dive, but he's caught short by a few inches or so as Shami rockets the stumps down. Big wicket. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Shami) 5(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, out de Grandhomme Run Out!! Low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drives it to extra cover and went for the single. Grandhomme took a few yards before backing out. Both batsmen tries to return back to the crease and the throw from the fielder comes to the non striker's end. The Kiwi all-round was pretty lazy in grounding his bat and {{BOWLER}} breaks the stumps to catch him short of his crease. There was also another run-out chance at the striker's end as {{BATSMAN}} was struggling to make his ground. {{BOWLER}} lasers the throw to Bairstow, who ends up crashing into the stumps. Total confusion there. Phew! de Grandhomme run out (Bhuvneshwar/{{BOWLER}}) 37(32) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rabada!! This was inevitable. With the way, he was timing it, you'd sensed it, a wicket was round the corner. {{BATSMAN}}'s painful stay at the crease comes to an end and has he played his last game for {{TEAM}}? You never know. DC are a happy bunch. A simple back of a length delivery just outside off, some extra zip and pace did the trick for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} just swung his bat, got it high on the bat and spooned a dolly to Rabada at mid-on. {{TEAM}} two down and in a spot of bother. {{BATSMAN}} c Rabada b {{BOWLER}} 10(15) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Clatters the stumps with a googly. {{BATSMAN}} has had his fun, no more. Tries for another slog-sweep but probably didn't pick the variation. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 16(10) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! DD have been bundled out for their lowest score in IPL - the 10th edition is bringing in some unwanted records for teams. First it was RCB - now it's the DD. Slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} didn't read it at all, popped his bat forward, closed the face on the tuck, got a leading edge and it's an absolute dolly to the bowler. Not sure if the Mohali crowd enjoyed the show from DD - you don't want to watch a mismatch after having paid big money for the tickets. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hetmyer!! Smart catch from Hetmyer, but think he's unsure about the catch. The umpires will go upstairs and the soft signal is OUT. Did he get his fingers undernath the ball? It's a fair delivery and it's a fair catch, but has the ball touched the ground as he rolled over? Was he under control? Sunil Gavaskar thinks it's NOT OUT as he wasn't in complete control. But what will the third umpire think? He thinks {{BATSMAN}} is OUT. Two wickets in the over and RCB are pulling things back - this was dropped short and {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes lit up - rocked back on the pull, didn't get hold of the shot, was in the air for a long time, Hetmyer got across from deep mid-wicket, slid forward and completed a good two-handed catch. As he rolled over, the ball might / might not have touched the grass. Tough call, but the soft signal was OUT and the third umpire had no conclusive proof to overturn it. {{BATSMAN}} c Hetmyer b {{BOWLER}} 9(12) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw! {{BATSMAN}}'s been given LBW! He's gone for a review straightaway! Now that the umpire has given it out, I think this is clipping leg. Just a hunch. A full delivery angling into the pads, he's missed a juicy half-volley, attempting a cross-batted flick. Pitching in line, hitting him in line, and clipping the leg-stump. Yep, I was right - not for the first time (wink) - it's the umpire's call taking a toll again as the batting side are left with the consolation prize of a retained review. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 15(11) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Shakib Run Out!! KKR keep chipping away at the wickets. Just when the partnership had started to built, they have got rid of the set batsman. Floaty delivery and {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg to have a clean swing at that, drills it straight back and {{BOWLER}} gets a fingertip on it before the ball crashes into the stumps. Shakib was backing up and he had no time to make his way back. Caught well short of the crease. Shakib is disappointed and keeps shaking his head as he makes his way to the dugout. Shakib run out ({{BOWLER}}) 28(24) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Smith!! All too easy. All too familiar. The tried and tested ploy to a tail-ender and for the umpteenth time in history, it pays off. {{BOWLER}} lets out one of the floatiest of leg-breaks tossing it very wide outside the sticks. {{BATSMAN}} sinks on a knee, slogs it big time. It grows big on him, takes the outside half of the bat and all it finds is cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Smith b {{BOWLER}} 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Agarwal!! Clever from {{BOWLER}}! Sensed {{BATSMAN}} giving the charge and slowed it down considerably, while also dragging the length back ever so slightly. The attempted lofted stroke ended up as a miscue and Mayank at long-off accepted the sitter with joy. KXIP have broken through, courtesy their skipper who is actually having a fine season so far. {{BATSMAN}} c Agarwal b {{BOWLER}} 19(9) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught!! Well, {{BOWLER}} was not sure why the third umpire was called. In the end, he has the wicket of his fellow state-mate. It was the googly and {{BATSMAN}} was cramped for room. He was looking to guide it to third man and it went off the face of the bat. Samson caught it and then dislodged the bails. Wierdly, the keeper didn't appeal for caught-behind. The TV umpire was called for a stumping appeal and {{BATSMAN}}'s back leg was in the air. He was out twice and I reckon the dismissal will be changed to caught! {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 61(36) [4s-9]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Basil Thampi!! Maiden IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to smack another one out of the park. What was the need? You have to ask him. It was quicker and on off, {{BATSMAN}} could not quite get underneath that, but still went through with the swipe, Thampi at deep mid-wicket didn't have to move an inch to pouch that. Another set batsmen throws it away for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Basil Thampi b {{BOWLER}} 32(19) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That's a beauty from Varun {{BOWLER}}! The slower knuckle ball from the pacer swung in sharply and {{BATSMAN}} couldn't account for it. He was looking to ease it through the off-side and ended up playing outside the line of it. A faint inside edge and the ball crashes onto the stumps. Varun {{BOWLER}} has removed both the openers. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 14(14) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nabi!! Another one falls prey to the slower ball. On such a sluggish surface, it's expected really but even then, {{TEAM}}'s batsmen have mostly failed to apply themselves. Can't fault {{BATSMAN}} though for going big with less than two overs left. Tries to go over cover but it's the slower ball that's well wide outside off, he had to reach it and mistimed it horribly. Spoons a dolly to extra cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Nabi b {{BOWLER}} 17(15) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Knocked him over. Gambhir departed early and it's {{BATSMAN}} who departs now. That was a flat and quick delivery on leg, {{BATSMAN}} goes back in his crease to drag it away but gets undone due to the lack of bounce. The ball skids on and takes down his leg-stump. Fine display of bowling by RCB this has been so far. Both DD openers are back in the pavilion now. Onus on the middle order batsmen to get them out of trouble. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(16)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by U Yadav!! {{BOWLER}} bowls length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and backs himself to clear the fence. Doesn't get the timing right and spoons a simple catch to Umesh at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c U Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 38(31) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Neesham!! Tag-team effort by Maxwell and Neesham has helped Punjab get rid of the Hitman. Maxwell did all the hard work there, but Neesham makes sure that his effort isn't in vain. Was lofted towards long-off by {{BATSMAN}} as Maxy grabbed it and just when he was about to overhaul the boundary, he parried it to Neesham who was charging across from long-on. {{BOWLER}} has been the strike bowler for Punjab this season, and here's why. {{BATSMAN}} c Neesham b {{BOWLER}} 70(45) [4s-8 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Oh plumb. A harmless straight delivery, on a length, on middle and not really turning either. {{BATSMAN}} sweeps, or at least tries to. And misses big time to find himself trapped, dead. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 29(27) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Milne!! How big a wicket is this? You just have to look at the celebrations in RCB camp. {{BATSMAN}} throws his head down as he makes a long walk back to the pavilion. Shuffles and takes on the slower ball, looks for the pick-up hoick but gets it too low on the bat. In in the air and it gives ample time for deep square to settle under it. A slight fumble, but Milne had it covered. {{BATSMAN}} c Milne b {{BOWLER}} 45(32) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Brathwaite!! Has Brathwaite taken this? It will be a sensational catch if he has. Tom Moody gets on his feet in the dugout. Big moment. The soft signal is out. And it doesn't take long for the third umpire to uphold the onfield call. Dhoni looks a bit miffed as he crosses his arms. Full ball, not an easy length to get under, which is why {{BATSMAN}}'s loft hardly finds much elevation. It's a flat hit in front of long-on, with the ball dipping on Brathwaite and making him the second favourite. But he charges in while covering great ground and dives forward to get his fingers underneath. What a game he's had. {{BATSMAN}} c Brathwaite b {{BOWLER}} 10(6) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! No, no. None of his late antics tonight. The innings was always painful .. to play, to watch. And it ends painfully. It's quick from {{BOWLER}}, zipping in a little too straight. But {{BATSMAN}} decides to swing him over cow corner. Barely connects, gets the elevation. And Kohli's waiting. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 32(35) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mishra!! The Daredevils have opened their tally and it's {{BOWLER}} who has the final wicket. On a good length and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was backing away on the drive, doesn't get hold of the shot and chips it tamely towards cover. Mishra runs forward, dives and completes the catch. A 97-run mauling at home for Pune, they would love to forget today's display as soon as possible. {{BATSMAN}} c Mishra b {{BOWLER}} 7(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Go {{BOWLER}}, make a GIF out of this and retire. Virat {{BATSMAN}}'s been done. Sees {{BATSMAN}} shimmy out and still keeps it straight at the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} overruns, letting the ball sneak through and timbah. The trick was that {{BOWLER}} stuck to a normal pace delivery. {{BATSMAN}} would have connected had it been a slower one. Wasn't and bam, {{BATSMAN}} is gone. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nikhil Naik!! {{BOWLER}} strikes in his first over. That was in the air for an eternity, but the fiel{{BATSMAN}}r there - Nikhil has managed to pouch it. Back of a length {{BATSMAN}}livery by the young pacer and {{BATSMAN}} plays an-across-the-line wild hoick, A thick top-edge is induced as the South African gets caught at mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Nikhil Naik b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! Fuller, slower delivery and has hit it straight to the man at mid-off. Backed away, toe-ended it and could not infuse any momentum on the shot to hole out. But he has done his job. CSK strike but seems a little too late in the context of the game. Change of pace has accounted for another wicket though. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 50(25) [4s-10]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Confusion and it results in a run out. {{BATSMAN}} mistimes the loft towards long-on and he was never interested in the second, Kuldeep pushed for it and {{BATSMAN}} decided to go, but the batsmen didn't cross each other when {{BOWLER}} removed the bails which means {{BATSMAN}} was the one to be dismissed. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Dhawan/{{BOWLER}}) 12(5) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Gone this time. This one looked like a six to the naked eye, wasn't to be. A full ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went for the loft over extra cover but he skewed it off the toe-end and offered a dolly of a catch to SKY at wide long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 31(20) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rutherford!! Hat-trick of golden ducks for {{BATSMAN}}! Becomes the first ever batsman to get out for five successive ducks in T20 cricket. Can you believe it! Things going from bad to worse! Gets deceived due to the slower delivery once again and chips the fullish delivery straight to Rutherford at extra cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Rutherford b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni! Short ball, and that does the trick! Right at the body, really brave bowling, he's hurried on the pull and top-edges it - hardly any bat on that and Dhoni comes around, moves to his right, to take the citter of the century. A huge wicket in the context of the game, and Shardul has taken a key wicket here. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 29(17) [6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! Goes with the turn again. No, not really. It is the attempted doosra from Bhajji. Does not turn much but does the trick, {{BATSMAN}} miscues the big loft. Pollard gets under it at long-on and pushes Delhi closer to embarrassment. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 7(4) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! That's a soft dismissal for the captain - a leg-stump half-volley from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to work it to the on-side, closed the bat-face early, gets a fat leading edge, high and behind square on the on-side. Dhawan called for the catch, gets across from deep backward square leg, watches the ball all along and completes the catch - cuts to his trademark thighslap celebrations, the Royals have lost an easrly wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! He's whipped a pull straight to square leg. It was an innocuous short of length delivery into the body, not very high, and {{BATSMAN}} usually is pretty adept at dealing with those. But this time it seemed as if he didn't go through with the shot. It's straight down the throat of Dhawan. Can SRH still turn things around? {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 11(11) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Gone! Shardul {{BOWLER}} strikes. A nothing shot from the South African. No feet movement either. A cross-seamed length ball attacking the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} stays leg-side of the ball and plays down the wrong line. The stumps get shattered. CSK have an early breakthrough. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 7(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! This has been the story of the season for {{TEAM}}, says Sanjay Manjrekar on air - can't be wrong. This was tossed up on the stumps, AB was once again shuffling across, as a result - he left his leg-stump exposed, the ball drifted in, went past his attempted sweep and crashed into the leg-stump. A stunned AB has to walk back to the hut. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 10(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! And {{BOWLER}} strikes. He was brought back to take out Russell but Rajasthan won't mind this. The set batsman departs and it is two new batsmen out in the middle. 140.5kph back of a length delivery angled in to the right hander, {{BATSMAN}} is a tad early into his flick and the leading edge balloons up, {{BOWLER}} calls for it and tumbles backwards as he completes the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 47(34) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} has been given OUT LBW. He talks with Russell and reviews it. Was it slipping down the leg-side? Don't think there's any bat on that, struck DK in front of leg-stump, but he's so back that the ball didn't have far to travel. Umpire's call on Hawk-Eye and {{BATSMAN}} is OUT. A handy knock from {{BATSMAN}} comes to an end, lovely yorker from {{BOWLER}}, followed {{BATSMAN}} slightly and struck him bang in front of leg-stump, it was the back-pad as well. The impact was in front of leg and would have been clipping the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 26(25) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! This was always coming! {{BATSMAN}} was looking to slog everything out of the park, on a good length and just outside off, might have been the slower ball, {{BATSMAN}} swung through the line, went off the toe-end of the bat, got plenty of height but not the distance. Kohli ran across to his left from long-on and held on to a simple catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 7(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Anukul Roy!! Different ways to get your name out there. He probably won't get a chance to showcase his left-arm spin this season, but Anukul Roy has pulled off a blinder as a substitute fielder. Sliced off a thick outside edge as {{BATSMAN}} tries to go leg-side. It goes up and behind Roy at short cover. He runs back, eyes on the ball which is going further and further away, but he races after it and dives with both hands, parallel to the ground while taking it. Stunning. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Anukul Roy b {{BOWLER}} 11(13) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Siraj!! {{BATSMAN}} wanted to go for the fourth six, but holes out. A fullish googly marginally outside off, it was in the slot for the lefty to go over long-off. But, the bat turned at the point of impact. Siraj, at long-off, initially misjudged as he was a couple of yards inside the boundary rope. However, he recovered well and timed his jump perfectly to take a pressure catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Siraj b {{BOWLER}} 23(12) [6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Yorker! The good old yorker. {{BOWLER}} had been hit for two boundaries already and had to fall back upon to his main weapon. Bowls it right at the base of the middle stump. {{BATSMAN}}'s swing does not meet the ball and the furniture gets disturbed. What can Karthik do from the other end. He has run out of partners now. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 22(12) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! It cannot get any worse for {{TEAM}} and {{BATSMAN}}. He is having a terrible season and has only dashed the hopes of a {{TEAM}} revival in this game as well. Gentle {{BOWLER}}livery on the pads and the batsman en{{BOWLER}}d up nicking it to the keeper. The keeper went up almost instantly and RCB have their man. {{BATSMAN}} c Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 2(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rutherford!! This was always coming! Four dot balls and Mayank throws his wicket away, came down the track way too early - {{BOWLER}} saw it and went short, good pace and good bounce - cramped for room, Mayank's attempted cross-batted swat went nowhere, straight up in the air and towards cover-point. The debutant Rutherford was under the ball, watched it like a hawk and completes the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Rutherford b {{BOWLER}} 2(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Woakes!! The Gardens explode. The Garden city self-implodes. The sticker on the track consumes another. {{BATSMAN}} looks to fetch one from off as he attempts whipping it away. The ball meanwhile takes an eternity in getting onto the bat taking the leading edge on the early flick to balloon to mid-on. Don't forget, Chris Gayle is stuck at the other end. {{BATSMAN}} c Woakes b {{BOWLER}} 9(7) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! {{BATSMAN}} gets greedy and throws his wicket away! Lovely ball from {{BOWLER}}, slowed down the pace on this leg-break, {{BATSMAN}} was setting himself up for the slog sweep, gets a fat top-edge, high and towards long-on. Hardik kept back-pedalling, didn't lose sight over the ball and completes a fine two-handed overhead catch. Much needed wicket for MI, the two openers were threatening to take this game away. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 36(18) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! These knuckle balls are sticking in the pitch and darting away. {{BATSMAN}} gets a top-edge on his attempted flat-batted swish, for the keeper to take a good catch few paces to his right. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 29(27) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Prithvi Shaw Run Out!! Confusion^confusion. Shikhar calls, runs half way down, but is ball-watching all through as he does. Shaw responds, only to be sent back. And hence when both of them are stuck half way down the pitch, Mandeep nails the direct hit. How did it get to Mandeep? Well, it was a msicued chip to cover. Prithvi Shaw run out (Mandeep) 13(11) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! Huge wicket! Maiden IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}}! And it's his NZ skipper that he has sent back. Vital breakthrough for RR because the {{TEAM}} captain was batting like a dream. This one shot through low shockingly from a good length as {{BATSMAN}} tried to play the cut from the crease. It was a great take from Buttler and S.Ravi felt there was a bottom edge. KW didn't and went for the review. The replays didn't show anything to be honest but the snicko has a different story to tell. Tiniest of spikes or murmurs to be precise and {{BATSMAN}} had to go. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 63(43) [4s-7 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} is given out lbw and he reviews. Fair delivery. No bat involved. The impact was just above the kneeroll in front of off. What does the ball-tracker say? Three reds and {{BATSMAN}} goes off taking the only review with him. DD are falling apart here, without a fight. Turns in from a short of length and beats {{BATSMAN}}'s clip/flick. He wasn't forward as well. The umpire raised the finger quickly. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Kaboom! Who says the yorker has gone out of fashion? It never has and it never will. Lovely yorker from {{BOWLER}}, on the base of off stump and {{BATSMAN}} was making room to slam it through cover. Too good a nut for him and he fails to get his bat down in time. Timber it is! DD finish on 166/7. Is it enough? {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 13(13) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! A vociferous appeal for lbw and up goes the finger. {{BATSMAN}} isn't happy with the decision. The impact outside off maybe? No. {{BATSMAN}} got low on one knee to play the sweep shot and missed a straight ball. He is struck adjacent to the off-stump. That's crashing onto the stumps. Good call from the umpire. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 12(16) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sam Curran!! {{BATSMAN}} has picked out cow corner - the longest part of this ground - and {{BOWLER}} knows this, so ends up bowling a carrom ball forcing him to go across the line and against the spin. But once a Watto commitment stays a Watto commitment, ending up in the slog sweep leading to a big top-edge, which Curran - a cool few yards inside the boundary - runs across to gather. {{BATSMAN}} c Sam Curran b {{BOWLER}} 26(24) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! Back to back wickets for {{BOWLER}}, but what was {{BATSMAN}} trying to do? First ball and he looks to slog {{BOWLER}} out of the park - was the wrong 'un and he didn't get anywhere near the ball, sliced it high and over cover. Samson circled around it, kept his eyes on the ball and pouches it with glee. All of a sudden, {{BOWLER}} finds himself on a hat-trick. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan! UH-OH! Terrific catch, and might I say, there might have been a bit of latent wrath in that angry swipe across the line! Absolutely spanks that, gets it off the inside half towards square leg where Dhawan is quick enough to hold onto a terrific catch! {{BOWLER}} gets {{BATSMAN}}! {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 13(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Chopped on. {{BOWLER}} gets two in two and he's on a hat-trick. It's jitters in the {{TEAM}} camp now as RR are back in the game. Another flop show from {{BATSMAN}} - getting dismissed again for a single-digit score. The top-spinner from {{BOWLER}}, gave more loop and {{BATSMAN}} opted to play it on the off-side staying back in his crease. Goes hard away from the body and gets a thick inside edge which shatters back onto the stumps. {{BOWLER}} is elated. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 8(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Arshdeep Singh!! Third for {{BOWLER}}. What a turnaround by the youngster. He saw {{BATSMAN}} shuffle across and pushed it through quicker, the pull is mistimed and Arshdeep stationed at deep square leg hangs on to a good catch. That ball was up for a long time and the pacer kept his calm to take it. {{TEAM}} have now lost 4 wickets for 13 runs in 2.5 overs. {{BATSMAN}} c Arshdeep Singh b {{BOWLER}} 8(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! Adrenaline rush and {{BATSMAN}} falls. One shot too many for the youngster. Told you, {{BOWLER}} can hoodwink the batsmen with his skiddy short balls, here's the evidence. A short of length that kicks onto {{BATSMAN}}, he looked for a cross-batted smash across the line. Is hurried by the pace and ends up slicing it towards mid-on. Jaddu, the best fielder in the CSK set-up leaps across, times his jump to perfection and pouches the dolly at mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 9(5) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! Royal Challengers Bangalore in trouble as AB {{BATSMAN}} walks back. Was a length ball by {{BOWLER}} and the batsman completely miscued it. Tried to hoick across the line and mistimed it towards mid-wicket where Dhawan takes a comfortable catch. In the battle of two South Africans, it's the younger bloke who comes out on top. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 9(6) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shankar!! Mayank gets greedy there. And he pays the price for it. {{BOWLER}} is so skilfull a bowler that you just can't hit him for consecutive sixes. It was a flighted delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knees and wanted to launch it over deep mid-wicket, fails to connect as well as he would have liked. And ends up gifting a catch to Shankar at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 27(18) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Appeal and umpire Marais Erasmus raises his finger. Oh, the replays suggest it pitched marginally outside leg. But too tough to spot that in real time. {{BATSMAN}} was on the back foot to keep that out. The ball came in off the deck. {{BOWLER}} has that extra pace and which is why he was able to evade the bat of {{BATSMAN}}. Was hit around the knee-roll and Gujarat have got the start they wanted. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 4(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! Quite similar to the previous delivery. Another short delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the pull once again, gets the top-edge too. But this time around it skies up towards short fine leg and Buttler has plenty of time to settle underneath and gulp it down. Second wicket of the match for {{BOWLER}}. Got Rayudu earlier, gets his opening partner now. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 39(31) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Grandhomme!! The Kiwi combination does the trick. The ever-smiling {{BOWLER}} can smile a little more now. {{BATSMAN}} shuffles a long way across his stumps, premeditates the slog straight down the ground and makes a mess of the connection. Outcome? He tumbles after the half-hearted execution and it goes flat and straight to the man at long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c de Grandhomme b {{BOWLER}} 15(10) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Gone. {{BATSMAN}} is quick but not as quick as he was in his international playing days. Even then this single may have been tight. Smeared it to mid-off and ran, hoped Hardik would miss but he didn't. End of story. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Hardik Pandya) 37(25) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Negi!! This was on the cards. {{BATSMAN}} never looked comfortable at the crease and with the required rate shooting up he had no other choice but to go after the spinner. {{BOWLER}} is not afraid of getting hit, he tosses it up generously but gets it to dip on the southpaw, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the slog sweep and miscues it horribly, a much simpler catch for Negi at {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket this time. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Negi b {{BOWLER}} 14(15) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! Has that been taken? It has. Up goes the umpire's finger. End of {{BATSMAN}}'s cameo. Again bowled it full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} threw his bat at it, gets an outside edge and flew to Saha. He flung to his right and pulled off a blinder. Is this the spark that can lighten Punjab back into this game? {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 30(13) [6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mathews!! {{BOWLER}} is on a roll. One more down. What is happening to {{TEAM}}? The skipper departs. The frustration was conspicuous, he wanted to break the shackles. {{BOWLER}} is clever, he bowls one full and gets it to veer away a touch. {{BATSMAN}} slogs wildly across the line, gets a leading edge that balloons in the air towards cover. He gave the charge there. Doesn't matter anyway. Mathews takes a couple of steps backwards and hangs onto it safely. {{BATSMAN}} c Mathews b {{BOWLER}} 14(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Got him! {{BOWLER}} does it again, he has taken wicket off the first over in every game he played. That's some record. {{BATSMAN}} exposes all his stumps looking to cut it square, the quicker one skids on and pings the bails in a flash. {{BATSMAN}} slaps his bat onto his pad as he walks back in disgust. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 15(16) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! This is anticlimactically entertaining. Didn't read the googly at all. Was bowled flat and straight on off, the ball cut in and pinned {{BATSMAN}} in front. He had no clue. Was making room and the ball skid on to pin the back pad. What a good selection he's turning out to be. Big game, so there was every temptation to go for Harbhajan but Rohit persisted with him and see what he's done. Third wicket for just 8 runs. And he has two overs left for goodness sake. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! This doesn't help the Daredevils one bit! {{BOWLER}} strikes with his first ball as well, this was full and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went with hard hands on the drive, the feet went nowhere and the inside edge clattered back onto the stumps. He was their last hope to get past 100 and DD are now struggling for the final push. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 18(25) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! The short ball does it now. The quick short ball, no room for the batter and only musters a top-edge for the keeper to cover some distance and take it at the short third cordon. Back-to-back wickets have almost sealed the game for DC. {{BATSMAN}} could have been the man for {{TEAM}} but not to be. The ball skidded on to him and he was late on the shot. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Woakes Run Out!! 1 run completed. Dangerous thing to take on Smith and Woakes pays the price. {{BATSMAN}} bunts the length delivery to long-on, Smith was quick to swoop down on the ball and released it even quicker. The throw was right on top of the stumps, {{BOWLER}} had got back, collected the throw and light up the stumps. Even a full stretch from Woakes was not enough. Woakes run out (Smith/{{BOWLER}}) 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Big, big wicket for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} makes room and exposes all three stumps. Misses the slog sweep and the ball rattles the middle stump. Punjab will be delighted with this as {{BATSMAN}} would have taken the game further away from Punjab. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 51(27) [4s-4 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Munro Run Out!! The shortish ball skidded on and the batsman trying to pull, gets hit on the pads for the ball to roll away into the on-side. Munro wanted a steal but was sent back. The keeper ran to his left, picked it up and threw it to the bowler, who whipped off the bails. Dreadful start for Delhi. Munro run out (Buttler/{{BOWLER}}) 0(0)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nair!! {{BATSMAN}}'s struggle comes to an end. Probably, a blessing in disguise for Mumbai Indians. Time for Pollard and the Pandya brothers to take charge from here on. Was down on his knee to play the slogsweep as {{BATSMAN}} finds the man at deep mid-wicket. Two contrasting knocks for {{BATSMAN}} then. 99 the other night, and only 28 tonight. More importantly, he has used up too many deliveries in this innings. {{BATSMAN}} c Nair b {{BOWLER}} 28(32) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! {{BATSMAN}} combusts. No tryst with destiny for {{BATSMAN}} today. Top nut from {{BOWLER}}, overcorrects his length and hurls in the sucker ball outside off. {{BATSMAN}} goes for a booming drive sans any feet movement. This was the away curler, he doesn't account for the swing. Ekes out an outside edge that flies to Pant, who dives to his right and completes a fine catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 4(2) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! 143kph bolt -- full, into middle-stump, and {{BATSMAN}}'s aimless swing isn't even close to connecting. Yea, sheer pace, and sheer-er accuracy, going under the bat and making a real mess of the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(12) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} falls sweeping. That was his ploy against spin. He was aware of the dangers associated with it, and was willing to take them anyway. {{BOWLER}}'s googly skids back in sharply and hits him on the knee-roll in front of off and middle. Plumb. What a turnaround this. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 48(31) [4s-6 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}}'s got him the very next ball and he is absolutely pumped. This is serious drama in Bangalore. A beautifully flighted leg-break which drifts in on leg, the ball dips on {{BATSMAN}}, lands away from him as he slogs and sneaks under him. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! The big back-lift probably works to his detriment here. Full at the pads again, the ball slightly stops on him, but due to the velocity at which the bat comes down, he's unable to check the flick shot enough. Chips it off a soft leading edge straight to short mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Bravo b {{BOWLER}} 8(6) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! This is a dream dream over for MI. Now {{BATSMAN}} goes. No real emotions or celebrations from {{BOWLER}}. He is cool amidst all this. But familiar expressions on the {{TEAM}} fans and players's faces. {{BATSMAN}} finds deep mid-wicket with a slog off a slower delivery. No power behind the blow. All three batsmen have expertly found the fielder in this over. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Miller!! Stunned silence at the Wankhede! {{BATSMAN}} falls! Gee, what an anti-climax! The big man thought he had hit another six, the match-winning one but nope, he's found Miller at deep mid-wicket. Was a short ball outside off, had to really fetch it but {{BATSMAN}} rode his luck on the pull. Could only sky it high and not long enough. What a turnaround! {{BOWLER}} could still be the hero. Wowza! {{BATSMAN}} c Miller b {{BOWLER}} 83(31) [4s-3 6s-10]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sam Curran!! {{BATSMAN}} perishes and instantly shadow-practices the execution. It was a cross-seam delivery from Shardul {{BOWLER}} and the length - full - lured {{BATSMAN}} to go for big shot. He looks to slap-drive it over mid-off but doesn't get the timing right, skews it off the thick toe-end and offers catching practice to Curran at mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Sam Curran b {{BOWLER}} 29(21) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chahal!! Gone this time. Can't clear Chahal on this occasion. Was again in the slot from {{BOWLER}} but {{BATSMAN}} didn't get the timing right on the slog. Could only skew it high towards deep mid-wicket where the RCB leggie is waiting for it. Pouches the catch safely and celebrates wildly. VK is also chuffed, as he usually is when he gets excited. RCB are slowly going towards the finish line. {{BATSMAN}} c Chahal b {{BOWLER}} 19(15) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Guptill!! Gone! Another one bites the dust. {{BATSMAN}} hasn't been in the best of touch lately and he departs cheaply today. {{BOWLER}} pushed it through quicker, perhaps {{BATSMAN}} was hustled for pace. Went back and looked to clear deep mid-wicket but messes up with his timing. Skies it straight to Guptill near the rope and he gobbles it up nicely. {{BATSMAN}} c Guptill b {{BOWLER}} 12(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Billings!! Lovely shot - but {{BATSMAN}} has found deep mid-wicket to perfection. This was full and on his pads, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and whips it beautifully - but unfortunately for him, the placement wasn't right. Straight into the hands of Billings and he doesn't drop those. A small contribution from {{BATSMAN}} - but a big wicket under the circumstances for the Daredevils. {{BATSMAN}} c Billings b {{BOWLER}} 16(18) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! No need to appeal for this - a corker from {{BOWLER}} and he has got rid of the {{TEAM}} and India captain - A loose shot from {{BATSMAN}}, another wrong 'un and he didn't read it, lazily pressed forward on the drive - big gap between bat and pad and the ball found its way through, crashed into the off and middle stump and {{BATSMAN}} has to go. Not the most convincing of knocks from the captain - 23 off 25 is plain average at this level. Replays suggested a thin inside edge. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 23(25) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Chahar!! Full toss and out! {{BATSMAN}} shapes up to slog-sweep, gets the timing wrong - courtesy top edge - and Chahar has pulled off a brilliant catch at deep square leg. The leggie moved to his left, and reverse-cupped it. He was very close to the boundary rope and tumbled to complete the catch. Did he touch the boundary rope while tumbling and getting up? The TV umpire has been summoned and he rules it rightly in the favour of the fielding team. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Chahar b {{BOWLER}} 8(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Agarwal!! That's a high catch and Mayank has judged it to perfection at long-off. 'This went to the moon and came back' chirps Danny Morrison on air. {{BATSMAN}} got this one very high and it took an age to come down - but it looked like it didn't have enough legs to clear the fielder, Mayank was the man under it, he held his cool, waited for the ball to arrive and pouched it with both hands. The knuckle ball and {{BATSMAN}} didn't spot, was way too early on the lofted drive - plenty of height but not the distance. {{BATSMAN}} c Agarwal b {{BOWLER}} 7(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! My fingers became numb, so did the atmosphere around the office and in Indore too. Lack of pace foxes {{BATSMAN}}. He picked it late and was through the shot early, the ball cut back in before deflecting off his pads onto the stumps. An absolute gem of a knock from the BigShow. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 40(18) [4s-4 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Southee!! This was on the cards. The pressure was building on and {{BATSMAN}} perishes. Excellent from {{BOWLER}}, kept hitting the right length and forced {{BATSMAN}} into playing a bad shot. Looped up temptingly just outside off, the batsman was early into the loft and didn't go with full conviction. Ended up checking it and offers a sitter to Southee at long-off. Virat roars in delight. Much-needed wicket for RCB, just to lift their spirits. {{BATSMAN}} c Southee b {{BOWLER}} 33(25) [4s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Slower off-cutter, and things don't dip in the slot any better. 2013. 2015. 2017. 2019, you don't mess with Arithmetic progressions and you don't mess with these mathematical Mumbai Indians. {{BATSMAN}} - poor old {{BATSMAN}} - sent ahead of his usual position - walks across his stumps, freezes bang in front of middle looking to flick it across the line. But again, it's the finals, he chokes, misses and is trapped plumb, bang in front of middle. Oh {{BOWLER}}, you really couldn't have redeemed yourself any better. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 2(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pooran!! Pooran makes up for the drop catch and isn't he elated. Does a fist pump after completing the catch. {{TEAM}}'s innings has gone into a downward spiral. {{BATSMAN}} decides he has to go from ball-one and heaves the slower delivery towards wide long-on, Pooran moves to his right and takes a well-judged catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Pooran b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! There's the nail. The unlikeliest of ties is out of the equation too. Quite a half volley this, {{BATSMAN}} can't get under the length though, drills it uppishly, without elevation. This time Dhawan at long-off need not tumble, he can stay and collect. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 8(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Guptill!! Drags the length and gets rewarded. {{BATSMAN}} goes for the slog on this flatter ball, fails to generate enough momentum. Finds one of the tallest members on field stationed at deep mid-wicket boundary. {{BATSMAN}} c Guptill b {{BOWLER}} 74(39) [4s-8 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! {{BOWLER}} has done the double over AB this season. Got him both times. This wicket the credit has to go to Dhawan. What a catch un{{BATSMAN}}r extreme pressure. Could mean a difference of 30 easily. {{BATSMAN}} slogs and doesn't get the elevation, Dhawan at {{BATSMAN}}ep backward square was on the edge, but leapt at the right time, caught it and ensured that the left leg didn't trod on the cushion. He raises his finger Ricky Ponting Sydney style to say it's out. Kohli is anxious and cranes his neck out to check whether this is a legal catch. It is and {{BATSMAN}} walks. Again silence at the Chinnaswamy. 150th wicket for {{BOWLER}} in T20s. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 69(39) [4s-12 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! And call it the text commentator's curse. {{BOWLER}} snuffs out {{BATSMAN}} and Wankhe{{BATSMAN}} erupts. Nothing shot from {{BATSMAN}}. It was full and a semblance of tail back in. The batsman stepped forward and swung, completely down the wrong line and enough gap for the ball to sneak through to knock the off-stump. {{TEAM}} lose their first wicket. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 19(12) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has the last laugh and boy look at him, he's pumped! After bowling a length delivery the left arm pacer comes back strongly to get KP with a slower one. {{BATSMAN}} never really read it and was too early in his shot. Tried to play across the line as the off-cutter went through him and took down the sticks. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 10(7) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Three slower death rattles - {{BATSMAN}} hoodwinks the first two. But the third one lights up Chinnaswamy. Whoa, talk of the ball dipping. Gets it straight on the stumps this time does {{BOWLER}}, gets it slow and right on the base. Nothing that can be done with it but play all around it and Kolkata come to a grinding halt. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Andrew Tye!! Another terrible slog and {{BOWLER}} has three now. Change of pace has done {{BATSMAN}} in, this was a slower ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to slog it over mid-wicket, he has no pace to work with, hit high on the bat and lobs a simple catch to Tye, jogging back from mid-wicket. {{BOWLER}} is on a roll and {{TEAM}}'s batting looks very flaky once again. {{BATSMAN}} c Andrew Tye b {{BOWLER}} 6(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! {{TEAM}} are being spun to the dumps here. {{BOWLER}}'s turn to sneak a wicket now, his second. Wonderfully bowled this, slowed it up and got a bit of drift as well. Lured {{BATSMAN}} into pushing at it and this just straightened a tad to beat the edge. Dhoni has super quick to whip off the bails and as replays showed, the back leg was just on the line. That was never going to be enough. {{TEAM}} sink further .{{BATSMAN}} st Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Uthappa!! {{BOWLER}} has strangled him down leg. What a lucky breakthrough to end a fledgling partnership. Back of a length on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} tries to help it along into the fine leg boundary but the deflection is only a small one. A faint little tickle off the inside edge straight to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 11(6) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has made a mess of {{BATSMAN}}'s stumps. This was pitched on a good length and held its line outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was in no position on the pull - went through with the shot and looked real ugly on replays, gets an inside edge and the ball clatters into the middle-stump. {{TEAM}} have lost an early wicket once again. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! That's a well deserved wicket for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} never looked comfortable against him. This was another full length delivery with away swing written on it, as {{BATSMAN}} tried to flick it away, he got a leading edge to the man at point. Manish wouldn't miss out on that. Another failure for {{BATSMAN}} in his maiden IPL season, second on the trot. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 5(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Off the base of the bat and caught by Surya at deep mid. {{BATSMAN}} is unhappy at himself, screams and then taps the bat onto the helmet in despair. Was a slower delivery and in the slot for the mow over deep mid, but miscued it to the man. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 14(10) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Williamson!! That's it. {{BOWLER}} bags a third as {{BATSMAN}} hits a full toss straight down the throat of long-off. Sunrisers bag their first away win this season. {{BATSMAN}} c Williamson b {{BOWLER}} 15(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Smith!! Gone without scoring. No heroics from {{BATSMAN}} tonight. He takes on a short ball, but doesn't get his timing right on the pull, hits the top-half and Smithy takes a sharp catch diving forward at short mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Smith b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! {{BATSMAN}} gets back into the team and gets a duck on return. Back of a length outside off, just a hint of shape for {{BOWLER}}, nothing great. But this is a bad shot. Plays away from the body looking to run it to third man, only succeeds in nicking it behind. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Abhishek Sharma! {{BOWLER}}ji wins the mind-game. Leg-break just a tad wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for an ill-advised sweep trying to drag it into the on-side, gets a feeble top-edge that lobs into the hands of short fine leg. Mishy is pumped. {{BATSMAN}} c Abhishek Sharma b {{BOWLER}} 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Roy!! Good catch by Roy at long-on and another set {{TEAM}} batsman departs. Got under the full delivery too much - that's why couldn't get the elevation he wanted. It was the knuckle ball as well - something {{BOWLER}} has developed recently, it swings away too, coming to the catch, Roy made it look easy - that's because he judged it to a nicety and took it with both hands without breaking a sweat. {{BATSMAN}} c Roy b {{BOWLER}} 31(29) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Warner!! {{BOWLER}} gets {{BATSMAN}}. Oh that's such a big wicket. {{BATSMAN}} was striking them brilliantly in the last game, and to get him first ball is massive. Should he have taken a bit more time rather than going for the slog first ball? You could argue. But that's how he's been playing so far. {{BOWLER}} does well to get it slightly wide of off and {{BATSMAN}} has to reach out for the slog-sweep. He wants to drag this over mid-wicket, but ends up miscuing to long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Warner b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Akshdeep Nath!! His lack of runs continue. And the first change up of the day - the knuckle ball has an instant reward. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't spot, tries going airy over mid-wicket with his flick. Runs down as well as he does so, closes early, spooning up the leading edge. Only as far as extra cover. And Akshdeep has a calm auspicious start. {{BATSMAN}} c Akshdeep Nath b {{BOWLER}} 9(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Maxwell!! Oh, may I just say that could've hit a plane. A length ball on middle, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track and isn't quite to the pitch of it, gets it off the meat but gets the timing just wrong on the lofted whip which makes it gain more height than distance as Maxwell does phenomenally well to sight the ball and settles under it at deep mid-wicket. Lies out on the grass under the heavens, a relieved man. Made it look much easier than it actually was. That went a kilometer up in the air. {{BATSMAN}} c Maxwell b {{BOWLER}} 50(29) [4s-4 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Plunkett at long-off!! Respite for DD! The {{BATSMAN}} show is over for the night. But boy, what an innings it was! Pure carnage and ruthlessness from the Australian who certainly was at his vintage best. Cleverly bowled by {{BOWLER}} though, flighted it up invitingly, might have been the googly and the lofted stroke went flat towards long-off. Plunkett won't drop those. This is a good passage of play for the Daredevils. They are quietly chipping away at the wickets. {{BATSMAN}} c Plunkett b {{BOWLER}} 78(40) [4s-4 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Is there an edge? Yup, up goes the finger. How fitting is it that it's the combo of {{BOWLER}}-MSD which has capped it off for CSK. Tame surrender this by Delhi. This is their biggest margin of defeat for the season. Coming to the ball, it was another slowish leggie that spun away sharply outside off, {{BATSMAN}} on this occasion gropes at it and nicks it off behind. CSK reclaim the top spot! {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 8(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Brilliant work from Unadkat and {{TEAM}} have lost their third wicket. Exceptional piece of fielding from the Pune pacer, attacked the ball after {{BATSMAN}} had pushed it in front of mid-on. It was {{BATSMAN}}'s call and he comes second best as Unadkat is quick on the ball and makes a direct hit - even as he was sliding onto the ground. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Unadkat) 4(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sarfaraz Khan!! {{TEAM}} have been bowled out for 155. RCB will feel they have done a good job with the ball. This was short and at the stumps, Rahman was backing away on the pull, the ball was just too quick for him, gets a top-edge that lobs behind square on the off-side. de Kock went for the catch, but Sarfaraz called for it and holds on safely. {{BATSMAN}} c Sarfaraz Khan b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by D Kulkarni! When {{BATSMAN}} departs in an away venue, you can hear the combined sound of a city sighing in relief - but at home, you can hear a pin drop. Bangs it in short this time, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it by shuffling across to hook, gets a bit of a top-edge and spoons a catch to Kulkarni at the fine leg boundary! The God of Carnage departs. {{BATSMAN}} c D Kulkarni b {{BOWLER}} 69(37) [4s-9 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Agarwal!! Pacy full ball from {{BOWLER}}, followed the batsman and fired it around the pads, {{BATSMAN}} had made room outside off but the extra pace from {{BOWLER}} skid onto the bat and hit the toe-end on the loft, a simple chance for Mayank at long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Agarwal b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sarfaraz Khan!! KXIP have been bowled out for 155. {{TEAM}} will feel they have done a good job with the ball. This was short and at the stumps, Rahman was backing away on the pull, the ball was just too quick for him, gets a top-edge that lobs behind square on the off-side. de Kock went for the catch, but Sarfaraz called for it and holds on safely. {{BATSMAN}} c Sarfaraz Khan b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Milne!! {{BOWLER}} has his right fist raised in triumph. After getting {{BATSMAN}}. Short ball on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} didn't do enough on the pull and Milne took it over his head at deep square. Just a bit more and that would be six. Kohli is happy as well. A much needed wicket for RCB. {{BATSMAN}} c Milne b {{BOWLER}} 9(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mohit {{BOWLER}}!! Huge wicket this, especially at this stage of the innings. {{BATSMAN}} blasted a 9-ball 38 in the previous game against RPS, coming in at this stage. Short of a length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} pulls, he does not bother to keep it down, was planning to clear the fielder. But since it was off the bottom of the bat, it has no wings to fly over Mohit at deep square. {{BATSMAN}} c Mohit {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 16(8) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hales!! {{BATSMAN}} looks to go big but misses. Was a back of a length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} went at it with hard hands, swung at it only to get a top edge to wide long-off. Hales is the man who settles underneath and takes it. More importantly Pant is back on strike. {{BATSMAN}} c Hales b {{BOWLER}} 9(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! And {{BOWLER}} wins the battle.. Huge wicket at this stage. {{BATSMAN}} shuffled across and aimed to go across the line, {{BOWLER}} cleverly rolled his fingers across the ball, the top-edge went straight up and Pant settled under it. Punjab have kept losing wickets at the wrong time today. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 43(30) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! Full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands at it to carve it over extra-cover. The bat turns in his hands and he eventually slices it straight to deep point. {{TEAM}} are in tatters now. No real firepower to come. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 7(12)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! And again, Imran {{BOWLER}} is on fire. He's just unstoppable at the moment. A canny skidder this, just keeps going with the angle and clatters {{BATSMAN}}'s stumps. He may have got a bit of inside edge there. He wasn't fully forward, neither backward. Poor feet movement. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Is that the game for CSK? Tom Moody looks stunned. An absolute gift of a wicket this. Short and drifting down leg, {{BATSMAN}} senses a boundary-scoring opportunity and gives it a real whack, no bat. It spooned up off the glove and travelled straight into the bucket hands of MS behind the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 24(15) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! This is very good limited overs bowling from {{BOWLER}}. We saw him adjust very well to Dhawan when he was given the charge, now {{BATSMAN}} runs down the pitch to smash the bowler, but {{BOWLER}} takes pace off, shortens the length and also follows the batsman, leaving {{BATSMAN}} nowhere to go. The batsman backs himself to play the pull shot, only mistimes it as far as mid-wicket. A dolly for Watto! {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 24(16) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Christian!! {{BATSMAN}} tries it again and loses his wicket. He will be disappointed with that after being batting so well for his 36. Tries to get under the ball and slog sweep. Wasn't to be. The ball came right of the toe end for Christian to settle under it wide of long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Christian b {{BOWLER}} 36(22) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Beaten by pace, and by the length. Flat and quick from {{BOWLER}}, looked like the flipper which gained pace off a length and went right through {{BATSMAN}} who was in the middle of an attempted pull. Completely misjudged the trajectory. The off stump is knocked over. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 28(31) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Plays it on. And it is the age-old trick of firing in the yorkers that does the trick. {{BATSMAN}} loads himself up for a version of his helicopter. But the ball is just wide enough to kiss the inside edge and ricochet to make a real mess of the timber. A much needed pull back into the contest for RCB - a contest that could well have gone outside the park. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 28(25) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! \"Aaaaah, aaaaah,\" goes {{BOWLER}} and the finger goes up. \"Definitely going over,\" says Pup on air, but quickly corrects himself to add, \"maybe umpire's call.\" Body blow for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} was their hero in Bengaluru, he's out for a 4-ball 1 in Indore. Was that going over the top? Should the benefit of doubt been given to {{BATSMAN}}? This was the nip-backer from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} was on the hop, impact was just around the off stump and hawk-eye shows the ball missing the stumps. Another poor call from the umpire. We've had a few thus far in the series. Ask Mumbai Indians! {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Chopped on! {{BATSMAN}} is livid with himself. It was there to be hit, short and wide but the slowness of the deck, and the lack of bounce does him in. {{BOWLER}} had offered no pace and so, {{BATSMAN}}'s attempted cut stroke results in a big inside edge that disturbs the furniture. {{BOWLER}} is elated, his slower ball menu has finally found success. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! Oh AB. Takes a rocket launched in his direction and makes it look like just another day in office. As clean as it could get. Started off with the ball in the arc for {{BATSMAN}} to smash down. And he obliges. Sinking and spanking it over mid-off. Only for AB at the fence to put his hands up, grab it and avoid the overbalancing. Nothing more. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! This was on the cards. {{BATSMAN}} kept charging down to the spinners without much success, but he didn't stop trying. Shimmies down and {{BOWLER}} being a clever bowler, tosses it up well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} has to reach out for the inside out loft, all he could manage was a slice towards cover-point. Rohit tracks back and takes it over his head while tumbling. Good take that by the MI skipper. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 28(29) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! You can see why {{BOWLER}} is pumped here. Was taken to the cleaners with two back-to-back fours and now comes up with a very full cutter, that skids on and raps {{BATSMAN}} low on the pad. That was as out as the appeal suggested. {{BATSMAN}} was as much beaten by the fullish length as he was by the slowness of the delivery. P-L-U-M-B. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 14(10) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!!Sticky slower bouncer. {{BATSMAN}} attempts running this down to third man with his bat going upside-down, but ends up only getting a tickle ballooning up to the keeper. Pant's hobbling on his right leg as he walks across for the catch, but then smiles. Okay, stop worrying. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Brathwaite!! Gone! Trying to play the big shot, {{BATSMAN}} perishes. It was a slow short ball on the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} spots it and pulls it. He went at it hard and ended up hitting it flat. Brathwaite at deep square leg, stoops low and catches it safely with both hands. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Brathwaite b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Gone. {{BOWLER}} gets his second wicket. A nothing shot from {{BATSMAN}}, a good length delivery that vaults back in a touch, {{BATSMAN}} has a feel for it sans any feet. Gets an inside edge that crashes back onto the stumps. The off-stump goes for a cardio training. {{TEAM}} lose their third. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 8(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! That dropped chance might not hav cost a lot of runs as {{BATSMAN}} is out LBW. {{BOWLER}} nailed the yorker against a rampaging {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} looked to whip it staying deep in his crease and missed it. He was given out LBW and challenged it immediately. But it was three reds. And {{BATSMAN}} had to walk off. Excellent thinking on the part of the young man. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 16(10) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! A miscue from {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} called for the catch and {{BOWLER}} takes the catch - running all the way to mid-wicket. The quicker {{BATSMAN}}livery from the Afghan maestro - was the wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} didn't spot it, was setting himself for the pull and en{{BATSMAN}}d up playing against the turn. A massive top-edge and the ball was in the air for a long time. {{BOWLER}} was always un{{BATSMAN}}r the {{BATSMAN}}livery, watches it keenly and takes it over his shoul{{BATSMAN}}r. End of a fine knowck from the {{TEAM}} opener. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 67(39) [4s-4 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} doesn't review. Plumb in front. Googly from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} got forward to block ala classic Test match style, but he didn't read it too well. Was totally befuddled after he got pinged below the kneeroll. {{BATSMAN}} walks off instantly. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 13(17)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rabada!! Wickets continue to tumble at the Kotla. {{TEAM}} struggling big time in their first away game of the season. {{BOWLER}} bags his second wicket! This was a back of a length delivery down the leg side and {{BATSMAN}} flicks it straight to fine leg. The ball flew of the blade and Rabada in the deep took a well judged catch running to his right. 44/4 stands the score. The crowd at Delhi is lovin' it. {{BATSMAN}} c Rabada b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by {{BATSMAN}}!! Got to be a slower into the pitch and it's done the trick. Maybe {{BOWLER}} won't mind about bowling the extra ball now with the wide call earlier. This was cleverly angled across the left-hander on a good length, {{BATSMAN}} goes for a big slog and gets an edge that goes slowly to {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 24(21) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chawla!! Miss. Miss. Connect. And when he does, it picks out the man in the deep. {{BATSMAN}} refuses to ditch his failed slog sweep from a ball earlier, goes through but {{BOWLER}} very smartly has dragged his length back on this one, making {{BATSMAN}} eventually go one-handed in his followthrough. Miscued severely, to deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Chawla b {{BOWLER}} 11(15) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! And that's a beautiful delivery to get rid of {{BATSMAN}}. He beat him in the air. Lovely change of pace from {{BOWLER}}. The previous ball came at 100kph, this was nicely floated up, {{BATSMAN}} was early into the cut, didn't turn much, anyway was too close to cut and he chops it back onto the sticks off an inside edge. So the ploy to open with {{BOWLER}} works wonders. Disappointment for the {{TEAM}} skipper. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Terrific yorker from {{BOWLER}}; a perfect way to seal wicket no. 100 in the IPL for the veteran pacer. The ball tails back in, zips through {{BATSMAN}} before his bat could come down and plants leg-stump into its grave. {{BOWLER}} on a hat-trick. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Excellent comeback from {{BOWLER}}! Got carted for two biggies but the Afghan lad has held his nerve brilliantly. Saw {{BATSMAN}} give the charge and hung it back a bit in the air. Pulled the length back just a touch and that meant that the wild slog was never really on. {{BATSMAN}} misses and finds the stumps in a mess. Back to back overs where the runs have come but so have the wickets and that's what KXIP will be concerned with as {{TEAM}} bat deep. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 25(19) [6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Markande!! {{BATSMAN}} goes and credit to {{BOWLER}} for that wicket. Slower and loopier, on off, {{BATSMAN}} had to fetch the sweep, can only get a top edge and Markande at square leg almost made a meal of it. Manages to clutch the ball onto his chest and holds on. Important wicket in the powerplay. {{BATSMAN}} c Markande b {{BOWLER}} 12(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Missed a few games? No problem. I know how to nail the yorkers. This is such a difficult art for bowlers, but look at {{BOWLER}}, this is just the second ball of his spell and he's bowled one at 141kph to knock {{BATSMAN}}'s off pole out. The {{TEAM}} captain didn't look comfortable at all and DD will be delighted with that wicket. {{BATSMAN}} was never willing to cover the line against the right-handed pacers, was always looking to back away and open up the off-side. {{BOWLER}} spotted that and outfoxed the batsman with a brilliant yorker. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 30(21) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! Remember what {{TEAM}} did to MI last year at the Wankhede? Well, this is revengeful payback. JUST AS COLD. {{BOWLER}} bangs it in, continues cramping {{BATSMAN}} up for room, for height as he continues swinging desperately -- this time for the bat face to turn in his palms, get a big fat top-edge, as far as mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 11(14) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Boult!! That is so poor from DK. No game awareness at all. Switched off at the wrong moment and didn't spot the change in field. Flicks and holes out to deep mid. Went for the same shot that got him two boundaries, but found the fielder. {{BOWLER}} raises his arms in delight and sports a big smile on his face. Had his man finally. {{BATSMAN}} c Boult b {{BOWLER}} 19(10) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! A high full toss at 139.4kph, and is {{BATSMAN}} is out caught-and-bowled? The umpires send it upstairs. It's below the waist and {{BATSMAN}} has to walk back. This is a big wicket. A full toss just below the waist from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} was initially looking to run it down to third man and later decided to work it into the on-side. In the end, the ball lobbed up off the splice of the bat. He was taken aback by the full toss. A simple return catch for Dre Russ. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 51(38) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina! GONE! Let the DJ's party begin. Off he goes, on his turntable - a yorker length delivery on off, {{BATSMAN}} tries getting under his, with the bottom-hand dominating, scoops it, gets his wrists over it, and Raina is waiting at cover - straight to him, and he holds on to yet another low catch today. A pressure catch! A key wicket, this, and this is going to be interesting. Surely, not another late-night/early-morning super-over. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 46(26) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Simmons Run Out!! Oh, unlucky! Knuckle ball straight at the stumps, PP hits it back the bowler who manages to get some finger after stretching his right hand, it bounces and knocks the bails before crashing into the stumps. Simmons was backing up too far and was caught napping. Wasn't even in the frame. Simmons run out ({{BOWLER}}) 5(13)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Klaasen!! And does him next ball. {{BOWLER}} retaliates. Sticks to his strengths. Keeps it short and cramps {{BATSMAN}} for room and space. {{BATSMAN}} was backing away, in a bid to slash it through point. Is defeated by the extra bounce and zip. Gets a faint nick and Klaasen nestles it in his gloves. The partnership has been broken and {{TEAM}} lose half their side. {{BATSMAN}} c Klaasen b {{BOWLER}} 28(17) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rayudu!! Holes. Predictable lines from {{BOWLER}}, short-outside off and predictable from {{BATSMAN}}, swinging and aiming for the Western Railway trains outside. The pitch steals some timing, gets his toe-end and a running long-on cleans up. {{BATSMAN}} c Rayudu b {{BOWLER}} 21(11) [6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Piyush has broken through the dangerous opening stand, {{BATSMAN}} falls after a fine hand. This was the wrong 'un from Piyush, {{BATSMAN}} didn't read it, backed away on the cut, the ball kept spinning back into him, cramped him for space, gets the under-edge and the ball goes on to crash into the leg-stump. Piyush gives him a send-off, but {{BATSMAN}} has done his job. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 38(23) [4s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! He's played on. Big blow for Delhi up front. Short of length from {{BOWLER}}, hits the pitch hard and rushes {{BATSMAN}} on the pull. It was there to be put away, the height didn't seem an inconvenience, but I think what unraveled {{BATSMAN}} was the skid on the ball. He's late on the shot and under-edges it into the furniture. Middle stump floored. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 10(7) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Wicket off the first ball of the over and {{BATSMAN}} has to take the long walk back. Shortish ball from NCN, {{BATSMAN}} comes forward and looks to go downtown. Ends up slicing it miles up in the air. Yadav, at long-on takes it calmly. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 22(17) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! Two wickets in the over and {{BOWLER}} is on a roll. The wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} has been done in completely. He has a word with his partner, but decides against a review, off he goes. Is this the game turning over? Coming to the ball, this was nicely tossed up around off, {{BATSMAN}} prodded forward on the drive, but unlike the previous ball - he didn't get to the pitch of it. The bat hit the ground, the ball caught the outside edge and Karthik completes a fine catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 3(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! Oh my word! There's that customary stunner from Pollard for the season. His batting form may have dipped but not his fielding and catching. This is smart field placement from Rohit and {{BOWLER}} executed it well. Dug it short and offered width, {{BATSMAN}} forgets there's a fielder at sweeper cover. Slashed it on the up and Pollard was waiting for it. Though he kind of charged in a bit early, he made sure he kept his calm and stretched his giant right hand to nonchalantly grab it. Dives and thumps his chest towards the MI fans in the stands. Blinder from the big man and {{TEAM}} in trouble now. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 16(15) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Knocked him over. An ordinary shot from the DD captain. It was bowled at 139.5kph and {{BATSMAN}} was backing away to cut. It was neither short nor wide. A skiddy short of length delivery on off. {{BATSMAN}} can't make contact and the ball crashes into the off-pole. Beaten for pace. The partnership has been broken. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 19(22) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by D Kulkarni!! {{BATSMAN}} perishes trying to play a good shot. {{BOWLER}} banged it in short at 132kph and {{BATSMAN}} went through with his pull shot despite not being in a good position to play it. The top-edge balloons up and settles into the safe hands of long-on. He went too hard and in the process lost his shape. {{BATSMAN}} c D Kulkarni b {{BOWLER}} 27(16) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Edged and caught - A straightforward dismissal and the Super Kings are pulling things back nicely. Two wickets in the over for {{BOWLER}} - shortened his length and angled one across the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to run it past the keeper, got it too fine though and MS did the rest - dived across to his right and the ball got stuck in his fingertips, he clasped it cleanly on the second attempt. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 6(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} has to go. Outrageous attempt from him. Got a long way across to help the sweep over the infield on the on-side. Missed it completely and the ball crashed the bails. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 28(20) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Wow! What a reply from {{BOWLER}}. He did not like the six for sure. Comes back with a peach of a yorker and as Mr Gavaskar informs us this was around 27.4kph quicker than the previous ball - 115kph. A yorker on the legs, too tough to negotiate. {{BATSMAN}}'s bat comes down late and he deflects it off his leg to the off-pole. {{BOWLER}} is delighted. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 34(20) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! There comes Nepal on a scoreboard -- you've officially been inducted. Sandeep after being smacked down gets it quicker, fuller, on middle. {{BATSMAN}} done in for the length, it's just not there to be sweeping, but he tries, misses, and finds himself struck plumb. A rewind of his fall in Pune. Doesn't even bother considering a review, walks, quickly. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 6(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chahal!! The {{BATSMAN}} show is over! This looked like a certain six, but the timing wasn't spot on, Chahal - at deep square leg, watches it all along and makes sure that he didn't step onto the ropes. A big wicket for RCB. Nicely bowled by {{BOWLER}} as well, shortened the length, rolled his fingers across the seam and made {{BATSMAN}} manufacture all the power. He did so, but was just short enough to clear the ropes. That's also the 50th T20 wicket for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Chahal b {{BOWLER}} 34(17) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Milne!! There's the breakthrough! {{BATSMAN}} perishes to a full toss. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to sweep and gets a top edge that lobs up towards short fine leg. Milne, runs back, and gobbles it up with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Milne b {{BOWLER}} 6(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by A Russell!! Russell takes a calm catch just in front of the boundary rope. The quick wrong 'un that zipped through and {{BATSMAN}} gave a mighty heave. Doesn't get the required elevation and Dre Russ snaffles it at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c A Russell b {{BOWLER}} 24(9) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! The partnership has been broken. If you wanted someone from the GL team to be under this skier, it would be Raina. Short of a length and on off, {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull and the top-edge goes straight up, keeps swirling and almost kisses the night sky before coming down, Raina from mid-wicket, called for it, removed his cap to get a good sighter and then reverse cupped it safely. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 33(28) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. {{TEAM}} have lost four wickets and Rashid Khan is yet to bowl. 4 overs of him remaining. This was a suicidal second by DK and he's livid with himself. Had flicked the flatter delivery to deep mid-wicket and two was the call straightaway. He decides to take on one of the best fielders in SRH's team though. Shankar charges in towards the ball, gathers it neatly and gets rid of the ball in the blink of an eye. Bairstow collects the ball and takes down the bails and DK's dive ain't enough as he's well short of the crease. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Shankar/Bairstow) 6(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shami!! {{BOWLER}} removes {{BATSMAN}}. Finally, a wicket for KXIP which should give them some lift. Wasn't that great a delivery from {{BOWLER}}. Rifled it quick - the carrom ball and down leg, {{BATSMAN}} tried to be cheeky and thought of helping it over the man at 45. But he didn't get the required timing to clear the fielder and hits it to Shami at short fine leg, who clings onto it. First wicket for {{BOWLER}} and let's see if they can put the brakes from here. {{BATSMAN}} c Shami b {{BOWLER}} 36(25) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! He plays such unorthodox shots but falls prey tonight. Looked to slog a slower delivery and missed it completely. The impact looked a little dicey at first but was umpire's call as {{BATSMAN}} decided to review. SRH are on top now. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 7(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! You miss, I hit! CSK needed this and Chepauk finds its voice. Flat ball lasered in on the stumps at 92kph, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track and is beaten in the trajectory. Looked to hack across the line and the ball just sneaked through the gap between bat and pad. Crashes into the leg pole. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 22(16) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Just top skills. The field was set for a yorker -- long-off, long-on, deep mid-wicket. But Kumar does the double bluff, going for the quick bouncer. {{BATSMAN}} meanwhile had himself committed to his front foot, and by the time he can rock back and look to pull, has the ball going over comfortably. Anyway, then he decides to step out for the single and doesn't even bother getting back in after getting nothing from Philippe as Bairstow runs to the stumps to whip the bails off. Okay, 163 then .. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Bairstow) 7(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Some really smart bowling. {{BATSMAN}} gives away his cards early, running down the pitch even before {{BOWLER}} gets into his delivery stride - allowing him all the time to fire it short and well outside off. Obvious miss, sneaking under the bat and Pant's gloves almost outdo Dhoni. {{BATSMAN}} st Pant b {{BOWLER}} 30(27) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Miller!! There's the wicket that KXIP were looking for. Precisely why {{BOWLER}} was brought on, in this over. Not a wicket-taking ball, was actually in the slot but was pacy from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} didn't get hold of it. Never really got going tonight to be honest and the miscue finds a gleeful Miller at long-on. Dolly it is and that's the end of HP. {{BATSMAN}} c Miller b {{BOWLER}} 19(13) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Needless review from {{BATSMAN}} and he has to go. Pinpoint yorker from {{BOWLER}} and the Australian couldn't get his bat down on time. Pinned on the back pad and it rolled towards short fine leg. Umpire Nandan was quick to raise his finger and so was {{BATSMAN}} to signal the T. That suggested that perhaps he might have got some bat on it but no, replays clearly show he hadn't and the rest is just a formality. Three Reds on HawkEye. It's started to rain as well!!! Could well be the end of the innings. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 5(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jayant Yadav!! Brilliant catch! Jayant is the man at mid-on and he had to go with his back to the ball. Such catches are never easy but he made it look effortless. Once again a wicket due to poor shot selection, the partnership was budding and {{BATSMAN}} opts for a pull off the back foot. Against the turn and ends up mistiming it down the ground. Wasn't in control and perishes. Pressure mounts on {{TEAM}}! {{BATSMAN}} c Jayant Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 10(13) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! Something for the 18000 kids to cheer about. {{BOWLER}} has provided the breakthrough. {{BATSMAN}} has been asked to wait by Ravi. The front leg is fine. Legal delivery that and Ravi raises his finger. The back of the hand slower ball dug in short, {{BATSMAN}} takes it on and top edges it to deep square leg. Krunal misjudged it for a second, but recovered well to pouch it. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 11(14) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Excellent return catch from {{BOWLER}}. Ensured he didn't offer any room to {{BATSMAN}} there, bowled it on a length and extracted some zip off the pitch; {{BATSMAN}} had nowhere to go, went flat and hard, ended up splicing it straight to {{BOWLER}} who bent down to claim a clean, low catch. {{BOWLER}} is pumped and so is CSK. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 12(9) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Harbhajan!! {{BOWLER}} does run this time, but only halfway of the ground. Two in two and how quickly has this game turned. Googly, on a punching length, but it turns just a wee bit more than {{BATSMAN}} expected, catches the edge and surprisingly there's a slip in for the Kiwi at this stage. Another masterstroke by MS and Bhajji is only too happy to gobble it up. Again what emotion and what drama at the Chinnaswamy. {{BATSMAN}} c Harbhajan b {{BOWLER}} 2(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! Gone. {{BATSMAN}}'s knock comes to an end. Flat from {{BOWLER}}, following {{BATSMAN}} as he backs away, cramps him up a touch and he miscues the pull straight to long-on. But what a knock it's been. He's blown RCB away. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 72(34) [4s-5 6s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Knocked him over! {{BOWLER}} is pumped up. Another failure for {{BATSMAN}}. 147.6kph, {{BATSMAN}} is expecting a short ball, the bowler smartly bowls a length ball. The left-handed batter backs away in an attempt to hoick across the line. Too quick for him though. Gets beaten on the inside edge and the ball hits the top of leg. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The zing bails light up and then there's the jig from {{BOWLER}}. Perfect yorker from the West Indian, {{BATSMAN}} slightly moved leg-side to create room. He is too late to bring his bat down and the ball crashes into the middle stump. {{TEAM}} in deep trouble here - 80/5! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 24(22) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! End of {{BATSMAN}}'s painful innings. No feet and he is bowled off a thick inside edge onto pad and then falls on the off-stump. {{BOWLER}} is absolutely thrilled to bits. Shouting and screaming in delight. Length delivery on off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward to drive, is late on the shot and the rest is history. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Shardul {{BOWLER}} has been terrific with his lengths and variations today. Bowls the cross-seam delivery and pitches it much shorter than it did against Gill. A similar dismissal though. {{BATSMAN}} looks to go over mid-wicket with a cross-bat swipe and sends a crisp edge through to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Bravo!! Rajasthan Royals lose their best batter and are in deep trouble. A fuller-than-a-good-length ball on the stumps and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to bash it over mid-on. The ball might have held up into the wicket and that robbed the batter's timing. The bat turned at the point of impact and {{BATSMAN}} ended up slicing it over mid-off. Bravo takes a couple of steps backwards and snaffles it with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Bravo b {{BOWLER}} 6(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! The gamble has worked for Kohli. Gives the ball to {{BOWLER}}, who tosses it up, the batsman takes the aerial route but gets more elevation than distance and ends up being caught at long-off. That again went very high but ABD was all calm under the ball and cupped it without any fuss. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 70(47) [4s-3 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Rahul Tewatia!! Is that the game? Ishan Kishan thinks so as he has his hands on his head. One of the {{TEAM}} cheerleaders did not like {{BATSMAN}}'s shot selection either. Needless from {{BATSMAN}}. Last over for {{BOWLER}} and he should have tried to play him out, but that is not the sort of batsman he is. Saw the floaty delivery outside off and went for the big loft downtown, sliced it off the outer half to backward point, where Tewatia picks up his second catch. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Rahul Tewatia b {{BOWLER}} 27(17) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! The scratchy knock from the youngster comes to an end. He never looked comfortable in his brief stay. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't spot the off-cutter and is early to swipe it across the line. The top edge balloons up high in the air. Sheyas Iyer, from long-on, runs forward and takes a good skier. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! The partnership is broken and {{BATSMAN}} is dismissed. It's the googly from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} looks to work it through the on-side, but fails to make connection as the ball sneaked past the inside edge. Pitched outside off, impact on off, hitting off and middle, confirms HawkEye. Loud cheers, not for the wicket. MS is walking in. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 56(43) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} walks across his sticks and misses the clip to be clean bowled. Quick yorker and {{BATSMAN}} was late on it. The leg pole was pegged back. The pressure of 3 dot balls got to {{BATSMAN}} and he tried something different. {{BOWLER}} had been bowling the wicket-to-wicket channel and slips in the yorker to out do the batter. Silence prevails at Wankhede. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 15(13) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! A game of angles, nothing else folks. You would think how on earth did a set batsman of {{BATSMAN}}'s ability not muscle that juicy full ball over the ropes. but there's a lot on the technical side in this game. {{BATSMAN}} took the invitation without knowing there was trap, he swung too hard and lost a bit of shape which is why he couldn't find the middle. Edge to QdK who takes a simple catch. A lot of times people wonder why Cottrell and not Jordan in a team. It's all about the angles. Left-arm angle to right-handeed batsman isn't all that easy. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 44(27) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Clever from Jaddu. Bowled the arm-ball and managed to beat the inside edge. {{BATSMAN}} expected it to be around off-stump and poked at it without much conviction, the ball dips short of him and smashes the leg bail. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(3) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Boult!! This time, Faf holes out! He struggled to get going barring a couple of boundaries and finally, perishes in a bid to up the ante. Fuller ball and a bit wide outside off, he tried to go over the man at long-off but didn't middle this at all. Easiest of catches for Boult near the ropes. Finally the partnership is broken and DD will want to drag things back a bit now. Won't be easy though as there is some serious firepower to come for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Boult b {{BOWLER}} 33(33) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Nair!! Rush of blood! {{BOWLER}}'s done him with the googly, this time {{BATSMAN}} gave himself plenty of room and wanted to go over long-on, hasn't quite middled it and picks out the sub fielder Karun Nair in the deep. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Nair b {{BOWLER}} 6(2) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rayudu!! Shardul {{BOWLER}} has the last laugh. MS applauds. A horror shot from {{BATSMAN}}, though. After hitting three successive boundaries, {{BATSMAN}} tries to play another biggie. He hung back and wanted to thump it downtown - this short of length delivery - similar to the shot he played off Chahar. But, this time, Jos lost his shape in the process and the ball ballooned up a long way off the top part of the bat. Rayudu settles under it at the extra cover region and snaffles with both hands. The danger man has thrown his wicket away here. {{BATSMAN}} c Rayudu b {{BOWLER}} 23(10) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Vijay Shankar!! The adrenaline rush from {{BATSMAN}}, was never going to clear long-on. The googly from {{BOWLER}}, skidded off the surface and {{BATSMAN}} was on the back foot. In a bid to unleash his bottom-handed whip, mistimes, gets a leading edge and picks out Vijay Shankar, who sprinted forward and tumbles. Importantly holds onto it. Sandeep roars, for he gets his revenge. {{BATSMAN}} c Vijay Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 12(4) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Needed something special to get rid of {{BATSMAN}} and Iyer has pulled off a stunner. Dhawan pats the Kiwi on the back as he trudges off. It has been a high quality innings from {{BATSMAN}}. First opportunity and he's grabbed it with both hands. Good length ball on off, {{BATSMAN}} maintains a low base to hoick it into the leg-side, gets more of a leading edge towards deep mid-wicket. Iyer from deep square leg covers good ground, dives full length and clings on. Made it look easy did the Mumbaikar. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 89(51) [4s-6 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Duminy!! Not quite to the pitch of the ball as he dances down, goes through with the loft nonetheless and lobs it off the inside half to long-on. {{BOWLER}} gets on the wickets column as {{TEAM}} lose their ninth. {{BATSMAN}} c Duminy b {{BOWLER}} 18(17) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! Cutting away, this slower full ball, and lobs off the cue-end to short third man. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to go big downtown but hey, this is Mumbai, with its pace all sold off to neighbouring pitches, you feel. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 12(11) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Simmons!! This is not how you climb a Mt Everest. This is not the start you dream of. A fuller ball and {{BATSMAN}} swings across the line. Wants to dominate with ball one. The bat turns a bit in the hands, taking the power off the shot. Carries to the man at deep square leg. The fielder moves a bit to his right and grabs that with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Simmons b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gayle!! Chris Gayle is claiming a catch and the replays suggest it is O-U-T. {{BATSMAN}}'s struggles continue. Dropped short and ripped away from {{BATSMAN}}'s reach, he goes for the cut and slashes it hard in front of backward point and guess who? It's the Universal Boss, Chris Gayle. Dives full length and nestles it inches above the turf. Good reflexes. {{BATSMAN}} c Gayle b {{BOWLER}} 5(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chawla!! In the air and taken. Brilliant catch by PC, he charged back from mid-on, kept his eye on the ball and takes a beauty. It was a flighted delivery wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to loft it over long-on, it comes off the bottom half of the willow and goes a long way up in the air. And PC there did exactly what the KKR wanted him to do in the outfield. {{BATSMAN}} c Chawla b {{BOWLER}} 14(13) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mandeep!! Another time-out. Another wicket. A sure shot strategy uncovered when things seem to be going the way of the batsmen. A perfectly disguised 107kph back of the hand stuff and {{BATSMAN}} after being made to wait swings his bat going for the uppish flick. Miscues and the ball doesn't even have the pace to go all the way. Picks out the lone man at deep mid-wicket to perfection. {{BATSMAN}} c Mandeep b {{BOWLER}} 18(21) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! And gone! Rajasthan have their man. {{BATSMAN}} cannot believe it as he walks back with both his hand along with the bat over his head. KKR in trouble now with half the side back in the dugout. There was a plan and {{BOWLER}} has bowled to it. Third man was up, deep backward point was in place and a deep extra cover. {{BOWLER}} went for the wide yorker and even nailed it, {{BATSMAN}} bends down and slices it straight to Unadkat at deep backward point. That was right off the meat but the long boundaries did not help him there. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 24(14) [6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! Rohit takes the catch and signals to the umpire to check upstairs. He is not sure. Soft signal is out. Good low catch at mid-wicket by Rohit. Slugged by {{BATSMAN}} and taken near his bootlaces. Looks like the fingers are un{{BATSMAN}}r the ball. Let's wait for the third umpire's call. Who is having a look from different angles. Should be given out I guess. OUT it is. {{BOWLER}} strikes and the pressure has told on {{BATSMAN}}. He was struggling and has ma{{BATSMAN}} his way back. Didn't get enough elevation on this hit. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 7(13) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Harbhajan Run Out!! School boy stuff from Harbhajan. He doesn't slide the bat in and hence pays the price. {{BOWLER}} does not offer any width to {{BATSMAN}}, spears it in the blockhole, an inside edge hits the pad and drops on the pitch. Harbhajan calls for the run and he forgets to slide the ball. Good footballing skills from {{BOWLER}}, runs forward and kicks the ball onto the stumps. If he had slid his bat in, Harbhajan might have survived. Harbhajan run out ({{BOWLER}}) 2(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! That is a case of not realizing the importance of the wicket and attempting to send everything out of the park. Is a flighted delivery outside off and {{BATSMAN}} tries to loft over long-off. Gets off the bottom part of the bat and the RCB captain does not have to move much at the fence. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 7(3) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Very loose. Just not what you'd expect at this stage. Teases him with a wide fuller length delivery does {{BOWLER}} enticing the drive. {{BATSMAN}} cannot resist. Throws his hands out and chases it with a drive. Gets a fat outside edge in the process and this time Dhoni doesn't even have to dive. Pune are tired of their celebrations as well. Just smiles around. The 100th dismissal for Dhoni this. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 22(20) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Full ball on off, {{BATSMAN}}'s loft is a mistimed one, and it's taken comfortably by long-off running in. Probably didn't need to press the trigger so early. {{BATSMAN}} c Shubman Gill b {{BOWLER}} 18(9) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has struck. A fierce short of length delivery which skids on, keeps a bit low and nips back in from round the wicket. {{BATSMAN}} makes room once more and has a slash at it but he's played over the ball by six inches at least. It pummels the off-stump. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 18(17) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hetmyer!! {{BATSMAN}} walks straight into the trap set by Iyer and Co. For a second, I thought Hetmyer misjudged it by running in too far, but he keeps his calm and holds onto it. Another game, another instance of {{TEAM}} losing an early wicket. {{BATSMAN}} will be kicking himself there, couldn't have placed it any better. A short delivery begging to be hit, {{BATSMAN}} jumped back and pulled it uppishly, didn't have the power to clear the fielder at deep mid-wicket. Very poor.. Patel is pumped. {{BATSMAN}} c Hetmyer b {{BOWLER}} 14(16) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Third wicket for {{BOWLER}}! The slower ball does the trick again. The cutter at 114.4kph, it was actually in the slot, but {{BATSMAN}} couldn't generate enough power with his big-swing of the bat. Holes out at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Johnson!! In the air and taken at long-on. Two wickets in two overs for KKR, they are plotting a turnaround here. Both set batsmen dismissed. Well-flighted delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} grounds his knee and smacked it - skews it off the toe-end - finds long-on. It was in the slot but {{BATSMAN}} couldn't connect it well. {{BATSMAN}} c Johnson b {{BOWLER}} 31(26) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! You don't need to be a genius at this. Anyone can see that {{BATSMAN}} has no chance against the swinging and pacy {{BOWLER}}. Especially at the death. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get in line, just stands outside leg and wafts his bat through the line. The late reverse swing takes the leg stump out and sends it out of its groove. That's clinical execution at the death. Perhaps the best exponent with the ball when bowling at the end in the world. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Celeb appeal and the umpire's finger goes up for LBW. Think DK was happy to go, but he then chatted with his partner and decided to review. Pretty sure the 15-second time gap had elapsed, but here we go. It's a fair delivery and there's no inside edge on that. Was the wrong 'un and DK didn't read it one bit. UltraEdge confirms that there's no bat on that, Hawk-Eye in and it's three REDS. {{BATSMAN}} is OUT and {{TEAM}} have wasted their review. Lovely delivery from {{BOWLER}}, slipped in the wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} didn't spot it - ended up playing outside the line as he lunged forward. Past the inside edge and struck adjacent to middle, was going on and crashing into the middle-stump. SRH keep themselves in the hunt with timely wickets. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by S Kaul!! The slower ball works...{{BOWLER}} persists with the same tactic, he fires it around off and middle denying all the room {{BATSMAN}} wanted. He lifts the stroke off the upper half and chips it straight to Kaul mid-on. Simple catch. {{BATSMAN}} c S Kaul b {{BOWLER}} 3(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by A Russell!! This has gone high, not long. Russell pedals back from extra-cover, and takes a really good catch falling backwards. Good finish to the over from {{BOWLER}}. Another full and wide delivery which is skied off the toe-end by {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c A Russell b {{BOWLER}} 5(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Pant Run Out!! If there is one IPL game Pant never wants to revisit, this could be the one. He looked completely off today and his running explains everything. {{BATSMAN}} knocked this towards mid-wicket and took a default sprint trying to sneak a single, Pant though was in a different planet. Doesn't even bat an eye at the field and just jogs blindly towards the batting end. The fielder at mid-wicket was sharp and he quickly threw it to the bowler who completed the formalities. Pant tried to get back, but he wasn't even in the frame. Pant run out ((sub)Vohra/{{BOWLER}}) 5(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Wow. What moment for Punjab. Third wicket for them in no time. Two in two for {{BOWLER}}. Floats it on the stumps and the new man tries to work across the line. Is beaten in the air and closes the bat face too early. The ball evades the willow and thuds him low on the pad. The umpire obliges the appeal to sink Gujarat's hopes further. Hat-trick ball coming up. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shubman Gill!! It will twist, ever so slowly, but it will twist. Short, skiddy, heaved, and it's straight down deep mid-wicket's throat. The favourites have turned, clearly. {{BATSMAN}} c Shubman Gill b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! {{BOWLER}} is having fun here at the death. Gets this third and this is another canny delivery. After a series of fullish balls, he drags back the length and takes all the pace off this one. {{BATSMAN}} was shuffling across for the slog but this got big on him. All he managed was to sky it towards deep mid-wicket. Stokes won't drop those. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by A Russell!! That brings an end to {{BATSMAN}}'s belligerence. That was some knock! He set Edens on fire! Goes hard at a slower short delivery and mistimes it to deep mid-wicket. Dre Russ is the man who gets under the skier and takes the catch safely. A round of applause for {{BATSMAN}} who walks back to the pavilion after playing a quality knock. {{BATSMAN}} c A Russell b {{BOWLER}} 91(34) [4s-6 6s-9]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rabada!! Flat, short, angling in, cramping out room. Yep, you've read this before. This is bang in {{BOWLER}} Patel's territory, his mastery. {{BATSMAN}} goes on the back foot, clears his front leg, swats across the line, and miscues it away into square leg somewhere. Rabada probably loses the ball, or maybe he's just late to pick it up, but never mind, he's moved quickly to his right, dived, stuck his hands out, and gotten it to stick. {{BATSMAN}} c Rabada b {{BOWLER}} 6(6) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Negi!! This is a big wicket! {{BOWLER}} strikes. Flat, quick and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} had to reach out and he tried to go over extra cover. The ball lobs up off the outside half. Negi settles under it at backward point and gobbles it up. {{BATSMAN}} c Negi b {{BOWLER}} 28(13) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nitish Rana!! Goes for the slog sweep, gets a top-edge and Rana at short cover calls for it and takes it. That was unneccesary. May be at the break they decided one of them will go for it but this hasn't worked for {{TEAM}}. Is the game still alive? Too tough for KKR. {{BATSMAN}} c Nitish Rana b {{BOWLER}} 21(31) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Knocked him over and Gambhir shakes his head. {{BOWLER}} is over the moon. Nipped in off the surface, {{BATSMAN}} was late in getting his bat down and the insi{{BATSMAN}} edge rattled back on. That turns the game again. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 29(16) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! They are crumbling like nine pins. One after the other. There's no room to breathe. Knuckle ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} played across the line and got hit in line with middle and leg. Loud appeal and given out straightaway. {{BATSMAN}} went for the review after a brief consultation with his skipper, thankfully they didn't lose the review. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 4(2) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Hoodwinked by the wrong 'un. No heroics from {{BATSMAN}} then, who stormed to IPL's fastest fifty at this very ground in the league stage. Shimmies out ambitiously but {{BOWLER}}'s bowling in the powerplay for a reason. Sees him doing that, bowls a tossed-up googly and gets him stumped. Easy take for the keeper and a disparaging flick of the bails. {{BATSMAN}} st Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 10(10) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Uthappa!! The wickets tumble. And so does the {{TEAM}} line-up. What on earth is going on? The banana peel that KKR were subject to seems to have slipped into the {{TEAM}} territory. A 147kph bolt here. Bang on the money, short, climbing up and too quick on the pull. The compulsive AB pull. Goes sky high with the top edge and Uthappa almost makes a meal of the grab behind the stumps. Moves all around and settles just about un{{BATSMAN}}r it. {{BATSMAN}} c Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 8(6) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! .. and {{BOWLER}} strikes with his first ball. A different day and some different results already. {{BATSMAN}} was struggling to get a move, doesn't spot the leg-break, lunged forward on the sweep and missed, to make things worse - he slipped as he tried to get back into the crease. Saha whipped the bails off with {{BATSMAN}} well outside the crease, Anil Chaudhary doesn't need the help of the third umpire, off he goes, a poor start for {{BATSMAN}} in IPL 2018. {{BATSMAN}} st Saha b {{BOWLER}} 11(13) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! {{BOWLER}} is on a roll! This was a lovely leg-break from {{BOWLER}}, teased {{BATSMAN}} into coming down the track, he doesn't get to the pitch of the ball, looks to force it away through cover and ends up getting a thick edge to Kohli at first slip. The RCB captain swallows it and {{TEAM}} fall further into trouble. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rayudu!! Ends a troubled stay. Without getting his timing right, {{BATSMAN}} tries an uppish loft. Doesn't bother moving his feet though. Doesn't bother reaching out as well. Doesn't even bother to read the slower one. Stands, swings, toe-ends and mid-off does the rest. Kolkata innings falling apart. More to their own self-ignition. {{BATSMAN}} c Rayudu b {{BOWLER}} 2(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Y Pathan!! {{BATSMAN}} falls and KKR have struck early. A nothing shot from the England opener. This was another long hop from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} rocked back on the pull, didn't go through with the shot completely - was perhaps just looking to help it on its way, gets a fat top-edge, high and over mid-wicket. Yusuf ran back and completed an easy catch. {{BATSMAN}} looks gutted as he walks off. {{BATSMAN}} c Y Pathan b {{BOWLER}} 14(12) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! It swings one way, and then the other. {{BOWLER}} hits back with a vengeance. A good length delivery which is in the slot for the slog, but the ball nips in just a touch to cause the error from {{BATSMAN}}. He chops it back on off an inside edge. The crowd is right in this. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! Oh Stokesy. If not with the bat, he changes the game with the ball. If not with the ball he does it with his diving arounds. {{BATSMAN}} slaps this fullish ball hard. And doesn't bother keeping it down as well. Only for Stokes to run across from the extra cover boundary and dive to pluck it inches off the turf. Is that the game? They've crossed over mind you. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 13(11) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Gone! {{BOWLER}} has the big wicket and he's unstoppable. He goes off on a run like Tahir. Perfect start for CSK. {{TEAM}}'s lynchpin is sent back early. Good length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drives without accounting for the swing and the outside edge is found, Dhoni dives to his right and takes it safely. That is the area to bowl to {{BATSMAN}} in whatever format - on a good length and outside off. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 9(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Maxwell Run Out!! Sharp from {{BOWLER}}! Was quick to gather this in his followthrough from Karthik's throw and threw the stumps down at the bowler's end. Maxwell was backing away for the single and was never going to make it back. Slow off cutter outside off, {{BATSMAN}} tried to slog across the line but only got a bottom edge towards Karthik. Maxwell wanted the bye but in the end, had to go. Maxwell run out (Karthik/{{BOWLER}}) 27(18) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Edged and taken! Full and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard at it and gets an outside edge to the keeper. Quality over by {{BOWLER}} so far. Things getting tougher with every delivery for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 27(19) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} was chatting with Williamson regarding the review but umpire says time is up and {{BATSMAN}} will have to depart. It was a flighted delivery which turned in after pitching, {{BATSMAN}}'s bat was behind the pads and ball raps him on the pads. It looked adjacent, the only question was whether it was going down the leg-side. Umpire thinks it wasn't and he raises his finger slowly in a stylish manner. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 4(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shivam Mavi!! Better from {{BOWLER}}. More the area he needs to bowl. This is right up there, near to yorker length, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in the crease and plays the helicopter, but doesn't get enough to clear long-on, Mavi does not have to move much as he takes a simple chance. A perfect cameo from {{BATSMAN}} but he would have wanted to bat a bit longer. {{BATSMAN}} c Shivam Mavi b {{BOWLER}} 38(17) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Finch!! They all want to go home. {{BATSMAN}} is a bit early into tucking this seam-up delivery on a back of a length, and pops a leading edge to mid-off. Sticky Kotla? Certainly for Delhi, now. {{BATSMAN}} c Finch b {{BOWLER}} 4(13)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Priyam Garg!! Quality catch by Priyam Garg at cover-point. This was struck so hard, but Garg has managed to take a sharp low catch towards his left. A short of length outside off and the cut flies straight to the fielder. {{BOWLER}} absolutely loves it as he celebrates his run with his arms wide open.. {{BATSMAN}} c Priyam Garg b {{BOWLER}} 11(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nair!! When things go wrong, they go hopelessly wrong. Even his favourite helicopter shot has gone wrong tonight, that should snuff out whatever little hopes Pune might have had. This was tossed up invitingly by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} cleared his left leg and whipped it off his toes - flat and hard, but straight to Karun Nair at deep mid-wicket. He didn't have to move an inch, accepts the catch gleefully. MS walks off, so do half the Pune crowd. {{BATSMAN}} c Nair b {{BOWLER}} 11(14) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Top edge, oh Bhuvi juggles but manages to take it on the second attempt. Lovely short delivery, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the hook shot, gets a thick edge, Bhuvi takes a few steps forward and manages to hold on. Great start from {{BOWLER}}, got both the openers. {{BATSMAN}} c Bhuvneshwar b {{BOWLER}} 7(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! {{BOWLER}} finds the breakthrough. A length ball at 146.3kph, {{BATSMAN}} tries to smash across the line by fetching it from outside off. Loses his timing - courtesy the extra pace - and spoons a straightforward catch to Buttler at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} isn't happy with himself. He knows that he has gifted his wicket away here on a belter. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 47(32) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! Gets {{BATSMAN}} with the back-of-the-hand delivery. But to be honest, that wasn't what defeated the batsman; it was more the drift that was taking the ball away. {{BATSMAN}} went for the cut, played out of sync with the lack of pace on the ball, and edged it behind. Sharp catch by KL Rahul, it must be said. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 10(13)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Christian Run Out!! 1 run completed. {{BOWLER}} was confident after whipping the bails off and he was spot on. Shortish from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it wide of long-on, Mayank rushed to the ball and fired in a perfect through on the bounce and adjacent to the sticks. {{BOWLER}} shatters the stumps. The second run was on and Christian should have been a touch more quicker. TV umpire has a look and catches Christian a few inches short. Christian run out (Mayank Agarwal/{{BOWLER}}) 6(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! Clips the drive hard and finds the man at long-on. That was a needless hit. It was in the over-pitched zone and the batsman wanted to tonk it over the long-on region but failed to get enough elevation on it. The boundary rider at long-on - BMac cups it easily. {{BATSMAN}} c Brendon McCullum b {{BOWLER}} 15(11) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Karthik Run Out!! Huge moment. The ball kissed the stumps but the LEDs didn't light up then, but it did when {{BOWLER}} got his fingers to it with the ball still in contact with his forefinger. So the third umpire had a few replays and gave it in favour of {{BOWLER}}. Very poor running this from {{TEAM}}. Second run-out of the innings. {{BATSMAN}} tapped the slower delivery towards backward point and took a few steps out, the ever eager Karthik was more than halfway down before being sent back, Duminy was the one who threw the ball and the rest as mentioned above. Karthik put in the dive but still was well short of the crease. Karthik run out (Duminy/{{BOWLER}}) 5(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! RCB have two now. They had a solitary wicket in the powerplay before today and that too a lucky dismissal of Warner and now they have two in the space of four balls. Short of length delivery angled across the right hander, the ball bounces more than {{BATSMAN}} anticipated, he goes for the steer and edges it behind to the keeper. AB has a juggle before completing the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by S Kaul!! {{BOWLER}} ends his spell with a wicket. Cramps up the batsman with a short ball and {{BATSMAN}} takes one hand off his bat as he looks to pull it away. The timing wasn't great as he miscued it to fine leg. Kaul was the man in the deep who almost made a mess of it. {{BATSMAN}} has done his job though as his team is within touching distance of an emphatic win. {{BATSMAN}} c S Kaul b {{BOWLER}} 22(16) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} is running through Gujarat Lions. This was the leg-break and {{BATSMAN}} had no idea about it. This was tossed up on the off-stump line and spun back in slightly, {{BATSMAN}} didn't read it, was playing for the straighter one, gets beaten on the inside edge and is rapped on the pads. The impact was in front of middle, would have been going on and hitting the top of middle. {{BOWLER}} is on a roll and so are his team. The umpire has called for a strategic break. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 5(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Much needed wicket for RCB. Nicely bowled by {{BOWLER}}, he was troubling {{BATSMAN}} with his extra pace and bounce. This one angled across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to defend with an open face, the extra bounce surprised him, flicked his thumb and carried nicely into Kedar's gloves. The strong stand has been broken. {{BATSMAN}} c Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 14(11) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! That looked plumb and {{BATSMAN}} has been given OUT LBW. He has a chat with his captain and decides to review. It's a fair delivery, looks like no bat and UltraEdge confirms it, directly onto his toes, bang in front of middle and it's crashing low into the middle. Three REDS and {{BATSMAN}} is OUT. A poor review from {{BATSMAN}}, think he thought he got an inside edge. Almost the perfect yorker from {{BOWLER}}, turned out to be a low full-toss, {{BATSMAN}} swung all around it and missed. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 10(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! {{BOWLER}}ji will be a popular man at the Kotla now. It was a terrific delivery from him, he brings his experience to the fore and drags his length back. {{BATSMAN}}, on the charge, was nowhere close to the pitch of this widish leg break and he misses it totally, running past it in his shimmy. Pant behind the stumps takes off the bails, delaying it stylishly because {{BATSMAN}} was so far down the track, and thus a blistering innings from {{BATSMAN}} comes to an end. He came in like thunder and went back like lighting. {{BATSMAN}} st Pant b {{BOWLER}} 67(26) [4s-4 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! The familiar ploy. The ploy of taking the time-out to get yourself a wicket. Plays itself out yet again tonight. Patel floats it up generously and {{BATSMAN}} looks to unsettle the new man with a charge down and an aimless slog. Misses the line completely and is undone by the sharp turn on offer as well.

            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! 50th scalp for {{BOWLER}} at the Chinnaswamy. Told ya! He's RCB's trumpcard and straightaway gets his team the breakthrough. CDG will be a relieved man for sure. Poor shot from {{BATSMAN}}, especially having tried this off the first ball of the over. Spinning into him and the Southpaw went for the fancy reverse after taking his front foot forward. Was in no position to play that shot and gets an un{{BATSMAN}}r-edge which {{BATSMAN}}flects back onto the stumps. The home crowd goes bonkers as RCB pick up their first wicket. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 23(20) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mayank Agarwal!! Lofted up, not much timing, and a good catch running in from Agarwal. He covered decent ground at long-off before diving forward with both hands. Five-fer for Ankit {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Mayank Agarwal b {{BOWLER}} 4(2) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Henriques!! And they lose a wicket first ball, good running catch from Henriques at extra cover. Robs the pace does Mohammed {{BOWLER}} and dishes it wide of off, asking {{BATSMAN}} to fetch. He fell for the trap looking to clear the ring, slices the stroke off the bottom half, the bat face turns on impact too. Henriques doesn't drop many, does he? {{BATSMAN}} c Henriques b {{BOWLER}} 42(33) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! Breathtaking catch from Kohli. Phew. It's a mistimed loft from {{BATSMAN}} down the ground and it would have landed short for most fielders at long-on. But Kohli races in and then comes up with some stunning acrobatics. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 23(10) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleans him up! Body blow to Delhi's chances of posting a fighting total. It's the skipper who's fallen. {{BATSMAN}} looked alright in his stay tonight but won't be there for the final flourish. Not the wisest of shots either, goes for a wild slog sweep against {{BOWLER}}, was the googly and hence, the shot was on. But it needed better execution as well which didn't happen. Sneaks through to ruffle the sticks. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 43(41) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! This is poor cricket from {{TEAM}}, they are losing wickets in clusters. Another unnecessary shot from {{BATSMAN}} and he's stranded way outside the crease, gave away his intentions way too early, stepped down the track, allows {{BOWLER}} to shorten his length. He still didn't accept defeat, swung recklessly across the line and missed, an easy stumping for de Kock. {{BATSMAN}} st de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 11(9) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Gone first ball. The length ball, batsman looks to go for the big monty and ends up dragging the ball onto his sticks. He had to throw caution to the winds but manages only a thick inside edge. {{BOWLER}} is finally getting amongst the wickets in this season after a disastrous start to his campaign. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Smith!! He's done it. Hat-trick for {{BOWLER}}, take a bow. Look at him celebrate, totally deserves it. RR dugout is over the moon. {{TEAM}} fans are stunned as they are quaking now. Loopy delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and bashes it airly. Finds Smith at mid-off. {{BOWLER}} is off on a celebratary run. {{BATSMAN}} c Smith b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Billings!! Zak attack strikes. Trap set and trap sprung. So, {{BATSMAN}}'s promotion fails. Lasted for just two balls. It was a fuller length {{BATSMAN}}livery on off-stump line, {{BATSMAN}} went for a half-hearted flick. It appeared that the ball might have stopped on the wicket. Nonetheless, he was early into the shot and it was the slower ball from {{BOWLER}} that fooled the batsman there. Skies it towards {{BATSMAN}}ep square leg. Billings sprawls in forward and pouches it with ease. {{BOWLER}} roars in {{BATSMAN}}light. {{BATSMAN}} c Billings b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! What happened there? Against the run of play, {{TEAM}} have lost {{BATSMAN}}. Looks to play the scoop and misses it completely. The ball hits the front pad and it looked quite adjacent to the sticks. Good decision from umpire S Ravi to give it out. It looked like there might have been some bat but wasn't to be and {{BATSMAN}} was happy to walk off. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 22(21) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nitish Rana!! {{BOWLER}} comes back into the attack and breaks the partnership that was turning out to be a threatening one. A floated delivery delivery leg, {{BATSMAN}} flicks it towards deep mid-wicket in his quest to clear the fence but doesn't get the timing right. Rana who was stationed near the fence, charges forward and puts in a dive to complete the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Nitish Rana b {{BOWLER}} 20(21) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} is on fire!! He has managed to hold on to a one-handed specky. Bowled a loopy full ball on off-stump and {{BATSMAN}} clearly didn't pick the change of pace on that, just checked his push and chipped it straight in the air towards the bowler. {{BOWLER}} had to control his momentum, leap up to his full height and grab it one-handed mid air. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Klaasen!! {{BOWLER}} has his man! He's deserved a wicket and has got a timely big strike. The ploy of bowling googlies against {{BATSMAN}} pays dividends. The left hander charged down and wanted to go with the spin on the off-side but skewed it aerially towards sweeper cover. The sub, Klaasen, clings onto the chance, much to the relief of his mates and the energetic home crowd. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Klaasen b {{BOWLER}} 37(23) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! {{BATSMAN}} holes out! A mistimed loft and he finds one of the safest pairs in the world. The leg-break on the stumps and {{BATSMAN}} moved leg-side to go downtown. The bat face turned at the point of impact and hence lost his timing. Goes miles up in the air, but straight to RJ at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 30(19) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! How unlucky is this for {{BATSMAN}}. He's lapped this full toss right off the bat-face onto middle stump. Walked across, got down low, and set himself up perfectly. But just couldn't get under it unfortunately to gain the elevation needed. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 35(19) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Sees {{BATSMAN}} making room and pounds the short ball wide of off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} couldn't control his instincts having cleared his front leg way too early, finds a thick top-edge on the swat pull. All Parthiv Patel needed to do was amble back a few inches to pounch the catch, good pace from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 18(16) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! {{TEAM}} slump into further trouble, {{BOWLER}} strikes in his first over. This was full and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} was lunging forward - he was looking to dab it down towards third man - gets a thick edge, to the right of MS. Dhoni doesn't drop it this time around, dives to his right and clutches it safely. Six wickets down and {{TEAM}} are pretty much done and dusted at the moment. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 13(17) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bairstow!! Edged and gone. Slower balls in loop from Kumar, this was much fuller and {{BATSMAN}} swings blindly. Is too early into the shot and ends up nicking it to the keeper. {{BOWLER}} picks up his first wicket and {{TEAM}} lose another wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 10(7) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Guptill!! Punjab are fighting back into this contest. A big, big wicket in the context of the game. Hold on! They are checking for a possible no-ball but he's fine and {{BATSMAN}} has to continue the long walk back to the pavilion. The Mumbai skipper's destiny doesn't last long. Totally fails to connect this flatter delivery and ended up hitting it straight to Guptill at long-on. Too easy for him and he ain't dropping those. Stunned silence in the crowd. {{BATSMAN}} c Guptill b {{BOWLER}} 5(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! The promotion experiment to force things along doesn't pay off. {{BATSMAN}} has a role to slog, he clears his front leg and tries hoicking the fuller length into long-on. But the pace is just not there, sticks into the surface, spits up, miscues and finds long-on to perfection. {{BATSMAN}} c Manoj Tiwary b {{BOWLER}} 8(6) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! Taken! It was in the air for a long time but Dhawan kept his composure to snaffle it well inside the rope. A big cheer engulfs Chepauk as MS Dhoni makes his way out to the middle. {{BOWLER}} gives is not afraid to toss it up and {{BATSMAN}} is down the track to go big again, he gets it somewhere close to the bottom and Dhawan steadies under it at long-off. He had run in and needed to track back, took it with his hands over his head. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 39(41) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! {{BATSMAN}} holes out at deep midwicket. Maybe the perils of good form, which gave him enough confidence to go after the bowling straightaway. But this comes right off the toe-end as he heaves it from outside off. Easy catch for Stokes. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 4(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! First IPL game after three years and {{BOWLER}} has his first wicket. And it is a vital breakthrough. Another start and another stutter for {{BATSMAN}}. His rope is coming to an end, especially with Simmons waiting in the wings. Short of a length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} pulls and gets it high on the bat, straight down McCullum's throat at long-on. Replays show that it was a slower ball - the leg-cutter and {{BATSMAN}} had to manufacture all the pace, which he couldn't. {{BATSMAN}} c Brendon McCullum b {{BOWLER}} 26(24) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Another massive strike! This is another severe dent made by the Mumbai Indians. Rash from {{BATSMAN}} who goes for the wrong option on a spinning pitch - against the turn. Wanted to hoick across the line but could only sky it high in the air. {{BOWLER}} himself called for it, trekked back and got under the skier with ease. What a start this is for MI! {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 5(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Henriques!! Big, big wicket this. The knuckle ball. Front of the hand slower ball, {{BATSMAN}} was way too early into the shot, looks to flay it over the infield, but instead slices it off the bottom half. It keeps sailing and soaring high, Henriques at cover runs back and plucks it with minimum fuss. {{BATSMAN}} c Henriques b {{BOWLER}} 23(11) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ashwin!! 141kph. Short. Head-lined. {{BATSMAN}} looks to make room. Pulls. Zero timing. Negative control. Mid-wicket inside the circle. And just like these broken sentences, {{TEAM}} crumble further. {{BATSMAN}} c Ashwin b {{BOWLER}} 17(11) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Williamson!! Give Williamson 10 bowlers and he'll win matches. Gee, how good is this SRH bowling? {{TEAM}} 6 down. Sheer panic. {{BATSMAN}} got across to this off-cutter and couldn't control his flick shot on the move, foxed by the lack of pace I reckon. It smacks the toe-end and loops up to KW at mid-wicket who gobbles up with supreme ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Williamson b {{BOWLER}} 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by M Pandey!! An England 2014 dismissal. Plays around with his ego here does {{BOWLER}} darting it wide outside off. {{BATSMAN}} couldn't resist, throws his bat out stalking it with the drive, way away from his body. Just enough nip under the lights for the ball to grope the thick outside edge and fly away to second slip. Sharp astute captaincy. {{BATSMAN}} c M Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Finch!! {{BATSMAN}} has a smile, a frustrating one as he departs. That was short, at his body and {{BATSMAN}} closes the face of the bat on the pull but finds the man at short fine leg to perfection. He doesn't believe his luck. He timed it well but placement deserted him. The fielder - Finch gobbles it up somehow as the ball threatened to pop out. Massive strike from {{BOWLER}} who has both hands up in the air and soaks in the moment. He has scalped one of the best in the business. {{BATSMAN}} c Finch b {{BOWLER}} 10(13) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Andrew Tye!! They're checking {{BOWLER}}'s front foot but he's fine. A bit of a sudden rush of blood from {{BATSMAN}}, but he bats like that, doesn't he? Didn't read the cutter that was pitched on a back of a length, went for the mightly hack across the line and sliced it off the toe-end to deep mid-wicket. There were two other fielders running back from inside the ring but that was Tye's catch all the way. {{BATSMAN}} c Andrew Tye b {{BOWLER}} 12(10) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! That's what wickets and pressure do. There was never a single in it and {{BATSMAN}} wanted the run, Axar was tad late in sending him back and the skipper's dive was in vain. Nothing but a tossed up delivery which {{BATSMAN}} taps to the left of cover, Axar took a step out before aborting from the run. And with {{BATSMAN}} not being the swiftest he was always in trouble. Put in a desperate dive but was still short by some distance. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Negi/Parthiv Patel) 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! The early pressure has resulted in the fall of {{BATSMAN}}. This was a back of a length delivery on the stumps, it was the slower one as well. {{BATSMAN}} was in no position on the pull, went high off the bat and lobbed towards Shardul at mid-on. He runs forward and accepts the catch gleefully. Just the start RPS wanted - they have been on the dot and created the pressure on the batsmen. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Goswami!! That's the end of a fantastic 117-run stand. Sharp bouncer from {{BOWLER}}. We all know {{BATSMAN}} has a problem with the short ball, glad SRH thought about it too. This was a really good steepler cramping {{BATSMAN}} on the half-hook shot, was almost trying to evade, the ball catches the glove and Goswami jumps to catch the ball. The appeal was confident, umpire Marais Erasmus said no. SRH went for the review and {{BATSMAN}} walked off without waiting for the replays because he knew he hit that. {{BATSMAN}} c Goswami b {{BOWLER}} 32(24) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jofra Archer!! {{BOWLER}} hoodwinking the batsmen with his canny slower balls. This was on a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} swung it hard, lost his shape and skied it as far as long-off. Two fielders were converging and Archer completes the catch in the end running forward. A dot ball but Russell gets back on strike. Blessing in disguise? Eh? {{BATSMAN}} c Jofra Archer b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Goodness me! That is a spectacular catch from MSD. Sheer commitment and his athleticism was on full display while grabbing the catch. Dhoni seemed to have signalled something to {{BOWLER}} just before this delivery and I'm guessing it's something to do with lack of pace. Keeps it in the shortish length area does {{BOWLER}} and induces a thick outside edge on the slog. Dhoni dives full length to his right, juggles it on the first attempt and then takes the rebound with a sharp spring to his right. 150th IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}}! {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Harbhajan!! Not for once in this innings did he look at ease and eventually hands a dolly to Harbhajan at mid-wicket. Short ball, {{BATSMAN}} is clearly done in by the pace. Is late on the pull, the ball hits the splice and skies. Second one down for Delhi. They are not helping their cause. The move to send him up the order falls on its face. 150 wickets in the IPL for the great Sri Lankan. {{BATSMAN}} c Harbhajan b {{BOWLER}} 3(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by R Tripathi!! Oh dear! Oh dear! What is happening! {{TEAM}} have turned ON the HARAKIRI mode! This is rare, very rare. And look at {{BOWLER}}, he is pumped. It was a short of length delivery around hip-height, {{BATSMAN}} pulled and he gave the impression that he got decent amount of willow behind it. But square boundaries at SMS are massive and Faf picked up the man in the deep to perfection. Tripathi dives forward and takes a terrific catch. Fielding has been top-notch from the Royals! {{BATSMAN}} c R Tripathi b {{BOWLER}} 7(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Chopped on! Massive strike from {{BOWLER}}, just like he did in his previous over. The leg spinner to a left-hander is always a double-edged sword, this wicket proves it. Slows this down and drags it wider outside off, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to fetch it with a slog sweep but only managed a thick under edge that clattered onto the woodwork. Just when this partnership was gearing up to go up another level, it was been halted. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 27(21) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! {{BATSMAN}} has been dismissed off his first ball. Mix-up between both batsmen and {{BATSMAN}} was not even in the frame there. Gee! Another one bites the dust. Flighted outside off, {{BATSMAN}} pokes it to backward point and Russell wanted a single. {{BATSMAN}} was ball-watching and was late to kick-start. The fielder collects the ball and fires a throw to the bowler, who takes the bails off to catch the batsman short of his crease. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Rayudu/{{BOWLER}}) 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gowtham!! Sehwag's smiling in the dug out, perhaps because he's seen Gowtham take the catch and put the ball in his pocket. Very cool. A full toss outside off that {{BATSMAN}} timed well but this is a big ground, we must remember. So there's Gowtham waiting at a square deep cover, timing his leap just perfect to reverse-cup the ball above his head. {{BATSMAN}} c Gowtham b {{BOWLER}} 11(16)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The scoreline reads 7/4. This is surreal from RCB. What an over from {{BOWLER}}. {{BOWLER}} takes a hat-trick. {{BATSMAN}}'s woeful form continues. He fails to pick this googly from {{BOWLER}}. The crowd go bonkers. It came back in as {{BATSMAN}} prodded forward to defend, leaves a gap between his bat-pad. Enough for the ball to sneak through to rattle the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Stumps shattered, so is the {{TEAM}} dug-out. SRH win, by 13 runs. What an outstanding bowling effort this. This (the final wicket) was coming; {{BOWLER}} gets his line right and attacks the stumps with a full one, it was pacy and too hot to handle for Ankit {{BATSMAN}}, he went across his stumps to try the funky scoop over short fine and missed. Nailed, done and dusted. Timbahhhh...{{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 8(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! Mai{{BATSMAN}}n IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}} - beaten for sheer pace was {{BATSMAN}} - banged in short and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was rocking back on the pull, the ball kept getting big on him, he was in no control over the shot, gets a top-edge that spills straight up - Buttler called for the catch and holds on with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 23(15) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} can't be kept quiet for too long these days. He provides the first breakthrough for KKR and ends {{BATSMAN}}'s hit-and-miss innings. It was the wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} shuffled across to sweep, missed and is rapped on the pads. The question was whether the impact was in-line, umpire Nandan thought so and raised his finger. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 30(27) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed A wicket to cap the innings. Full toss that {{BATSMAN}} mistimed towards long-on and they were going for the second run. Had to with this being the last ball but Rayudu's throw at the keeper's end was on target. Dhoni whipped off the bails in a flash and even the dive couldn't save {{BATSMAN}}. {{TEAM}} end with an underwhelming total. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Rayudu/Dhoni) 3(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Full, all-pace, dead straight on middle. Well, certain things in life are just too good. This one was better than that good. Poor {{BATSMAN}}, he tried backing away to carve it through sweeper, but ended up missing it all ends up. It's middle's turn to get uprooted. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 26(23) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! People were talking about slower balls, spinners doing the damage, but this bloke has run in, bowled fast and found reverse swing to trap {{BATSMAN}} plumb in front. A great choice of delivery with {{BATSMAN}} walking across the stumps. Credit to the bowler if it was a deliberate ploy to opt for the full pace delivery. This was on a good length, tailed back in, batsman played across the line and the impact was right in front of middle stump. Would have at least clipped the top of middle and off. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 10(9) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Hit Wkt!! What happened there? {{BATSMAN}} starts walking. Karthik then sees the the stumps light up. {{BATSMAN}} has brought his bat down in such a way that it has clipped the off-bail. {{BOWLER}} went round the wicket and spears in the yorker outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in the crease to play that but as he is about to bring his bat down, he hits the stumps. Walks off with a smile on his face. {{BOWLER}} too had no idea as to what had happened. {{BATSMAN}} hit wkt b {{BOWLER}} 18(13) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Suryakumar Yadav Run Out!! Direct hit, and Punjab are already celebrating. Yadav clearly underestimates Shami - the short fine leg - as {{BATSMAN}}'s sweep goes to his right and decides to take his aim and his arm on with the quick single. Yea, nothing helps when it's a direct hit, not even a full stretch, and just like that, Surya finds himself run-out for the second time in these four games. Suryakumar Yadav run out (Shami) 10(7) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Gone! {{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} likes it. The quick delivery does the trick. Fired full and on the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} moves leg-side and swings his bat hard; misses completely. He attempted the big heave. Crashes into middle and leg. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 16(18) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Samuels Run Out!! Slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} taps it towards backward point again, a little bit in front of the fielder this time and they decide to go through for the single. Turns out, it's not a good decision after all. The man they are taking on is Ravindra Jadeja, one of the best fielders in this tournament, and if he hits, more often than not his arm will catch you short. Samuels is a yard out. Samuels run out (Jadeja) 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Slogs across the line and finds the man at deep square leg. Bangalore end their 2017 IPL campaign with a 10-run win. {{BATSMAN}} c Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 2(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Back to back wickets for {{BOWLER}}. What did {{BATSMAN}} do there? Perhaps was not expecting the slower ball first up. But gets one, is committed on the defence and by the time tries to adjust by slightly taking the bottom hand of the handle, it is late. Crashes the off-stump. If Bangalore were looking for a window to seal things, this is the one. AAAR CEE BEE is back here. Hat-trick ball coming up. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! The wrong 'un and the {{TEAM}} skipper seems to be at the wrong end of it again. First game: Tahir, Now: {{BOWLER}}. The ball decked in after landing and the meek prodded attempt from {{BATSMAN}} plots his own misery. The impact might have been around off even as {{BATSMAN}} lunged forward on the defensive push. The teen sensation continues to bamboozle the men. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 4(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! And another. Oh {{BATSMAN}} can't score against the Royals .. it's certified. A golden duck in Jaipur. A golden one now. {{BOWLER}}'s bouncer ploy consumes him, with {{BATSMAN}} being the compulsive puller going through with the swivelling flat-bat, timing it rather well in fact, but just not right when fine leg is that square. Another wobble, carrying on from the SMS? {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! A duck on his IPL debut for {{BATSMAN}}, but he wants a review. It's for a LBW call, umpire Gaffaney was quick to raise his finger, it's a fair delivery, the ball swung back in and thudded into {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he fell over on the flick and missed. Ultraedge confirms that there's no bat. Hawk-Eye in and it's umpire's call on hitting. Stays with the original decision and {{BATSMAN}} is OUT. A piece of history created in the IPL, {{BATSMAN}} becomes the first player to use DRS. This was full and swung back into the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} fell across on the flick and missed, {{BOWLER}} was on all fours as he turned back in appeal, the impact was in front of middle and leg, the ball was skimming the outer half of leg-stump. Good enough for the decision to stand. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Oh dear! This is disaster for the Royals - zero communication from both batsman - Lomror kept screaming at his partner who was oblivious to his call, kept running down the track aand then had nowhere to go. This was tossed up on off and {{BATSMAN}} pushed it towards cover-point, he took a step down the track and stopped, so did his partner and then suddenly {{BATSMAN}} had this urge to run - kept running even as his partner asked him to go back. All Shaw had to do was to pick the ball and throw to the kepeer - he does better and finds the stumps with a direct hit. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Prithvi Shaw) 5(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! A ripper from Faf du Plessis - but what was {{BATSMAN}} doing? First ball and he was looking to smash {{BOWLER}} out of the park, it was the leg-break and he didn't spot it, ended up slicing across the line, gets a thick edge that goes high and over the bowler's head. Faf charged in from the deep, kept his eyes on the ball and held on - despite sliding forward. {{TEAM}} are losing the plot in the middle overs. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! That's brilliant stuff from Mayank Agarwal. The excellence cuts short {{BATSMAN}}'s innings. To start with, {{BOWLER}} bowled a wide yorker. {{BATSMAN}} squeezes it out, finds Mayank at point and sets off. Mayank finds the target directly and {{BATSMAN}} is well short of his ground. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Mayank Agarwal) 31(22) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. {{BATSMAN}} had to go for it. He was the man who could cause more damage. Squeezes out the yorker to mid-wicket. Nair had a long way to run in and the batsmen thought the second was on. Nair gets there quickly and fires a flat throw to Pant, who does the rest. Even a full stretch from {{BATSMAN}} is not enough to save him. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Nair/Pant) 24(23) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Got him. {{BOWLER}} takes matter on his own hands and castles {{BATSMAN}}. Flatter ball, extracted just a bit of turn back in, {{BATSMAN}} sanked down for a blindfold slog, misses and sees his stumps rattled. Much needed breakthrough for SRH. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 39(25) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Another one bites the dust. A seam-up ball from a short of length, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall to heave across the line when he could have cut it through the off-side. All he manages is an inside edge that cannons onto the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! Edged and taken! Watson put one down in the previous contest but makes sure to take one today. It's a full length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} pokes at it and gets a thick outside edge to Watson at first slip. The youngster walks back to the hut without troubling the scorers. Excellent start for CSK and {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 0(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! 148.5kph of a brute. It's lethal. It's murderous. {{BOWLER}} keeps the seam up, bangs it some more on his neither-here-nor-there lengths and {{BATSMAN}} continues backing away to have punchy wafts over extra cover at them. But this one's too fiery to not be nicked, and a kiss on the outside splice will do just as fine. Just when you thought things were slipping out, eh!? {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 15(15) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Guess what, the young man from Kerala has beaten Chris {{BATSMAN}} for pace. The advantage of that busting action and jump. Gets the short ball to climb awkwardly onto {{BATSMAN}} who miscues the ambitious pull round the corner, just a few yards to the left of nonexistent square leg. {{BOWLER}} says mine, runs around and controls his momentum to take a clean catch. Boy, is he pumped or what... {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 23(22) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Washington Sundar!! {{BATSMAN}} perishes after reaching his fifty. Boy! RCB needed that badly. {{BOWLER}} as he ususally does for RCB, gets the wicket in the middle overs. {{BATSMAN}} premeditates the sweep shot, {{BOWLER}} saw that and he is astute enough to drag his length back and bowled well wide of off. It clipped his top-edge and Sundar takes a dolly at short fine leg. {{BATSMAN}} has done his job though, over to Pant and Iyer now. {{BATSMAN}} c Washington Sundar b {{BOWLER}} 50(37) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Too greedy. Dances down the track in looking to deposit another one of those crowd catchers. {{BOWLER}} smartly fires in the leg-break and darts it wide too. Wide enough for the ball to sneak under the bat on the move. Foxed by the wide angle starting from the corner of the crease. Saha doesn't mind some more work. {{BATSMAN}} st Saha b {{BOWLER}} 34(20) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The carrom ball bowled quicker and it hits the target as it explodes into the top of off. A wicket out of nowhere for KXIP and it is their skipper who has provided it. That might have skidded on after landing on the grassier part of the wicket. {{BATSMAN}} tried to dab it and missed. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 27(20) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Oh dear, total breakdown between the two batsmen, so much so that they were almost caught together at one end at one point. Back of length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} pats it towards backward point and takes a couple of steps down the pitch, which lured Buttler for the single. However, {{BATSMAN}} was guilty of ball-watching and quickly turned his back to him, while Buttler ran through to the striker's end. Eventually, {{BATSMAN}} may have sacrificed himself. Raina passes the ball onto {{BOWLER}} who under-arms it back onto the stumps to catch the struggling {{BATSMAN}} short. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Raina/{{BOWLER}}) 21(22) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bumrah!! No {{BATSMAN}} show today. Perks of having a leggie in your team. Leg-spinners might go for a few runs but on most occasions will fetch you a wicket. {{BOWLER}} has just done that and gives MI the first breakthrough. Serves the googly on a luring length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went for it, gets deceived by the flight and lost his shape completely. The outcome is a top-edge which spoons up to Bumrah at short third man, who takes the sitter. {{BATSMAN}} c Bumrah b {{BOWLER}} 16(10) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Siraj!! Slower ball on off, on the shorter side as well. {{BATSMAN}} has already given himself some room. That's like committing without knowing what is in store. Cannot retreat, it is late for him. Tries to ramp but there is no pace or the bounce to ease things for him. Ends up guiding it into the hands of Siraj at short third man. This is far from over. Delhi have not chased well and because they have not, they will need some extra effort to go past the line here. Time-out in the meantime. {{BATSMAN}} c Siraj b {{BOWLER}} 33(25) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} is on a hat-trick! The googly and it has gone right through the gate. A huge forward stride from Vijay {{BATSMAN}}, but he clearly misread the delivery there and played for the leg-break, not to be. It's RCB's game now and {{TEAM}} will need some magic if they are to pull it off from here. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The partnership has been broken. {{BOWLER}} yells out a loud roar. Change of pace does the trick. Fullish ball at 116.5kph, {{BATSMAN}} backed away a long way and exposed all his stumps. The southpaw didn't pick the slower one and wafted his bat at it, probably looking to go over the covers. Connected with thin air and the ball smashed into the sticks. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 36(32) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! A wicket off his first delivery against his former side for Ravi {{BOWLER}}. Loops it up teasingly and lures {{BATSMAN}} into a big hoick on the leg-side, poor connection and he top-edges it high into the night sky. Prithvi Shaw at short fine had ample time to settle under it. {{BATSMAN}} c Prithvi Shaw b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal {{BOWLER}}!! The {{BOWLER}} brothers have scalped {{BATSMAN}} here. Normal-paced hit-the-deck-hard back of a length delivery from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} backwed away and wanted to go over the in-field, with this being the last ball of the powerplay. Mistimes it off the top poetion of the bat and finds mid-on. Krunal takes a step back and grabs it over his head. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by U Yadav!! Clever bowling from {{BOWLER}}. Dug in the slower short ball, {{BATSMAN}} delayed his shot after reading it off the surface, the idea was to ramp it over short third man, since there was no pace the ball balloons to Umesh, who makes no mistake this time. {{BATSMAN}} c U Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 16(9) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rinku Singh!! Rohit Sharma is livid with this dismissal. The skipper thinks Surya should have carried on after getting off to such a good start. A short delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes back in his crease and pulls it away. Fails to middle it though, not much power on that shot too. Easy forward catch for Rinku Singh at deep mid-wicket as the umpire signals time-out! {{BATSMAN}} c Rinku Singh b {{BOWLER}} 36(32) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! A ripper of a leg-break and {{BOWLER}} has struck with his first ball of the comeback over - a top delivery and even better keeping - {{BATSMAN}} looked good during his stint, but he has to walk back to huge roars - that's because the next man in is MS. A quality delivery from {{BOWLER}}, drifted in, dragged {{BATSMAN}} forward with the length, made him think he could work it to the on-side, then the ball gripped and turned past the outside edge - quicksilver work from de Kock and {{BATSMAN}} was stranded way outside the crease. {{BATSMAN}} st de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 26(26) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Dropped, but {{BATSMAN}} is run-out. An absolute pandemonium out there. Who would have thought that a team that played so well and topped the league stage would find themselves at 79 for 7 in the 15th over of the final. And that too after opting to bat first. Rohit {{BATSMAN}} can't watch from the sidelines. Coming to the delivery, this one swung away from the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} got a thick outside edge which went low to Christian's left at first slip. He couldn't hold on, meanwhile {{BATSMAN}} thought of stealing a run, his partner wasn't sure and in the end he was stranded in the middle of the pitch. Great presence of mind from the bowler to run towards the striker's end and effect the run-out. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Christian/{{BOWLER}}) 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The zing bails light up the night sky again. {{BOWLER}} gets out the screwdriver in tightening the coffin. The coffin that had brought Delhi out of the dead. On the base of leg and nothing {{BATSMAN}} could do with it. Swings hard but the ball dips in sharply to scoot under the flashy blade. What a welcome {{BATSMAN}}'s had to the IPL nevertheless. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 44(39) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! Stunning work! This is the perfect definition of team work by Ingram and Axar. {{BOWLER}} has traveled a lot but will be relieved to see the back of {{BATSMAN}}. The wrong 'un which is fraction short, {{BATSMAN}} does not get enough power behind the pull shot, skies it to deep mid-wicket where Ingram is waiting, he takes it right on the edge of the boundary cushion and since the momentum was taking him over, he threw the ball all the way to Axar near long-on. The back hand flick was just perfect as Axar didn't have to move much. Huge moment in the game. {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 69(37) [4s-6 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Another one bites the dust. {{BOWLER}} is having a field day. What a spell! The slowness of the surface does {{BATSMAN}} in here. He was early into the flick stroke on seeing the flight and only managed a leading edge straight back to Jaddu who accepts it. Again no real celebrations from {{BOWLER}}. This has been a fantastic spell from the left-arm spinner. Fair to say that he has made a fine comeback after all the criticism. A nice innings from {{BATSMAN}} but he knew that he should have batted through. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 53(41) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! That was a length ball and has trapped {{BATSMAN}} plumb in front of the sticks. Nipped in from a length, {{BATSMAN}} was trapped on the back leg and missed the line to be adjudged LBW. His bad form with the bat continues. {{TEAM}} lose their first wicket. That was the pacy and skiddy delivery from {{BOWLER}} which angled in from round the wicket. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 6(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Appeal for a stumping and Pant looks confident. He's on the line and that means KL is OUT. That's some comeback from {{BOWLER}}, a beaut of a leg-break, drifted in from outside off, dragged {{BATSMAN}} forward and then spun past his outside edge. {{BATSMAN}} was lunging forward in defence, dragged his right-foot out and Pant is quick enough to whip the bails - even as {{BATSMAN}}'s feet stayed static on the line. Good bargain for {{BOWLER}}, 10 runs and a big wicket so far. {{BATSMAN}} st Pant b {{BOWLER}} 12(9) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Harbhajan!! Another one bites the dust. No heroics tonight from {{BATSMAN}} after his impressive debut the other night. Sharp bumper from {{BOWLER}} and the southpaw is rushed into the pull. Only manages a fat top edge that bobbles high towards mid-on. Bhajji settles under it merrily. DD have lost half their side now. {{BATSMAN}} c Harbhajan b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! {{BOWLER}} is on fire. This is a jaffa to remove the {{TEAM}} captain. A typical {{BOWLER}} wicket. Pounds it hard at 147.3kph on back of a length and gets it to straighten a tad, just a tad and {{BATSMAN}} ended up playing the wrong line, the outside edge settled nicely into Buttler's mitts. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! That's another soft dismissal and DD are seriously threatening RCB's score of 49. Catching practice for {{BOWLER}}, this was pushed through slower and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} rocked back on the punch, might have gone through with the shot a bit too early, lobs a simple return catch to the bowler - he accepts the gift with glee and {{BATSMAN}} walks away in disgust. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! No, sorry, forget the twist. It's that same boring script. {{BATSMAN}} looks to loft it through the line, but again, like the rest of his team, just doesn't get hold -- and with the bat-handle turning in his palms, long-off needn't do much. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! {{BOWLER}} had pared down Rajasthan with pace, or the lack of it. Three slower deliveries in a row and that was it for {{BATSMAN}}. Takes it on with a flat-batted swat and all he manages is a toe-end to mid-wicket. Krunal's tall and leaps a little to take this screamer. It's a pun alright, because you should have seen Krunal screaming. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 14(17) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Rashid Khan has gobbled this up like a candy in the deep. What ridiculous ease. Full ball on leg stump from round the wicket, {{BOWLER}}'s round the wicket angle cramped {{BATSMAN}} up meaning that there was no power behind the shot. He merely chipped it up. Rashid settles under it, around five yards in front of the boundary, and swallows it. {{BATSMAN}} c Rashid Khan b {{BOWLER}} 30(20) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Outrageous shot from {{BATSMAN}}! Was looking in good touch but just when he should have started to kick on, falls to a terrible stroke. Despite a deep mid-wicket in place, he goes for the aerial pull off the shortish length ball that had no pace at all. Gets it off the top half of the blade and it's a rather easy catch for Jadhav stationed there, precisely for this kind of a stroke. It's one-way traffic in Chepauk at the moment. {{TEAM}} don't seem to have turned up yet. {{BATSMAN}} c Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 11(9) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} is off and running here in Hyderabad - big wicket in the context of the innings, {{BATSMAN}} was one who could have anchored this innings for {{TEAM}} - the slider from {{BOWLER}}, pitched around off and kept going straight, {{BATSMAN}} was perhaps playing for the wrong 'un, made room and pushed limply - with a horizontal bat, the ball grazes the inside edge and bounces through to the middle-stump. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 15(17) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rayudu!! This was coming, {{BATSMAN}} never looked at home and he's sent packing, huge blow for the Mumbai Indians, they have been rocked early in their fortress. On a good length and a hint of shape away from the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to clout it over mid-wicket, doesn't cover for the movement, gets a thick top-edge, high and towards backward point. Rayudu - his partner until last season, calls for the high catch, keeps his cool and holds onto it. Dream start for the Super KIngs on their return from wilderness. {{BATSMAN}} c Rayudu b {{BOWLER}} 15(18) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Rinku Singh!! Has that been taken? Oh, it has. It has. The default Sub fielder for KKR - Rinku Singh takes a stunning catch. Another one falls and {{TEAM}} are losing the plot here. Second wicket for Krishna, who's been brilliant in his fresh spell. The slower ball, that dips and {{BATSMAN}} takes it on the full to mow it towards deep mid-wicket. Doesn't get it off the middle and the ball was dying in front of Rinku - who dives forward and gobbles it up. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Rinku Singh b {{BOWLER}} 25(22) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Huge appeal from {{BOWLER}}, and {{BATSMAN}} walks. Don't think the umpire was raising his finger initially. Anyway, this is unbelievable from the Royals. How they've found themselves in such a position after that Buttler innings is just... Back of a length, gains pace of the pitch and takes a faint outside edge through to Ishan Kishan. Massive blow to lose someone with {{BATSMAN}}'s experience. Now into the lower-order. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 12(15) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Two in two. Before this ball, {{BOWLER}} was talking to Bhuvi as he set the field. Whatever he spoke, he executed to perfection. Inswinger, lands on a length and goes through the bat and pad gap of {{BATSMAN}}. Too big a gap and the ball finds its way through to the stumps. {{BOWLER}} ends with a four-fer. What a story he has been this IPL. The whole of Old City in Hyderabad will be tucking into their biriyanis watching this. Certainly made his folks proud. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. No chance of two and {{BATSMAN}} is miles out. Spliced pull by {{BATSMAN}}, lands in the mid-wicket area, Kohli charges and fires in an accurate throw to Parthiv Patel who does the rest. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Kohli/Parthiv Patel) 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Morris!! \"Catch it buddy\" shouted someone and it has been caught at point. All too simple really. Short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} fails to keep the cut down and gives Morris an easy opportunity inside the ring. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Morris b {{BOWLER}} 6(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bumrah!! Another one bites the dust. The hard length has done the trick many a time on this pitch tonight and here is another example of it. Well-directed pacy bumper and {{BATSMAN}} gets into a tangle on the pull after having backed away early. Gets a top edge towards deep backward square leg where Bumrah takes a running catch, having covered decent ground from fine leg. {{BATSMAN}} c Bumrah b {{BOWLER}} 7(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Southee!! Another miscue, this time it goes straight to hand. Was it an off-cutter from {{BOWLER}}? Might have been. It was there on a length though but {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get hold of it and holes out at deep mid-wicket. The crowd erupts with \"Dhoni, Dhoni\" chants. {{BATSMAN}} c Southee b {{BOWLER}} 21(14) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! 'Phenomenal catch', says Matthew Hayden on air. That's a catch that might well tilt this final towards RPS. {{BOWLER}} is having a ball at the moment, this was another slower ball, he rolled his fingers across the seam. {{BATSMAN}} was looking to nudge it towards the on-side, was through with the shot even before it arrived, gets a thick leading edge that popped back towards the bowler. {{BOWLER}} was on his followthrough, pushes his left hand across - it was dropping down on him, he bends down really low and completes a fine one-handed catch. The momentum was always going across him, but he held on - even as his elbow hit the ground. Mobbed by his mates, rightly so. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 3(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has broken through. Look at him go. He's thrilled with the wicket of the Pune captain. It's that googly again. Snakes it back in from outside off and cramps {{BATSMAN}} up as he lines up a cut. Not sure if he picked it. The ball takes a thick under-edge, goes onto back pad and clips the outside of off stump. Big wicket at this stage. {{BATSMAN}} furious with himself. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 27(21) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Now this finds the fielder. More like a hoick-pull that {{BATSMAN}}'s fallen to. Takes the short ball on, swivels into an attempted glory hit and succumbs to the placement of the fielder at fine leg. {{BATSMAN}} c Bhuvneshwar b {{BOWLER}} 7(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The middle-stump has been uprooted! Goes for the yorker, bowls a low full toss at 141.4kph, {{BATSMAN}} moves across to scoop and doesn't connect. Hears the death rattle! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 10(13)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Both Karnataka men gone in consecutive balls. To {{BOWLER}}. He takes off his aeroplane and Mitch Johnson is seen clapping from the dugout. Pacy length delivery, on off, {{BATSMAN}} was late on the defence and it knocked the stump out of the ground. Played a bit inside the line and had no footwork to deal with that sharp delivery. {{BOWLER}} is now on a hat-trick. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} knocks over {{BATSMAN}}'s off-bail. It hit nothing else but the bail. Third wicket for {{BOWLER}}. He's been fantastic again today. A little bit of nip from a good length, {{BATSMAN}} was backing away looking to create a shot out of nothing and missed it by a long way in the end. He's played a fine knock though. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 45(36) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gurkeerat Singh!! Mann is the man for Punjab, finally. Takes one at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} went for the glory shot, the bat turned in his hand as he attemped the swing on this fuller ball. Skied it high and Mann, who was not having a great day before this catch of course, manages to reverse-cup it. Relieved, that was the look on his face. {{BATSMAN}} c Gurkeerat Singh b {{BOWLER}} 39(25) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! Guess who's pumped. Looked at who caught this. This was actually too short a ball to be lofted downtown. {{BATSMAN}} still goes for it, his bat ending up slicing the ball to long-on. Had to impart more power onto the shot if he was to put this away. Couldn't. Kohli's there, and as much as the shoulders might be on struts, he won't drop these. Not when RCB sense a win here. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Leg-stump out of the ground. They're checking the front foot, but {{BOWLER}}'s fine. That's insanely good execution of the yorker under pressure. {{BATSMAN}} gives the charge looking to smack it down the ground but he's really not playing the odds. The ball fizzes under him. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! First wicket for {{BOWLER}} in Mumbai colors. {{BATSMAN}} was undone by that top-spinner. He was looking to cut as he thought it was a leg-break. The extra bounce hits the top portion of the bat and lobs up in the air. The bowler calls for it and takes a straightforward catch. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 38(32) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Cutting!! He's holed out off a full toss. He swings hard but gets it right off the toe-end. It still goes pretty far and is caught just 5 yards inside the deep mid-wicket boundary. Cutting takes a smart catch running backwards and to his right. {{BATSMAN}} c Cutting b {{BOWLER}} 37(20) [4s-3 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! A troubled stay this. And {{BOWLER}} saves him further problems. The peppery bouncer comes out right, half way down the pitch and gaining in altitude even on this sluggish track. {{BATSMAN}} meanwhile looks to take it on with his swivelling turn in hooking it away. All he manages in the end it a kiss off the glove for a smart Saha to pouch it behind with his fingers venturing upwards. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 15(15) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Johnson!! The end of the rebuilding. Courtesy a stunner in the deep. And some greedy batting to go with it. {{BOWLER}} after a few carters doesn't really mind floating it up and he does it again. Entices {{BATSMAN}} into some feet dancing. Is obliged with the same. Just that in the process he gets too close to the pitch of the delivery and the tonk-slog attempted grabs only the toe-end of the blade to fly towards long-on. A jump, an arm raise and a reverse cup - as clean as a whistle executed by the man who claims to be 35. The best {{BOWLER}} figures in the IPL. A time-out with that. {{BATSMAN}} c Johnson b {{BOWLER}} 28(31) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bumrah!! No. No. That's what the {{TEAM}} fans and their faithful will be shouting and screaming now. There goes {{BOWLER}}, showing four fingers to the cameras and then signalling a boundary - which implies that he has got {{BATSMAN}} out four times in the IPL. After hitting the six, {{BATSMAN}} tried to repeat the shot, a little shimmy outsi{{BATSMAN}} leg to try and unsettle {{BOWLER}}, who kept his cool and fired it on leg, then {{BATSMAN}} came back into line, but since the ball came to him quickly, by the time he was down for the slog sweep, it was late, the top edge is found and Bumrah won't drop that at short fine leg. Too easy that one. And then {{BOWLER}}'s celebrations start. Yet another {{TEAM}} batsmen has flattered to {{BATSMAN}}ceive today. This time it is AB. And all this regular wickets won't do the si{{BATSMAN}} any good at all. {{BOWLER}} has a tale to tell his grandchildren one day. {{BATSMAN}} c Bumrah b {{BOWLER}} 43(27) [4s-3 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Length ball tossed up and he has chipped it straight to the man at long-on who dives forward and takes a good catch. He gave the impression to us that it might have stuck onto the wicket a bit. But it was a bizzare shot as he just lofted it without any particular intent on the shot. End of a good knock from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Bhuvneshwar b {{BOWLER}} 39(24) [4s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Two for {{BOWLER}}-gee! Googly again. {{BATSMAN}} hides his bat between his legs after running it off the face of the bat. But, the umpire isn't fooled by any of his tactics. Pings his index finger straight up acknowleding the appeal from the keeper. It twirls away from a good length and massages the edge en route to Rishabh Pant. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 17(16) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rabada!! {{BOWLER}} ends with a googly. {{BOWLER}} ends with a wicket. {{BATSMAN}} hasn't been reading it well all innings, so does what the manual teaches on such occasions - sweep - and so what if the line is well outside off? {{BATSMAN}} commits, gets a big top-edge and Rabada's waiting there at deep mid-wicket. Delhi making Hyderabad pull off a Delhi? {{BATSMAN}} c Rabada b {{BOWLER}} 10(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Devdutt Padikkal!! {{BOWLER}} brings an end to {{BATSMAN}}'s stay! Keeps this one slightly wide outside off and the batsman has to reach out for it. Throws his hands at it, as the ball is miscued towards long-off where Padikkal isn't going to miss out. He'll be disappointed that he couldn't get a fifty. Right then, it's Jofra time.. {{BATSMAN}} c Devdutt Padikkal b {{BOWLER}} 47(39) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Navdeep Saini!! This is a big wicket for RCB, the move to bowl {{BOWLER}} has worked. Just as SKY was looking very determined to take {{TEAM}} home, he gifts his wicket. Flighted delivery spinning away outside off stump, not easy to loft the away-spinning ball on this surface, goes for the extra-cover region but hits it too high and very straight. Long-off moves to his left and swallows the ball to delight the away camp. {{BATSMAN}} c Navdeep Saini b {{BOWLER}} 29(23) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! {{BOWLER}} ambles forward with a smile, doesn't even bother appealing for he knew {{BATSMAN}} nicked it. There was a sense of doubt as {{BATSMAN}} stood his ground momentarily but he started walking off soon as the umpire gave his verdict. Short, skiddy and angling away outside off, {{BATSMAN}} looks to steer it square on the off-side and sends a fine bottom edge through to the keeper. Excellent low take from QDK. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mishra!! Mishraji in action again! You cannot take him out of the game today! Brilliant with the ball and now brilliant in the field. It was a slower one around off, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to turn it to the on-side. He closes the face of the bat early, it clips the leading edge of the blade. And 36-year-old Mishra, dives forward and takes a mighty fine catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Mishra b {{BOWLER}} 6(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nitish Rana!! {{BATSMAN}} and a slog can't be kept away for long. He'd tried it against Prasidh's pace and taken blows on his tummy, he does against {{BOWLER}}, only for a top-edge. One-kneed, stepping away from his stumps and then swipes across the line. Gets only height on this miscue, for Rana - at deep mid-wicket - to run and juggle. {{BATSMAN}} c Nitish Rana b {{BOWLER}} 11(11) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Guptill!! That's the final nail in the coffin. This is the lowest ever total defended at this venue. KXIP needed to win this badly and they did so with great ease. Fast bowler to fast bolwer. Result? He slaps hard and picks out Guptill at mid-off. Had only so much power. Alas! {{BATSMAN}} c Guptill b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Uthappa!! Uthappa takes it without much fuss. And Kings lose another one at the wrong time. It was a slower one on a back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} moves back, makes room, he wanted to thump it over mid-off. It comes off the bottom half of the bat and pops up in the air. And Robbie makes no mistake at mid-ooff. {{BATSMAN}} c Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 25(17) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by S Kaul!! Top edge and gone. {{BATSMAN}} wasn't going to die wondering. He was going to play his shots, here he pays the price, short of length on the stumps with steepling bounce, {{BATSMAN}} gets a fat top edge and third man takes a good catch. That was a skier and not easy under the lights. But Kaul hangs on. {{BOWLER}} strikes in the first over. {{BATSMAN}} c S Kaul b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Uthappa!! Talk about lapse in concentration. It happened with KKR and now with {{BATSMAN}}. Just throws it away, probably has thrown his spot away as well in the Indian team for the World Cup. {{BOWLER}} with the golden arm; tosses it luringly outside off and {{BATSMAN}} chases with hard hands. Slaps it uppishly and finds Uthappa at cover, who takes a good catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 5(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! What an over this. Double-wicket maiden. {{TEAM}} have been jolted early and it's the in-form {{BATSMAN}} who departs. Another tempting tossie, {{BATSMAN}} stepped out and doesn't quite time his loft. Skies it up as far as long-on and there was a fielder waiting for this. Faf doesn't make any mistake and {{BATSMAN}} shakes his head in disappointment. {{BOWLER}} roars. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! End of a 139-run stand. They needed a run-out to break this lethal partnership because nothing was working for KKR. Credit to Kuldeep for having the presence of mind to target the sticks at the bowler's end. This was a short slower delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} mistimes the pull uppishly to short fine leg, Warner raced across to get back on strike, {{BATSMAN}} was late to take off. Kuldeep took his time, took aim and hit the bullseye. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Kuldeep Yadav) 29(30) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Done him with the googly. Actually, {{BATSMAN}} picks this one but he anticipates the ball to come back in a lot more than it does, so he ends up playing inside the line of it. It goes past his outside edge and knocks over off-stump. What a comeback from {{BOWLER}} after being hammered in his first over. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Excellent review and {{BATSMAN}} has to go! He was looking good once again tonight but falls prey to his addiction for the pull shot. The length wasn't really there on this occasion and he missed it altogether to be hit on the back knee as he crouched a bit. CSK were confident on the LBW appeal and sent it upstairs after the umpire's rejection. Nothing on UltraEdge and HawkEye shows Three Reds. Good review. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 5(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Agarwal!! Maiden IPL wicket for Varun {{BOWLER}}! A moment he'll remember for a long, long time. {{BATSMAN}} just had one aim: to slog and slog big. Goes for it but doesn't quite get it off the middle and his attempt to go over cover fails miserably. Skews it off the cue-end and Mayank Agarwal takes a brilliant catch running in from long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Agarwal b {{BOWLER}} 63(34) [4s-2 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chahar!! {{BOWLER}} has the last laugh! He is just too good on such surfaces and you can't just slog him away, which is what {{BATSMAN}} does to spinners anyway. Used his feet early and made room but {{BOWLER}} cleverly dragged the length back with no pace whatsoever. The result is a miscue that bobbles over the backward point region and Chahar trekked back to take a good tumbling catch. Both the openers sent back to the hut really early. {{BATSMAN}} c Chahar b {{BOWLER}} 6(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Slower short ball, {{BATSMAN}} swings into a pull but all he manages is a top-edge through to Dhoni. The Royals sinking rapidly now. Hardly any celebrations from CSK. Dhoni just throws the ball back and waves his players to their respective positions. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! {{BOWLER}} has been exceptional today. Deceives Patel with an off-cutter that gripped off the deck. Patel checked his loft, didn't go full throttle and ended up chipping it tamely to Hardik at long-on. Safe as houses! Another one bites the dust. This is superb comeback by MI. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 13(12) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! {{BATSMAN}} gets carried away and picks out Pollard at mid-wicket. He's aghast and well, Rohit, who's back on the field enjoyed that. Banged in short outside off, it was getting big and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to pull. Was in no control and the timing also went for a toss. {{BOWLER}} draws first blood for Mumbai. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 7(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! {{TEAM}} are falling apart. Another wicket off a short ball. {{BATSMAN}} was in no position to play the pull, still goes for it and pays the ultimate price. It came onto him quickly and was cramped for room to play the pull; loops up off the splice and the bowler takes the simplest of catches running forward. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 8(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! {{BOWLER}} crashes {{BATSMAN}}'s party. And he's off. Gets rid of the Indian captain, SRH have their tails up. It was short, it was wide and there was width. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to have a piece of it, throwing his bat at it. Only succeeds in feeding an outside edge. Saha grabs it in front of his face and {{BOWLER}} didn't wait for the catch to be taken. Roars and redeems himself after getting slammed for a four and a six earlier in the over. Pin-drop silence in the stands. {{BATSMAN}} walks off for one last time in this tournament, not a great IPL by his standards, definitely. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 16(7) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! {{BOWLER}} on debut has won the match for CSK with some excellent death bowling. He has bowled slower ones after slower ones and that has worked for him brilliantly on this deck. {{BOWLER}} = Replica of Bravo. It was on a good length and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to clobber it over long-on not enough willow behind it and Faf takes an easy one at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 67(59) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Atrocious batting from {{BATSMAN}}. Utterly and truly hopeless. His side have lost three wickets inside two overs and him being so experienced, is expected to bat till the 20th over. But what does he do? Swings across the line, without picking the googly. Past his shot and into the stumps. {{BOWLER}} goes off on his trademark celebration. Some collapse this is. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! Edged and taken! {{BOWLER}} likes that, claps hard after getting the {{TEAM}} skipper. A flighted delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} looks to go big, tries to loft it over the in-field but as the ball turns away, it catches his outside edge and flies straight to the lone fielder in the slip. Dhawan makes no mistake and takes it. Mumbai Indians need a Pollard special tonight, it seems. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 2(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! {{BOWLER}} strikes in his first over and sends {{BATSMAN}} back to the hut. It was a length delivery outside off, too close to the body and {{BATSMAN}} attempted a cut, he got an edge to it. Buttler behind the wickets makes sure to hold on to it. The batsman was in two minds there, whether to guide it to third man or play a cut shot. The dilemma resulted in his downfall. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 12(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Three slower death rattles - {{BATSMAN}} hoodwinks the first two. But the third one lights up Chinnaswamy. Whoa, talk of the ball dipping. Gets it straight on the stumps this time does {{BOWLER}}, gets it slow and right on the base. Nothing that can be done with it but play all around it and Kolkata come to a grinding halt. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! The momentum lets him down. In the quest of continuing with the scoring, he gallops down the track. {{BOWLER}} meanwhile bangs it in half way down the track and gets it to turn in sharply as well. A compulsive heave this off the body gets the inside half of the bat and finds short fine leg. A breeze of a knock clipped. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 23(8) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. This match is turning out to be a humdinger. Second wicket in as many balls. {{BATSMAN}} plays this one with soft hands towards deep square leg and called for two. While charging back for the second {{BOWLER}} somewhat got in his way and hence the batsman couldn't really take off. Mayank fires in a throw at the striker's end and Patel is nowhere in the frame. Drama! Delhi don't like easy wins, is it? {{BATSMAN}} run out (Agarwal/Rahul) 1(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! There goes {{TEAM}}'s last hope to post a decent total. {{BATSMAN}} 's horror IPL continues. For the third or fourth time this season he has got playing the cut shot. Short and wide, it was there to be smacked, {{BATSMAN}} cracks the cut straight to Jadeja at backward point. Third wicket for {{BOWLER}} and he takes his tally to 12. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 8(14)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sam Curran!! In the airrr, has he timed this? No pace on the ball, to be honest can't blame the pitch for this dismissal. Was right in the slot to tee off, but {{BATSMAN}} was hanging back for this one, didn't go through fully and sort of chipped it, long-on steadies and takes this around his left shoulder. {{BATSMAN}} c Sam Curran b {{BOWLER}} 17(16) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Harbhajan!! The breakthrough has been achieved. End of the 123-run stand between {{BATSMAN}} and Williamson. {{BOWLER}}, the man, with the much-needed wicket for CSK. Change of pace deceives {{BATSMAN}}, who was into his cheeky lap way too early. Had to generate some power to get it over short fine leg, couldn't and ended up hitting it straight to Harbhajan, who pouches it at the edge of the ring. {{BATSMAN}} c Harbhajan b {{BOWLER}} 79(49) [4s-10 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Manoj Tiwary Run Out!! Two dot balls to end the over. Still 15 off it. Another pinpoint yorker, {{BATSMAN}} squirts it out to the bowler. Manoj Tiwary is a long way down backing up. {{BOWLER}} easily removes the bails. Manoj Tiwary run out ({{BOWLER}}) 58(48) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Wow! First ball in IPL cricket and {{BOWLER}} gets one of the most successful batsmen in the history of IPL. Stuff of dreams! It was on a fuller length and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat at it in a clumsy fashion perhaps some overconfidence. It clips his inside edge and comes back to disturb his timber. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 15(13) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} is given OUT lbw, he's having a discussion with Pandey before eventually walking off. Krishna roars back strongly in his new spell after leaking 11 in his first over. Cuts back in from round the wicket, seemed like the slower ball. {{BATSMAN}} was lining up for a mow across the line, misses it totally and is hit on the back thigh. Looked pretty adjacent and umpire S Ravi took his time before raising the dreaded finger. so, {{BATSMAN}} falls right after his fifty. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 50(39) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mayank Agarwal!! {{BOWLER}} gets the better of the West Indian. But credit has to go to Mayank Agarwal, he's pulled off a stunner. Length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} miscued his loft, came more off the base of the bat. It was dropping in front of long-on before Mayank dived full length and grasped it inches from the ground. He didn't allow it to pop out even as he hit the ground. {{BATSMAN}} c Mayank Agarwal b {{BOWLER}} 27(17) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by R Tripathi!! This is not over yet, folks. Second short ball from {{BOWLER}} that gets the wicket. Got a little big on {{BATSMAN}}, who agreeably was pirouetting well on the back toe. Ended up top-edging it high to deep backward square, where Tripathy was waiting. {{BATSMAN}} c R Tripathi b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! {{BATSMAN}} finally runs out of luck and commits harakiri. Pushed the ball away with soft hands into the off-side and then yes-no, yes-no in the middle ensured both men were stranded mid-way. In the end, the ball was flicked up to the batter's end and the keeper did the rest to find {{BATSMAN}} well short. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Gambhir/Jackson) 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Roy!! Sliced up in the air, Roy lumbers across from long-off and takes it comfortably. Lovely bowling from {{BOWLER}}. He slanted this off-cutter away from {{BATSMAN}}'s swiping zone, and it gripped further away from him after pitching. Despite that, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't quite smarten up. He swings cross-batted and slices it off the outside half. {{BATSMAN}} c Roy b {{BOWLER}} 18(15) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! The sucker ball. On the umpteenth occasion a set batsman perishes after the team passes on a strategy in the break. Can't blame {{BATSMAN}} for anticipating the toe-crushing yorker. He gets one just that there is no pace at all on this one. Swings through his shot, gets one hand off the handle and eventually watches the ball pick out Pollard to perfection at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 17(15) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! {{BOWLER}} strikes! It's a huge wicket as well, that of the in-form {{BATSMAN}}. This skid off the track from a good length and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to smash this over mid-wicket. Got it off the toe end and it spooned high up towards extra cover where there were a few fielders vying for it. Dhawan called for it and took the skier with glee before letting out his trademark slap on the knee. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 9(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rayudu!! Sharp stuff from Rayudu! {{TEAM}} are falling apart quite early here. The shot selection is going awry at the moment. This was slightly short but not much bounce as {{BATSMAN}} looked to whip this away aerially on the leg-side. Didn't get the required timing as it dipped on short mid-wicket where Rayudu took a really sharp catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Rayudu b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja!! {{BOWLER}} has his man. This is similar to OVAL 2017. Kohli was given a life there but he gifted a catch on the very next ball. Same has happened with ABD today. {{BATSMAN}} attempts a slog sweep again, it stops in the wicket and {{BATSMAN}}'s timing was in a mess. This time the ball went squarer and Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja was the fiel{{BATSMAN}}r at {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket, he gets in a good position and takes a fine catch. RCB in serious trouble. {{BATSMAN}} c Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja b {{BOWLER}} 9(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hooda!! End of {{TEAM}}'s misery. {{BATSMAN}} surrenders. Short delivery, too pacy and {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull, launches it into the night sky as far as mid-wicket. Hooda cups it easily and that's the game in the bag for SRH. {{BATSMAN}} c Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! Third wicket for {{BOWLER}}. He's steaming in here. Bowls a full length delivery around off with not much pace in it, {{BATSMAN}} is a tad early in his flick as the ball hits the back of the willow before it spoons up towards wide mid-off. Jadeja won't miss those. {{TEAM}} in trouble. They're feeling the absence of Dhawan already. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 1(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! A brilliant innings from Surya comes to an end. His knock has ensured that Mumbai reach close to the par score on this wicket. He fails to get under the yorker, but still goes through with the hit. Ends up skying it in the air and Jadeja at long-on makes no mistake. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 59(43) [4s-8 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! Wicket of the second ball for {{BOWLER}}. Another short of length delivery that cramps {{BATSMAN}} for room. He tries to take him on with a pull. The ball gets big on him and he splices it straight to mid-on. Kohli takes a dolly. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! {{BOWLER}}'s doosra does the trick, and boy is he happy! Does a cradle like celebration for his daughter, who is in attendance today. That was fired around off and middle, {{BATSMAN}} knelt down on knee and miscued the slog, was trying to clear long-on, but didn't get the distance. Pollard sets himself at long-on and consumes with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 9(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That's an absolute peach. {{BATSMAN}} had no clue, still doesn't. Stands in his crease and stares at his stumps in total disbelief. That ball reminded me of the famous ball bowled by Warne to Gatting. {{BOWLER}} gives air on this occasion, gets it to drift in and beats him with the away-turn. Pitched around middle and leg, beat the outside edge and crashed into the off-stump. There's the breakthrough DD were looking for. {{BATSMAN}} not happy with Mishy's celebration in his face. Maybe something was said. Kept looking back while walking. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 45(31) [4s-3 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Excellent reflexes from Pant, KG has his man! Goes wide of the crease and digs the short ball into the surface, doesn't get as much bounce and the ball grips enough to mess SKY's plans to scoop it over the keeper. Takes the toe-end and flies to the right of Pant who adjusts nicely to pouch it safe on the dive. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 26(27) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Karthik Run Out!! This time MS doesn't miss and his opposite number is well short. {{BATSMAN}} looks to heave this length ball through mid-wicket and misses. MS, who had his right glove taken off, collects it and finds the target direct. OUT by a long way. Karthik run out (Dhoni) 29(26) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rayudu!! It's not happening on the night for the Royals. An ugly looking slog for {{BATSMAN}} and he becomes RJ's 100th IPL wicket. A nothing shot from one of the premier batsman across every format - this was tossed up around middle, {{BATSMAN}} bent down on the slog sweep, didn't get close to the ball and only managed to shovel it into the safe hands of Rayudu at deep mid-wicket. A disappointing shot and the Royals have lost half their side. {{BATSMAN}} c Rayudu b {{BOWLER}} 15(22) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Goswami!! 2 in 2 for {{BOWLER}}! This is an absolute jaffa that leaves {{BATSMAN}} clueless. Drifted into him from a good length and spun away sharply to square him up. He tried to reach out but could only get a feather on it and Goswami was sharp to pouch it behind the stumps. Even if there wasn't an edge, {{BATSMAN}} would have been stumped as he had got out of the crease in the bid to reach it. Excellent start for the Sunrisers. DD have been starting well of late but today, have been jolted early in the Powerplay. Alarm bells ringing for the hosts on this tricky surface. {{BATSMAN}} c Goswami b {{BOWLER}} 11(13) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! Where did this come from? Rohit {{BOWLER}} has taken a catch that for me qualifies as the grab of the tournament, at least so far. {{BATSMAN}} goes back to cut this leg-break, outside edges that flies to right of Rohit at slip. He spots it, not sure what was the reaction time, and plucks it one-handed when it has almost gone past him. Blinder from the Mumbai skipper. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! He dropped twice in the previous game, did Manoj Tiwary, but not today. {{BATSMAN}} couldn't have hit it straighter to the fielder. He went deep in his crease and backed away to manufacture room. Slaps (middles) this short of length delivery straight to Tiwary at short cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Manoj Tiwary b {{BOWLER}} 6(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned up! It has all gone downward in the last 20 minutes or so. {{BOWLER}} picks up his third. A juicy full toss and {{BATSMAN}} could have hit it anywhere, he backs away and is beaten for pace, the ball brushes the off-stump to light it up. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hetmyer!! The extra ball has benefited the home side. The previous ball was wrongly wided and {{BOWLER}} has dismissed the dangerous {{BATSMAN}} off his last ball of the spell. Another floated leggie outside off and {{BATSMAN}} decided to go for the inside-out loft. Off the outer half and also bottom part. Hetmyer gathers it with both hands at sweeper cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Hetmyer b {{BOWLER}} 5(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Lamichhane!! The extra ball has got {{BOWLER}} a wicket - this was full and this was wide of off - {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes lit up as he saw the width, went hard on the slash, gets a thick edge and the ball is swallowed by Lamichhane - running in from third man. {{BATSMAN}} walks off to loud cheers and that's because the new man is AB. {{BATSMAN}} c Lamichhane b {{BOWLER}} 9(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That's it. Bang into middle stump. {{BOWLER}} seals it and can afford a smile. Those two sixes cranked up the pressure but the young Aussie recovered well. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 60(45) [4s-5 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Negi!! The celebration from Virat Kohli and Co. just tells you this wicket meant a lot to them. {{BOWLER}} strikes gold for his team as {{BATSMAN}} departs. Got a lot of height on this mow, it's a big boundary at deep mid-wicket, it required more power to clear the fence, but sadly he couldn't generate it. Ubiquitous Negi circles around and pouches it safely. Massive blow to {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Negi b {{BOWLER}} 15(13) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! The ball nips away and takes the edge. First Kohli, now {{BATSMAN}}. {{TEAM}} are under heavy weather. {{BATSMAN}} has a lame poke at it without any feet and manages to edge it. Karthik behind the stumps has one of the easiest bargains. GL have started off on a roaring note. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 8(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Another reverse sweep dismissal! {{BATSMAN}} started his innings with a similar one but this time, like Munro earlier in the afternoon, misses it to be trapped LBW. {{BATSMAN}} tries to repeat the stroke but ends up losing his balance and is all over the place as he gets pinged before the stumps. Looked dead plumb. Probably didn't pick the leg break at all. KXIP chipping away at the wickets here at the back end. DD need a strong finish. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 9(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Through him. Flat through the air from {{BOWLER}}, zoots it through {{BATSMAN}} who's on the prowl down the pitch. Never allowed him to get anywhere close to the ball, cramped him up and it deflected off his pad onto middle stump. Do KKR still have hope here? {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 27(21) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Gambhir Run Out!! Brilliance from Mujeeb! Direct hits are always dangerous and it's proven this time. Slower ball on leg, {{BOWLER}} got away with this delivery as fine leg was up in the ring. Mujeeb was quick to attack the ball and threw down the stumps at the keeper's end in a flash. Initially seemed like Gambhir made it but he was just short. These direct hits I tell you. This Afghan lad is a champion, isn't he? What a debut! Gambhir run out (Mujeeb) 55(42) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Goswami!! Edged and caught! The perfect start from {{BOWLER}}, an absolute peach and he has gobbled {{BATSMAN}} up. Fraction short in length and a hint of shape away from outside off, made {{BATSMAN}} feel for the ball, found the tiniest of bat and Goswami does the rest. Defending 140, they needed early wickets and {{BOWLER}} has just got them one. {{BATSMAN}} c Goswami b {{BOWLER}} 0(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! Excellent take! Sharp short delivery on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} moved across, got inside the line and attempted the pull, the pace was just too quick for him, kissed the glove and flew to the left of DK, who flings full length to glove that. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 14(10) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! The Buttler serves this one up for his team by pouching the big man on the juggle. That was wide and on a length, the batsman threw his hands at that and managed to trample it straight down the throat of the man at deep cover. Buttler came in a few paces, juggled it once as the ball came at chest height to him and then on the juggle managed to grab hold of it. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 62(47) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Riyan Parag Run Out!! 1 run completed. Rocket armer Cutting. {{BATSMAN}} actually does decently to chip it softly through mid-wicket, and calls for the second immediately. But Cutting's quick to get to it and fire it back really flat and one-bounced to {{BOWLER}}, waiting right next to the stumps. Well, well, well, Parag ain't becoming the youngest ever IPL 50-ian. But leave that, have the favourites turned? Riyan Parag run out (Cutting/{{BOWLER}}) 43(29) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! It's a new entrant into the Dinesh Karthik school of catching - taking blunders after dropping lollies. And this is tough-er, with {{BATSMAN}} throwing his hands at a wide one and inside-outing the carve over extra cover. Pollard's at the boundary - running to his right, taking it palms pointing sideways. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 9(8) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! Spin, spin and spin. Ah, this is going to be some contest. Jaddu gets enough rip off the pitch, lands it around the ideal length and gets some purchase off the surface, hits the seam and turns just enough to kiss the outside edge. Raina at first slip has bucket hands, he doesn't miss many, does he? {{BATSMAN}} was caught in two minds there, wasn't fully forward neither back, just hung in there and poked at it. Late spot: The ball deflected off Dhoni's glove before it lobbed up to Raina. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 4(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Now, now. Two wickets in a span of three balls and this is a prized scalp for Rajasthan. {{BATSMAN}} is livid with himself, punches his bat in anger. It was his call and he has to pay the price. You just cannot underestimate Rahane in the field. A meeky tap to the right of Rahane. He moved across in a flash, picked it up with one-hand and released the throw in one-motion to break the stumps. Only one stump to aim at and bingo! {{BATSMAN}} wasn't even in the frame. Goner! {{BATSMAN}} run out (Rahane) 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stoinis!! The away swinger does it. Spills the ball outside off and {{BATSMAN}} looks to drive and edges it to the man at first slip. That flew off the blade and was taken by the slip fielder who sat under it and took it over his head. Nice carry off the wicket as the batter threw his hands at it. {{TEAM}} have lost Watto early, again. {{BATSMAN}} c Stoinis b {{BOWLER}} 5(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Now go and ice those fingers. {{BOWLER}} keeps up with the slower ones, this time changing the line to one angling outside off. {{BATSMAN}} swings his bat through the line, realizes he is way too early and has to settle for a chipped loft. Miscued. Pandya at sweeper cover meanwhile runs in and settles to cause some jitters. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 9(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! You got to be kidding me. Take a bow Shreyas Iyer. He's placed a man very straight behind the keeper and this ball goes to him. For a moment it looked a brilliant, cheeky scoop shot from {{BATSMAN}} to this low full around off stump, until the little fella - Prithvi Shaw - sneaked across to his right into the frame. He almost made a mess of it, juggled and took it on the second attempt. Don't be harsh on {{BATSMAN}} people, he actually played a good shot, but fell in the trap set by Iyer. {{BATSMAN}} c Prithvi Shaw b {{BOWLER}} 11(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! Pollard takes a really good catch. {{BOWLER}} dropping the slower ball short and wide of off, forcing {{BATSMAN}} to fetch, {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull, hit it decently, but big Pollard ran to his left, used all his height to great effect to take a gentle leaping catch. Well played young Dev! {{BOWLER}}'s actually on a hat-trick, got Finch off the last ball of his previous over. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 54(40) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock! Oh this is Vintage {{BOWLER}}. Maybe {{BOWLER}} isn't old enough for the word VIintage to be associated with him, so lets say \"typical\" {{BOWLER}}! Angling in sharply, brute-forcing even this unresponsive Kookaburra to straighten off the seam, and take the hopping batsman's outside edge to the 'keeper for a catch. QdK just about keeps that off his face. Might consider a helmet. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Talk about unfortunate dismissals and {{TEAM}} have two now! Must say it's a poor shot selection from {{BATSMAN}} for there is no pace on offer from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} shuffled across his off-stump and looked to scoop it past the keeper, lack of pace meant he failed to get any proper connection and ended up deflecting the ball onto stumps off his chest. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 12(13) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Down the pitch and gone! Wasn't anywhere near the pitch of the ball, but refuses to arrest his momentum; goes through with the shot and skies it off the cue end for long-on who takes the simplest of catches. Manish Pandey it is with bucket hands. {{BATSMAN}}'s intent was to clear long-on with the loft, but {{BOWLER}} did well to drag it back. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 12(15)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Hoho, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't have a clue of what's happened. He's too slow. This bumper from {{BOWLER}} hurries on from the middle of the pitch, and even as {{BATSMAN}} tries sitting down to it, he leaves his gloves up there. The ball kisses them enroute to Ishan Kishan. A gamechanger this {{BOWLER}} over. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has gone through the defence of {{BATSMAN}}. And this match has changed all of a sudden in the last couple of overs. Sensational spell from {{BOWLER}}. There was nothing special in the delivery, {{BATSMAN}} just misses it and it smashes his stumps. The decision of DK to give the extra over to {{BOWLER}} has worked brilliantly. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Atrocious batting from {{BATSMAN}}. Utterly and truly hopeless. His side have lost three wickets inside two overs and him being so experienced, is expected to bat till the 20th over. But what does he do? Swings across the line, without picking the googly. Past his shot and into the stumps. {{BOWLER}} goes off on his trademark celebration. Some collapse this is. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Back of length outside off, width on offer, {{BATSMAN}} slashes at it but only gets an edge through to Dhoni. Precious little cameo though. It's got the equation down to 12 off the final over. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 13(4) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Manoj Tiwary!! That's been hit high but {{TEAM}} here are unravelling, surrendering to Mohali's big dimensions. Knuckle ball, another one yeah, and {{BATSMAN}} finds long-on with this big loft. Manoj Tiwary there, who takes it and then kicks the ball away in celebration... {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Manoj Tiwary b {{BOWLER}} 5(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Moeen Ali!! {{BOWLER}} has the last laugh! Conceded a boundary and six earlier in the over but does well to get the better of the South African. Bowls a slower delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes ahead with his aggressive loft and holes out at long-off. Moeen Ali won't drop those and he doesn't. {{BATSMAN}} c Moeen Ali b {{BOWLER}} 32(21) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} is running through Gujarat Lions. This was the leg-break and {{BATSMAN}} had no idea about it. This was tossed up on the off-stump line and spun back in slightly, {{BATSMAN}} didn't read it, was playing for the straighter one, gets beaten on the inside edge and is rapped on the pads. The impact was in front of middle, would have been going on and hitting the top of middle. {{BOWLER}} is on a roll and so are his team. The umpire has called for a strategic break. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 5(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Bowled him. Just when Mumbai keep belting boundaries, Punjab manage to strike back with plucking wickets. Let's call it a nomenclature, {{BOWLER}}'s back-of-the-hand slower ball, aiming at the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} swung at it wildy, misses and is castled. {{BOWLER}} roars in joy. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} 19(6) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! W.W. And just like that, both set batsmen who'd laid this platform for the final assault, won't be the ones doing it, if it ever goes on to happen. A full wide delivery that {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat out to, but doesn't get close to the line, ending up outside-edging the squeeze to a diving MSD -- who has his 100th IPL catch. Wow, quite the equivalent of 400 Test wickets. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 63(52) [4s-7 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! The Fizz strikes, gets the DD skipper. {{BATSMAN}} was struggling and his struggle finally comes to an end. Short of a length around off and the opener goes ahead with the pull. As there's a bit extra bounce on the delivery, it catches the top edge and Rohit Sharma at short mid-wicket does the rest. Should have given the strike to Roy who's striking the ball so well. This wicket might affect Roy's mindset now! {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 15(16) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chakravarthy!! {{BATSMAN}} cannot believe it. He moved across his stumps and reaches out for a slow delivery way down leg, the cue-end balloons towards short fine and Chakravarthy takes a dolly. It would have been a wide had he let go but at this stage batsmen want to put bat on ball all the time. {{BATSMAN}} c Chakravarthy b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no run. An lbw appeal against {{BATSMAN}} and the umpire isn't interested. The fielding side decide to go up. Fair delivery. No bat. Pitched outside leg. No need to go further. Was a shortish ball that zipped through and {{BATSMAN}} missed the sweep after going down on a leg. Struck on the back thigh. Would have missed off too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! Ah, that desire to unleash your inner Dhoni, I0$ desire to smack big when singles could do just as well. Well {{BATSMAN}} falls for just I0$. So he rushes down, tries to hoick one downtown, but in the end ends up just too close to the pitch of it, miscuing it big time to a backtracking mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 13(16) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Basil Thampi!! This was coming. The approach to the pitch when he came out to bat wasn't that positive. He got a friendly ball on the pads first up, only managed to flick it behind square without power, then mistimed a hat-trick of balls before this one and {{BOWLER}} has got him with a bumper. {{BATSMAN}} wasn't expecting this from the pacer. Was looking to come forward, surprised by the bouncer, tries to pull off the back foot, {{BOWLER}} has a man at deep mid-wicket precisely for the top-edge and the man in the deep made no mistake as it came off the outside half of the bat. {{BATSMAN}} c Basil Thampi b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Murugan Ashwin!! That's a good wicket at this stage of the innings - {{BATSMAN}} was opening up, but {{BOWLER}} has his man. Short and angling down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to help it on its way with the shovel - didn't get hold of the shot and popped it in the air over square leg. Murugan Ashwin ran across to his left from the deep and completed the catch with soft hands. {{BATSMAN}} c Murugan Ashwin b {{BOWLER}} 10(5) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Jadeja Run Out!! Both batsmen are at the striker's end, and {{BOWLER}} calmly picks the ball up and runs at his end for the run out. He had rushed {{BATSMAN}} for pace with this short ball, inducing a mistimed pull shot beside the pitch. {{BATSMAN}} initially came down for a single, which set Jadeja on his way, but then turned his back on him. There was no turning back for Jadeja from there. Jadeja run out ({{BOWLER}}) 11(12)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! First wicket for DJ {{BOWLER}} in IPL 2020. Pushes this fuller and in the outside off zone, {{BATSMAN}} looks to play a cheeky dab with an open bat face but the ball takes the bottom half and lands in the bucket hands of Watto at short third man. {{BOWLER}} went up straightaway and so did Watson, the umpires just wanted to be sure as they deemed the soft signal in favor of the bowler. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 81(51) [4s-8 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! The hard length inevitably does {{BATSMAN}} in! He wasn't shying away from getting on the front foot, even to deliveries that didn't warrant it and that brings about his dismissal in the end. {{BOWLER}} kept it on the hard length and {{BATSMAN}} tried to go big down the ground. Never in control and the result is a miscue that Iyer takes at mid-off after trekking back a few yards. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 8(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gowtham!! Final nail in the coffin. Shortish, slower ball and the batsman heaved the pull away to be taken at cow corner. The batsman never connected properly and the mistimed hit was taken. RR only a wicket away from staying in contention for a place in the play-offs. {{TEAM}}'s dreams are over. Well almost. {{BATSMAN}} c Gowtham b {{BOWLER}} 14(17) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Timbah! What a response. He's pumped. Celebrates the wicket with a fist pump on his knee. {{BATSMAN}} is left clueless with this delivery. Drifts in the air and lands near leg and middle-stump, {{BATSMAN}} is caught in the crease because of the length, he then tries to maneuver with his hands, but the ball spins across to hit top of off-stump. Dream delivery for any leg-spinner. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 15(9) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! The bait does its bit. {{BATSMAN}} stays true to his gallops down the ground, goes mighty with another bat swing. Just that {{BOWLER}} this time has spotted this and has fired this wide. Very wide. In the form of the wrong 'un as well. {{BATSMAN}} cannot connect - despite his best attempts to stretch out - and Robbie does the rest. {{BATSMAN}} st Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 63(37) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Shorey!! Catch of the season? Faf has done something remarkable here. Heaved down the ground, Faf held his balance at the fence and scooped it up for the man at long-on - Shorey - who was closeby to take it. Credit to Shorey as well not to distract Faf and also linger closeby in case something like this happened. Superb presence of mind to throw the ball away in the nick of the time. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Shorey b {{BOWLER}} 14(13) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. It was a risky second and {{BATSMAN}} pays the price. It was his call and he was running to the danger end, took on de Grandhomme and came second. The knuckle ball on middle, nudged softly into the mid-wicket region. The Kiwi charged in from the rope and fired a flat throw right next to the stumps to Uthappa, who did the rest. Even a dive from {{BATSMAN}} was not enough to save him. Another start for {{BATSMAN}} that he doesn't convert. {{BATSMAN}} run out (de Grandhomme/Uthappa) 26(17) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Not anymore he's not. Dear me. He's chipped this knuckle ball straight back to {{BOWLER}}, completely bamboozled. Beautifully disguised on a good length around middle, {{BATSMAN}} tries working it through the on-side but he's way too early into the shot. SRH are turning a defence of 140 into a one-sided affair. Quite unbelievable turn of events here. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Head!! A really soft dismissal and you can tell that from {{BATSMAN}}'s reaction. Just wanted to throw that bat away. He was well set and looking good, the introduction of the left-arm spinner does the trick. Not a wicket taking delivery, but you do get wickets in this manner in T20 cricket. Flighted delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} steps out and drives inside-out, doesn't control the shot, hits it straight to cover. Can RCB work on this opening? {{BATSMAN}} c Head b {{BOWLER}} 33(21) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Vijay Shankar!! Kumar strikes! Half the {{TEAM}} side are back in the hut now. {{BATSMAN}} runs out of patience, decides to take on Bhuvi. It was a slower delivery and the West Indian didn't pick it. Was early into the shot and went through it, skews it off the toe-end and slices it towards deep mid-wicket. Vijay Shankar, the sub, runs to his left and pouched it safely. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Vijay Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 37(27) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! Game on! Both openers are back in the hut and it's that man, Samuel {{BOWLER}}, again. Shimmies out to loft the bowler over long-on, wasn't to the pitch, hits it right of the cue and holes out to the safest fielder on the planet. A-B-D. Clever from {{BOWLER}} as he followed B-Mac and fired it too close for his liking. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 3(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! This is a big wicket -- make no mistake about it. {{BOWLER}} was bowling from over the wicket, angles this in to cut the room on this preempted hoick over mid-wicket from {{BATSMAN}}. There's no arm-swinging space in front, the ball skids on to make it worse and {{BATSMAN}} holes out to the fielder at long-on, something Kevin Pietersen is ecstatic about on air. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 4(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Uthappa!! Maiden IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}} Krishna! Bowls the off-cutter at 113.4 and deceives the Mumbai captain. {{BATSMAN}} was early to swing his bat - an attempt to loft downtown. The bat turns and the ball lobbed to long-off off the cue end. Uthappa ran back from mid-off to gobble that. {{BATSMAN}} c Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 36(31) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Another return catch. There were a few at the Wankhede yesterday and the Eden surface is creating the same havoc. The googly from {{BOWLER}} which sticks onto the pitch a touch, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to work it away off the back foot but could only spoon it back to the leg spinner. A scratchy innings from the Australian. Never looked comfortable on this pitch. Right then, that means more responsibility for DK. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 18(22) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Chahar!! This has been a superb comeback from {{BOWLER}}, and from Mumbai Indians indeed. He was taken for 17 in his first over, but has come back strongly. Low full toss at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} attempts a cross-batted swing - more like a sweep, and skies it up off a thick top-edge. No problems for Chahar at long leg. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Chahar b {{BOWLER}} 5(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by U Yadav!! This was coming - {{BATSMAN}} was throwing his bat with gay abandon, change of pace does the trick for {{BOWLER}} - the slower ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} didn't spot it, went hard on the drive and dragged it to Umesh at mid-on. RCB needed this wicket - {{BATSMAN}} though has done his job. {{BATSMAN}} c U Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 20(11) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mandeep!! {{BATSMAN}} throws it away once again. Looks to thump the drive over the ring, but gets hit high on the bat and Mandeep takes a dolly of a catch (head-high) at extra cover. {{BOWLER}} always gets a bit of extra zip with his pace and the ball seem to have arrived much quicker than {{BATSMAN}} anticipated. {{BATSMAN}} c Mandeep b {{BOWLER}} 13(8) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Wow. Wow. 149.2 thunderbolt from {{BOWLER}}. Demolishes the stumps. What an over this is turning out to be. Two wickets in two balls and he's on a hat-trick now. Harpooned it full and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} had no clue and failed to negate it. Straight through him to shatter the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! Short of length on off, {{BATSMAN}} swings wildly but only manages a top-edge through to the keeper. There's a check on the no-ball but {{BOWLER}} is fine, just. {{BATSMAN}} c Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 5(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} misses a sweep and is trapped plumb in front. He doesn't even bother to review and walks off. So, the promotion not working for {{TEAM}}. Always dangerous to sweep someone like {{BOWLER}}, who is a skiddy customer and very accurate. {{BATSMAN}} premeditated it, sank low and it just zipped through quicker to rap him on the pad. Too quick for the Australian as he failed to get any bat on it. Umpire Nigel Llong raises his index finger and he's spot on. It was crashing the middle stump and Mumbai have lost two wickets in two overs. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The break does the trick. In the form of the strategy to introduce spin back. As has been a trend all through the tourney, the leg-spinners's wrong 'uns keep getting the rewards. Floats it up inviting {{BATSMAN}} to get forward on the drive. And then gets the ball to dip in sharply going through the tiny gap between the bat and pad to light up the timber. Much needed slow down this for Bangalore. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 30(25) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Woakes!! The greed. Oh it really is. Brings about his downfall. Tossed up wide, floating googly and inviting {{BATSMAN}} to take matters into the off-side. And he cannot resist it. Throws his hands out, with a lean and a reach out as he lofts it. Off the toe end and some clean diving at the fence seem to be enough to send him back. {{BATSMAN}} c Woakes b {{BOWLER}} 44(25) [4s-1 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Finch!! Break followed by a wicket. The bowling change has worked for GL. This is a huge wicket. {{BATSMAN}} was looking in ominous touch. Short of length delivery just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull and top edged it towards long-off. Finch had plenty of time to settle under that and he pouches it safely. Just what GL needed after the time-out and not what {{TEAM}} required. Steven {{BATSMAN}} was gutted with himself, smacks the bat onto his glove as he walks back. {{BATSMAN}} c Finch b {{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} 43(28) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! Spinners are doing the trick for RCB in the middle overs. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to smash it into the crowd again, {{BOWLER}} realized that and bowled it a little slower. It gripped in the surface. The spin on the delivery forced {{BATSMAN}} to mistime it and he ends up finding Kohli at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 52(37) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gambhir!! Mai{{BOWLER}}n IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}}'s painful innings is over. The frustration was creeping in, he walked across and tried to nudge it into the on-si{{BOWLER}}, it was an off-pace {{BOWLER}}livery and {{BATSMAN}} was fooled there. Gets a fat leading edge that goes up in the air. The skipper takes a simple catch at cover and the crowd roars in {{BOWLER}}light. {{BATSMAN}} c Gambhir b {{BOWLER}} 25(27) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! This is a dream dream over for {{TEAM}}. Now {{BATSMAN}} goes. No real emotions or celebrations from {{BOWLER}}. He is cool amidst all this. But familiar expressions on the RCB fans and players's faces. {{BATSMAN}} finds deep mid-wicket with a slog off a slower delivery. No power behind the blow. All three batsmen have expertly found the fielder in this over. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sam Curran!! {{BOWLER}} get {{BATSMAN}}! The leg spinner strikes on his first ball. Was a short ball by Piyush as {{BATSMAN}} pulled it straight to Sam Curran at deep mid-wicket. Looked a tired shot and the batsman will have to make his walk back to the pavilion. That's also a time-out.. {{BATSMAN}} c Sam Curran b {{BOWLER}} 26(19) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni! The slower one has done it! 119.8km/h, the knuckle ball, that wobbles unpredictably in the air, swerves away, courtesy a falling seam towards the on-side, and {{BATSMAN}} has been done in by the lack of pace - can't decide when to get his weight forward and has a waft at a transfer-of-weight drive into the off-side - his bottom-hand has come off the bat, no control, and he gets a healthy edge. Dhoni dives forward to pick up the catch that's dipping on him. Both the openers have departed, and CSK right back in it! {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 15(14) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Another one bites the dust and {{TEAM}}'s already declining hopes are further dented. Pacy and full from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} is quite late on the drive and there is a noise as this goes through to Pant. The appeal for caught behind is approved and {{BATSMAN}} goes for a review. Almost a forced one, considering the situation. It did seem like bat hitting ground and replays show that but, there's also a spike on UltraEdge as ball passes the bat. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 3(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Cutting!! A short one, outside off, {{BATSMAN}} tries to fetch it and attempts a pull, gets a top-edge. The ball crosses the stratosphere, makes a trip to heaven and lands up in the lap of Ben Cutting coming in from deep mid-wicket. Made it look rather easy. Universe Boss departs. {{BATSMAN}} c Cutting b {{BOWLER}} 18(11) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! From the lanes of Kerala to outwitting {{BATSMAN}} on the grandest of stages. A slower ball, and the funny bit is that {{BATSMAN}} did read it. Was wide outside off, so waited before letting out a forehanded slap. {{BATSMAN}} waits, and then some, and hits but couldn't impart the power that he should have. Straight to McCullum at long-off. Pune might be done here.. but hey, Stokes here. {{BATSMAN}} c Brendon McCullum b {{BOWLER}} 26(33) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, 144.7kph, very full ball on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} misses the flick and is struck on the front leg in front of leg. RCB went up for a review, but that was more out of desperation. The batters stole a run and Hardik will be on strike\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Round the wicket slower ball. {{BATSMAN}} knows what is coming, waits and decides to swing across the line. Is still early on the shot and misses it completely. The stumps get shattered off this off-cutter. Punjab get a window and the breather they needed desperately. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 18(10) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! Wow! Has Samson hurt his head? Landed badly on it. Slower short ball and {{BATSMAN}} takes it on, he miscues the pull to deep backward square, Samson misjudges it slightly as he overruns it but adjusts well to leap up and take it over his head, he tumbles backwards and that's when he hits his head onto the ground. Seems to be fine.. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 12(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Gone. {{BOWLER}} jumps up and down in delight. Angled in on a short of length on off, {{BATSMAN}} was trying to run it down between the keeper and the wide slip. But finds Ishan Kishan who hangs on. He is catching all the snicks tonight, apart from those, his keeping has been shoddy. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 6(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Soft dismissal. And against the run of play. That turned a bit, stopped as well on the batsman, who on his part had his feet glued to the crease and just tamely pushed it back to the bowler. A smirk on the face of {{BOWLER}} after he takes the catch. {{BATSMAN}} is gutted. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 47(25) [4s-4 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Mis-pumped. {{BOWLER}} goes back to keeping them short, which AB actually does well to pick up and try and launch over long-off. But no, there's only SO much even a superhero can do. Gets it off the un{{BATSMAN}}r half, without a lot of bottom-hand and Gill waits at the boundary, reverse-cupped. {{BATSMAN}} c Shubman Gill b {{BOWLER}} 63(32) [4s-5 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Rishi Dhawan!! And look what that extra delivery has done, it has fetched KKR the much-needed wicket. Yuvi walks back disappointed and has been asked to wait by the umpires. Oh hang on! What's the wait for? Just a little confusion out there and Yuvi continues his march. It was a slower short ball, Yuvi was through the shot way too early, didn't get hold of the pull and holes out to long-on. Good running catch from the sub fielder. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Rishi Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 26(16) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! No fifties for the openers. Warner misses it by a run and SD by two. It was a loopy full toss which dips under {{BATSMAN}}'s cross-bat hoick to crash into his stumps. Easily done. {{BOWLER}} has a wicket, been expensive thus far but this wicket should sooth his nerves. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 48(43) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Murugan Ashwin!! That's a stunning catch by Murugan Ashwin at cover as he times his jump to perfection and plucks it out of thin air. Was a back of a length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} had chipped it in order to clear the infield, however the fielder does well to pull off a blinder. With 10 balls remaining, {{BATSMAN}} had to go for it and perishes in his quest to get some quick runs. {{BATSMAN}} c Murugan Ashwin b {{BOWLER}} 14(7) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! Gone! He had to go after every delivery and this time he mistimes it. Third wicket for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}}'s cameo is cut short. Another slower delivery, {{BATSMAN}} went deep in the crease and got underneath it, but could not generate enough power to clear the incoming long-off fielder. {{TEAM}} needed {{BATSMAN}} to play through as he was looking more dangerous out of the two batsmen. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 26(13) [6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That looked a good shout for leg-before, and probably would've been given. But the umpire didn't need to bother eventually, as {{BATSMAN}} managed to drag it back into the stumps somehow. Leg-break that straightened on middle, {{BATSMAN}} missed his reverse-sweep and was struck low on the pad. It then ricocheted onto his gloves and was deflected back into the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 35(22) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Jadeja and Dhoni, goodluck taking risk against this duo. {{BATSMAN}} powers this low full toss to deep mid-wicket and there was never a two there, KKR still run in hope and hope is all that'll remain for them. Jaddu fires it quickly and MSD was in perfect position to deflect it onto the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Jadeja/Dhoni) 1(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! That was plumb! The ball landed on a length, angled in and hit the batter dead in front of the sticks. {{BATSMAN}} looked to play across the line and missed it to be in trouble. The umpire didn't take much time to make his decision. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Look at him go. Surely he's inspired by a certain South African in his team - Imran Tahir. As soon as he sees Dhoni complete the catch, {{BOWLER}} is off on a celebratory run. Runs past almost all his mates. Good length ball in the channel around off, {{BATSMAN}} has a needless poke at that, the hint of away movement takes the edge and Dhoni does the rest behind the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} does not trouble the scorers and RPS have an early wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 0(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The full swinging in delivery does the trick. That was pitched up and the batsman trying to play across the line of the ball, misses and is cleaned up. {{BATSMAN}} is gone for a blob and Mumbai have jolted {{TEAM}} early. {{BOWLER}} takes off as his joy knows no bounds. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Two big wickets within a span of three balls. This will hurt the defending champions. Piyush {{BOWLER}} gets the big fish. {{BATSMAN}} probably misjudged the length. Did that keep low? Not sure. It was a slider from a good length, {{BATSMAN}} went back to pull it away. Misses it by a long way and the ball crashes the middle stump. Gauti is animated in his celebration. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 37(35) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Rambunctious roars from {{BOWLER}} Singh in celebration as {{BATSMAN}} is cleaned up. He'd got down to sweep this off-break but missed it completely, beaten by {{BOWLER}}'s extra bounce. Much needed for the Super Kings as they seek to reign Delhi back. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 19(13) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Gone. The Nelson has struck. A fast skidding delivery that rushes past {{BATSMAN}}'s pull and strikes him bang in front of middle. Too quick for {{BATSMAN}}'s shot. Easy decision for the umpire. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 54(33) [4s-7 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! {{BOWLER}} seems to have come out with a clear plan against {{BATSMAN}} which is to bowl short and only short. One swing too many from {{BATSMAN}}, not in the best of positions (having cleared the front leg) to flay the ball over the off-side ring; goes for it and lobs it off the toe-end. Iyer calls in early from mid-off, runs forward and grabs it with a slide. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 26(9) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}}'s first game is cut short by a {{BOWLER}} nip-backer. {{TEAM}} are off to a flier but have now lost both their openers. This is a typical {{BOWLER}} wicket - fast, angled in from a length and just beats the batsman for pace, {{BATSMAN}} went nowhere with his footwork and remained rooted to the crease, pinged right in front of middle and ball-tracking showed it to be crashing into leg-stump. Second wicket for {{BOWLER}} and he's keeping the game in balance. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 15(11) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Vohra!! That's the end of the fun. Continues moving away, but for a change {{BOWLER}} learns his bit following him with a pacy length stuff. Gets too big on him as he tries powering it away once again with a loft. Miscues it all ends up and the balloon in the air is taken. Finally. At cover. Something's arrested. {{BATSMAN}} c Vohra b {{BOWLER}} 38(23) [4s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Third run out of the innings. Once again it's the rocket from Rajkot. Why do you take a chance against him? He is so good there. Coming to the ball, it was a short of length delivery just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} chops the cut to backward point and wanders out of his crease for a non-existent single. He is sent back by his partner. By the time he turns back and tries to return, Jaddu does the thing he often does. Finding the target direct at the striker's end. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Jadeja) 6(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hetmyer !! It's the longest part of the boundary at cow corner, but {{BATSMAN}} thinks his forward-charging-hoick would do it. Nope, much like his innings, and much like {{TEAM}}, this goes nowhere .. and that nowhere is straight down deep mid-wicket's throat. {{BATSMAN}} c Hetmyer b {{BOWLER}} 11(13) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! That's an excellent catch from Saha. Credit to Varun, kept persisting it with short pitch stuff and it pays off. After conceding 13 runs in his first over, he shows great courage and picks up a wicket. It was short and drifting down leg, {{BATSMAN}}, in a bid to tickle it fine, gloves it to the left of Saha. He flings and settles under it. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja! Can you believe it? He's dragged another rank half-tracker with a pull straight to Jadeja at deep backward square leg. What a meltdown. I'm out of words - which can be a pivotal drawback in my line of work. {{BATSMAN}} departs. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 7(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! Three fielders converge for the catch and Saha pouches it safely. Not before a bit of collision though. Natarajan aborted himself at the last second and evaded the dash, but Aaron and Saha didn't. In the end, Saha accepts while gliding into Varun Aaron who was running from backward point. It was a pull that never took off, off the splice of the bat. And then all the drama {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 21(23) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Chopped on! {{BATSMAN}} doesn't pick this one. He expects the ball to go away to aid his cut shot, but it turns in slightly to cramp him up. A thick under-edge into the pitch before bouncing up to knock over the top of leg stump. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 9(12) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Strangle down leg episode 2!! CSK are literally strangling {{TEAM}} here. Another {{TEAM}} batsman gets out to a poor delivery. It was slow, down leg and asking to be whacked, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and tries to oblige, ends up dragging it off his glove which makes a tiny tickle off his thigh pad before nestling into Dhoni's mitts. CSK are on fire.... {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 12(10) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Aravind Run Out!! No hat-trick for {{BOWLER}}. But a team hat-trick. Shortish outside off, {{BATSMAN}} cuts and misses. They run for the bye and Aravind isn't even in the frame as Parthiv Patel runs forward to effect the run-out. Aravind run out (Parthiv Patel) 0(0)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Maiden IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}}. He's slid that right through {{BATSMAN}}. Risky shot to play really. Darted in and skidding on from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} wants to cut it off the stumps but the ball hurries onto him. He doesn't have much room to work with either. Cleaned up. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 33(27) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That's a terrific comeback from the England star all-rounder, he slips in the leg-stump yorker - bowled at pace as well. {{BATSMAN}} was making room for the shot, has to jam his bat down - too late and the leg-pole goes for a walk, first wicket of the night for {{BOWLER}} and Pune continue to chip away. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 11(6) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! Eden Gardens is shellshocked. Reason - {{BATSMAN}} perishes. {{BOWLER}} strikes gold and is pumped. The top-of-the-hand slower ball, on a fuller length. {{BATSMAN}} was shaping up for a biff across the line, loses his shape and loses his timing as well. Slicing it up in the air towards extra cover. Rahane keeps his eyes on the ball, back-pedals and holds on. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 52(38) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Oh he's lost it. An argument with the umpire for the want of a wide has consumed his focus. Another walk across and he goes for an almighty slog swing. A top edge is all he manages with the ball flying high and mighty into the hands of the bowler itself. Did not even leave the pitch. And {{BOWLER}} bangs his head down in the process of almost messing up the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 58(39) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled! Knocked him over! The form-temporary-class-permanent thing is the cliche of all cliches, but he's nailed another yorker at 142.1km/h. {{BATSMAN}} has to move around and improvise to get under that and score some much-needed runs, but it's not going to happen. Not tonight. The bails light up and {{BATSMAN}} has to go. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Agarwal Run Out! Already a slower one @116.8km/h on a good length, {{BATSMAN}} delays a transfer-of-weight punch to Dhawan, and Agarwal tries to recover after backing up, but a direct-hit from Dhawan (and a thigh slap to follow it up) with one stump to aim at, has sent Agarwal packing! Fantastic throw by Dhawan, and certainly nothing iffy about that dismissal, with KXIP on the receiving end this time. Just a moment of brilliance. Agarwal run out (Dhawan) 6(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Gone. The Nelson has struck. A fast skidding delivery that rushes past {{BATSMAN}}'s pull and strikes him bang in front of middle. Too quick for {{BATSMAN}}'s shot. Easy decision for the umpire. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 54(33) [4s-7 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Umm, let me watch it again. {{BOWLER}} is so shellshocked that he takes all the time in the world to make sense of what has happened, and forgets to celebrate. That's what we'll assume. Note the pace: 100.7kmph. Hits a length and straightens it just enough to castle {{BATSMAN}}, who was looking to glide it down to third man. Beaten by the pace off the pitch. Just hurried at {{BATSMAN}} that. Happens. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 8(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Henriques!! Flicked off the pads and taken superbly by the man at deep backward square. That was on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} nonchalantly clipped it away without even thinking of keeping it down. The ball kept flying away before being plucked out by the substitute fielder. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Henriques b {{BOWLER}} 21(15) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! A soft soft dismissal for {{BATSMAN}} - he falls to leg-spin once again. The wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} read it well, came down the track, got close to the pitch and was then looking to launch it back over the bowler's end. Unfortunately for him, the bat turned slightly on impact and he ended up heaving it down the throat of Tewatia at long-on - didn't have to move an inch and the Royals have their man. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Tewatia b {{BOWLER}} 35(23) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by U {{BOWLER}}!! And this is what [Most] players do when they don't have a clue of which way the ball is turning. {{BATSMAN}} belongs to the same genre, or at least, looked like so. Crouches and looks to break the shackles with a slog-sweep, poor connection, Umesh {{BOWLER}} takes a well-judged catch at deep backward square. {{BATSMAN}} c U {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! This is a soft soft dismissal. I am afraid to say, it is not the ideal track for the opening match of the IPL. {{BOWLER}} gives this one lots of air, it sticks in the wicket, comes slowly and bounces extra off the deck. {{BATSMAN}} was on the back-foot, he wanted to work it to the on-side. He closes the face of the blade early, it hits his leading edge and pops up in the air. Bhajji takes a sitter of sitters. RCB in a spot of bother. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 9(8) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sam Curran!! {{BATSMAN}} throws his wicket as he tries a fancy shot. Goes down on his knee to pick the length delivery over deep square leg but ends up getting a top-edge. Curran settles himself under it and pouches it safely. Hopefully the batsmen to follow next bat sensibly. There was no need for {{BATSMAN}} to try out anything like this. {{BATSMAN}} c Sam Curran b {{BOWLER}} 6(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Dhoni Run Out!! 1 run completed. Phew! What drama! {{TEAM}} have lost their captain in a big pressure final! This was an overthrow which Dhoni was trying to steal and he will be unhappy with himself for doing something like this in a final. It was a short ball which {{BATSMAN}} got the glove on the pull shot, he hit it to Malinga's left and Slinga fired an overthrow at the bowler's end. The ball went only as far as mid-off, but Dhoni tried it take on the fielder but Kishan hit the bulls eye and ignited the stumps. This was a very tough decision to make. One angle showed Dhoni was on the line, but there was another angle which reckoned Dhoni may have just sneaked in. Thoughts of benefit of doubt going to the batsman circled, but Llong took a long time. Saw various different angles and pressed the red button. Dhoni run out (Ishan Kishan) 2(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja!! {{BOWLER}} has his man. This is similar to OVAL 2017. Kohli was given a life there but he gifted a catch on the very next ball. Same has happened with ABD today. {{BATSMAN}} attempts a slog sweep again, it stops in the wicket and {{BATSMAN}}'s timing was in a mess. This time the ball went squarer and Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja was the fiel{{BATSMAN}}r at {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket, he gets in a good position and takes a fine catch. {{TEAM}} in serious trouble. {{BATSMAN}} c Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja b {{BOWLER}} 9(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! Gone! One thing you can't do on a slow track is play the pull. Remember {{TEAM}}'s first game? Kohli and AB getting out playing the pull. This was short alright but the surface robs the pace off the ball, {{BATSMAN}} pulls it straighter than he would have liked and picks out long-on. Good catch from Tewatia - he ran forward and pouched the flat hit. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Tewatia b {{BOWLER}} 15(17) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Parthiv {{BATSMAN}}el!! Mumbai are running through Delhi. {{BATSMAN}} stays back to defend, plays for the extra turn. There is not much, takes the edge and settles into the gloves of the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Parthiv {{BATSMAN}}el b {{BOWLER}} 10(10) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! Yeah, {{BOWLER}} has the final laugh, as he so often does. Slower ball, probably a response to {{BATSMAN}} going for a scoop. And scoop he does, straight up and to the keeper with there being no pace to work with. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 8(3) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Mix-up and the captain fires a direct-hit from extra-cover. Look at him roar. {{TEAM}}'s best batsman on show thus far has been sent back. Massive setback. {{BATSMAN}} drove this full ball straight to Ashwin at extra-cover and set off, Dhoni said no straightaway - probably because of the niggle on the lower back. But {{BATSMAN}} had already covered a lot of distance and Ashwin's throw was spot on. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Ashwin) 49(35) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! And another.. Kings XI are back in this. No wicket for 36-odd overs and now they have three in seven balls. The slower delivery that sticks in the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} is on the backfoot because of the shortish length, he closes the bat face early and the leading edge lobs back to the bowler. {{BOWLER}} makes no mistake in his followthrough. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! You miss, I hit. {{BOWLER}} goes full and straight, very close to a yorker. {{BATSMAN}} makes room to smash that but the speed is enough to beat him. Goes through his flashy drive and knocks over the middle-stick. Picks up the ball and hands over to {{BOWLER}} too. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 19(13) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! {{BATSMAN}} has done his job here. End of a fine knock. The knuckle ball from {{BOWLER}} does the trick. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to cut hard and all he managed was a faint tickle. The man with the mitts gobbles it up and the umpire spotted the feather. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 53(36) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Markande!! {{BATSMAN}} goes for a golden duck. MI are fighting back here. We saw {{BATSMAN}} miscue a few in the last game against RCB as well, but those fell in no-man's land, this sliced cut lands in Markande's hands at backward point. Beaten for pace as {{BOWLER}} found some extra bounce off a short of length. {{BATSMAN}} c Markande b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Devdutt Padikkal!! More twist. More drama. {{BATSMAN}}'s fallen a solitary run short of his century. Uff! A slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, trimmed his length a bit and {{BATSMAN}} slogged it hard, doesn't have power to clear deep mid-wicket and Devdutt clasps onto it. Take a bow, {{BATSMAN}} though. He's played a gem and has taken {{TEAM}} closer.. {{BATSMAN}} c Devdutt Padikkal b {{BOWLER}} 99(58) [4s-2 6s-9]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! Almost a horrible bit of miscommunication between {{BOWLER}} and Rohit, but the Mumbai skipper just about takes it in the end. He can see the funny side now, won't have been so funny had it gone down. But what a horrible shot from {{BATSMAN}}. All {{TEAM}} need to do here is knock {{BOWLER}} around, the rate is under control. But {{BATSMAN}} charges out for a big hit. He's done in by the flight, and skies it up off a leading edge. It was {{BOWLER}}'s catch, but the youngster leaves it to the skipper without any indication. At the very last moment, Rohit sinks low and snaffles it off the turf. Phew. The 20-year old is inspiring the visitors and keeping them in it. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 11(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Binny Run Out!! 1 run completed. Another one falls. Royals in a bit of strife here. A fuller length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} blasted it to long-off. Karun Nair, the fielder was a little squarer and the second run was on. But after collecting it with a sliding stop, Nair released the throw in a flash accurately to the bowler. Binny was too casual and didn't bother to dive, which would've saved him. Not to be today. Binny run out (Nair/{{BOWLER}}) 11(7) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chahal!! The short ball gets big on him and the top-edge has been taken at cover. That was a close call for the bowler as he almost was on the line while delivering it but a dew millimetres saved him. A wicket too late in the evening for RCB. The formalities have been delayed. {{BATSMAN}} c Chahal b {{BOWLER}} 67(50) [4s-8 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nortje!! {{BOWLER}} has the last laugh! 144.6kph, dug in short, {{BATSMAN}} wants to hit another six. Despite not being in a great position, hurriedly plays a pull shot and gets a big top edge. Nortje runs in from third man and holds onto it safely. {{BOWLER}} is cock-a-hoop! Big wicket for Delhi Capitals... {{BATSMAN}} c Nortje b {{BOWLER}} 13(8) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Nair!! The field was set for the short stuff and it has worked. {{BATSMAN}} despite waiting on the back foot could not place the pull past the man at deep mid, who hardly moved to cup that. Short ball bereft of room and the pull despite being decently timed wasn't placed in the gap. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Nair b {{BOWLER}} 19(15) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} runs to appeal. He wants an LBW. But the umpire's given runs. When you are the skipper and the bowler, you don't consult anybody. We're upstairs. It started with {{BATSMAN}} shuffling, exposing his stumps and sweeping. {{BOWLER}} smartly slips in the quicker one, bang in line with the stumps. UltraEdge shows no edge. And HawkEye shows it to crash into off. Massive review. Massive moment. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 9(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Another review from MI. This time against KW for caught behind. Fair delivery. There's a sound. We'll have Ultraedge in a short while to confirm. There's a little spike. Is that enough for the on-field call to be reversed? I wouldn't want to be the third umpire. Well, the call has been made. Overturned! Two overs, two reviews and two wickets. Mumbai are coming back. It was the cutter from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} tried to run it down to third man. Gets a faint outside edge and Ishan Kishan pouched it with ease. The keeper and the bowler heard it. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 6(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shankar!! Mayank perishes trying to seal things early. Slower short ball outside off, was dug into the pitch with plenty of effort, and therefore Mayank's ill-timed pull shot couldn't clear the ropes. Straight down the throat of Vijay Shankar at deep mid-wicket ala Manish Pandey's dismissal. {{BATSMAN}} c Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 55(43) [4s-3 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! So {{BOWLER}}'s now got {{BATSMAN}} thrice in seven innings -- Bunny worthy? Anyway, {{BATSMAN}} didn't have much of a choice here. He'd realized he's got to everything left by himself, and so what if it's the Delhi's best bowler, He charges down, swipes across the line and ends up getting a thin inside-tickle through to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 43(39) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! It's over. Flighted delivery attacking the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} chips it straight back to the bowler. {{BOWLER}} gobbles it just above his head. Kolkata Knight Riders win by 71 runs. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! RCB have the breakthrough and Kohli is pumped up. {{BATSMAN}} has been bounced out. A head-high bumper on leg from {{BOWLER}}, gets a bit big on {{BATSMAN}} who got inside the line to hook it away. The ball trims the glove on its way to the keeper. AB moves to his left to pouch it. End of an entertaining knock from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 42(23) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rinku Singh!! {{BATSMAN}} looks to break free, but holes out at long-on. He was getting stuck out there, so wanted to release the pressure with a big shot. It was a full ball, probably a cutter, but {{BATSMAN}}'s bat twists in his hands as he swings down the ground. He miscues it off the inside half straight to long-on, who catches it at the edge of the ropes. {{BATSMAN}} c Rinku Singh b {{BOWLER}} 6(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Not this time. Not again. {{BATSMAN}} throws his head down in disappointment. Tried for a encore and failed to find the sweet-spot of the blade, enough air-time for Manish Pandey to run forward and claim a simple catch at long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 29(10) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Right off the toe of the bat and {{BOWLER}} catches it. Out comes the dance. A slower ball, {{BATSMAN}} had to wait an age for the ball to arrive, by the time he completed the shot, it chalked the cue end and found the bowler. A wicket CSK so {{BATSMAN}}sperately nee{{BATSMAN}}d. They break the stand that was threatening to consume them. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 53(37) [4s-1 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Kamikaze running and {{BATSMAN}} perishes. Tragedy for DD. {{BATSMAN}} was looking good but a miscommunication leads to his dismissal. Push-driven towards extra cover, there was never a single there. {{BATSMAN}} kept running, Pant took a couple of strides down the pitch before he stopped. The DD skipper was just a handshaking distance away from his partner and no way {{BATSMAN}} was returning. A clean pick and throw from Watto to MS, easy-peasy. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Watson/Dhoni) 13(14) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! Oh dear! This is a huge moment in the match. Virat-the-run-machine-{{BATSMAN}} has departed in single digits. It was a shorter delivery, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and takes out the pull shot. He hits it straight to the Jadeja at deep mid-wicket and Jaddu is safe as a house. He takes it with utmost ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 6(12)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hetmyer!! The perfect slap. But what can you do when the catch is the mother of perfects? Who else but Hetmyer. Where else but deep sweeper. And what else but a forward diving take to intercept {{BATSMAN}}'s flashy cut. It's clearly into his fingers, but when you've taken the decision to the third umpire, why not play around with a zillion replays, waste time, and then give it out. Yes. {{BATSMAN}} c Hetmyer b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! Catching practice for Pollard at long-off - the threatening partnership has been broken. Change of pace and {{BATSMAN}} was done in completely - the slower ball and {{BATSMAN}} had to manufacture all the pace on this attempted lofted drive - was looking to go over cover, but it skewed off the inner half and lobbed down towards Pollard at long-off. He didn't have to move, a fine knock from {{BATSMAN}} comes to an end. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 52(35) [4s-7 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Stephen Fleming shakes his head in the dug-out. And this is probably the first time he is showing discontentment in this IPL season. It was on a length and {{BATSMAN}} tucks it straight to Archer at short fine, Faf charges for a single and {{BATSMAN}} for some reason instead of running was ball-watching ( A criminal thing to do). Archer picks it up cleanly and smashes the stumps at the non striker's end where {{BATSMAN}} was short of the crease. RR are off to a perfect start. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Jofra Archer) 4(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mark Wood!! Aimless swing at the ball and the result? Caught at short third man. Walks across, gets down on one knee and swings hard at a googly, always a risk playing against the turn and thus, the top-edge lands as a dolly in the hands of the Durham lad. {{BATSMAN}} c Mark Wood b {{BOWLER}} 40(29) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! The ploy to bring the spinner has worked straightaway. So, {{BATSMAN}} is gone! A dot, six, six and OUT. Good ball that from {{BOWLER}}. A nicely tossed up delivery above the eyeline of the batsman wide of off. {{BATSMAN}} looks to slog it over mid-wicket from there and all he manages is a top-edge, that goes miles up in the air. Raina sprinted to his left from cover and took a sharp running catch. Tumbles on the ground, but ensured that the ball didn't pop out of his hand. {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 12(4) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! {{TEAM}} have lost both their openers now. A hit-the-deck-hard back of a length delivery that cramps the batsman for room. {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg for a pull shot, gets a top-edge that pops up a long way in the air. KL Rahul, the man with the gloves, moves backwards to snaffle it. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 24(9) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Christian!! Look at {{BOWLER}} chuckle. He thinks it's too easy. Goes wide of the crease and angles a ball in, enticing {{BATSMAN}} into a punch. And one he plays, just that he does it uppishly, and early, with this 139ks ball sticking in the pitch. Straight to long-on, who reverse-cups it. And now you know why {{BOWLER}} was smiling. {{BATSMAN}} c Christian b {{BOWLER}} 14(10) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! Back to back wickets and {{BOWLER}} is on fire. This was short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to help it on its way with a flap pull, gets a big inside edge that pops up off his knee-roll. KL runs forward and completes the catch, silence at the Wankhede as {{BOWLER}} scalps his 23rd victim of the season, he's on a hat-trick as well. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 27(15) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Harbhajan!! Redemption for {{BOWLER}}. Sombre faces among {{TEAM}} fans in the stands and {{BOWLER}} unleashes the Baby-in-the-arms celebration for a change. No celebratory run on this occasion. But poor shot this from {{BATSMAN}}. Just runs out of patience and goes hard on the whippy flick, hits it airly and finds Bhajji at short mid-wicket, who takes a sharp catch. {{BOWLER}} gave more flight and it kind of dipped which tempted the {{TEAM}} captain into playing that false shot. {{BATSMAN}} c Harbhajan b {{BOWLER}} 19(21) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Harbhajan Run Out!! 1 run completed. This is stunning bit of work in the outfield from Rashid Khan. Faf had absolutely drilled this drive to his right at deep extra cover. But not only does he race across and slide to stop it, he also fires in a rocket throw back to {{BOWLER}} to catch Harbhajan well short. Harbhajan run out (Rashid Khan/{{BOWLER}}) 2(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The stumps just keep flying. The heart of Pune being ripped apart here. And so is this innings. A length delivery assumed to be in the slot for the slog here from {{BATSMAN}}. He lines up neatly and does everything right in swinging his ba putting all forearms to good use. Just that there is hardly any bounce here to sit up for the timing to come out right. Scoots under the flat bat and sends the off-pole on a cartwheel. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! {{TEAM}} sink further as {{BATSMAN}} departs. Fails to read the googly and swings across. As a result of the wrong 'un a thick leading edge is induced and Dhawan at cover-point takes a well judged catch. Looked good for his knock of 24 but the onus will now be on Stoinis to brave the visitors out of trouble. Can he? {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 24(16) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! The fun is over. {{BOWLER}} cleverly took pace off after a barrage of pacy deliveries. {{BATSMAN}} had to slog at everything, given the match situation and he hasn't connected this well at all. Mistimed and finds deep mid-wicket to perfection. Tewatia has been a busy man tonight near the fence. Is that the game? {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Tewatia b {{BOWLER}} 32(15) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Gopal!! That's turned out to be a superb catch from Shreyas Gopal. He may have misjudged it initially, came running in, but then has to cut back to the right, almost going zig-zag. Eventually takes it behind his body. It's the slower ball from {{BOWLER}} that brings out the miscue from {{BATSMAN}}, and these long square boundaries ensure that it doesn't go over. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Gopal b {{BOWLER}} 57(47) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Knocked him over. So, he doesn't last long then. {{BOWLER}} cleans him up. He's been excellent today, rarely has bowled a bad ball. Just sticks to the traditional length and targets the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} follows a similar approach of making room and exposes all the three stumps. Misses it altogether on this occasion and the off-pole takes a beating. KKR have struck early here. {{BOWLER}} is delighted with the breakthrough.. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Knocked him over. {{BOWLER}} is off with his marathon sprint. The crowd go bonkers. It was a slider, just skids on and slaps {{BATSMAN}}'s leg peg as he fails to connect with the slog sweep. Got too greedy and paid the price. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 19(14) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The yorker from {{BOWLER}}. Played it too late and did not pick the length to york himself. The ball sneaking under the bat. How on earth?! That was the googly. {{TEAM}} in deep waters now. {{BATSMAN}} can't believe his luck. That was just a well flighted ball and he fails to pick it up. The LED bails sparkled red and RCB rejoiced more. Where is the fight {{TEAM}}? {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! Edged and taken. Some of the RR players run up to Watto and congratulate him. He was one of them for eight years and walks off to a standing ovation from the yellow army. Fine innings from the Australian. Fuller and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} with his typical bent knee looks to smoke it over long-off, only manages an outside edge to Buttler. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 106(57) [4s-9 6s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Poor shot!! Tries to be cheeky and loses his woodwork. That was flat and at the sticks, the batsman tried to open the face of the bat and run it down but misread the trajectory and the length to be clean bowled. GL break the momentum and get the huge scalp against the run of play. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 31(18) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Y Pathan!! Oh dear! {{BATSMAN}} follows Hetmyer in the dressing room. Don't write SRH off yet, they are still in the contest. And {{BOWLER}} just can't stop taking wickets. It was a slower delivery on a back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} picks it off the hands. He wanted to steer it over short third. It bounces more than {{BATSMAN}} anticipated and hits him high on the bat. Pathan at backward point makes no mistake. {{BATSMAN}} c Y Pathan b {{BOWLER}} 65(48) [4s-8 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! First IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}} and he's chuffed to bits. Short of a length and angling across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} was cramped for room as he went for the cut, gets an inside edge and the ball clatters into the stumps. {{BOWLER}} is pumped and so are KKR. DD in dire straits now. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 8(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rinku Singh!! Maiden wicket for {{BOWLER}} in IPL. A breather for KKR there. Short of a length delivery around off and {{BATSMAN}} pulls it hard again. But there's a fielder in the deep, it's Rinku Singh out there. He moves to his left and grabs it eventually to bring an end to {{BATSMAN}}'s blitzkrieg. {{TEAM}} couldn't have asked for a better start from the Aussie all-rounder. Wait on.. the crowd at Chepauk welcomes Raina with a loud cheer. The highest run scorer for {{TEAM}} in history of IPL is at the crease. {{BATSMAN}} c Rinku Singh b {{BOWLER}} 42(19) [4s-3 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Naman Ojha!! Two down. The slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} can only slog it high up in the air, a fat top edge, Naman Ojha calls for it and takes it with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Naman Ojha b {{BOWLER}} 61(40) [4s-5 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Munro!! This ball went into the stratosphere, thankfully it came down and Munro takes a really good catch at cow corner. Again a change in pace from {{BOWLER}}, it has become a stock ball for the pacers these days in this format. {{BATSMAN}}'s timing was dismal, he lofts it in the air and was cleanly caught by the Kiwi opener in the deep. Swirled under it and then positioned himself under the trajectory with a last-minute adjustment. Chest bump with Maxwell and all follow. {{BATSMAN}} c Munro b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! {{BOWLER}} has the last laugh in this mini battle. It was another short of length ball, {{BATSMAN}} stays put and smashes the cut shot straight to Samson at point. Ball came at a lighting speed and Samson does really well to hold on it. Universe boss will have to depart without contributing much. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 8(11) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! Oh, that's it for {{BATSMAN}}. Three consecutive boundaries from {{TEAM}} and here's the wicket. KP angles this across {{BATSMAN}}, who was always going for it. Gets a toe-end and Rohit nicely traces a few yards back at extra cover to take this. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 5(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Similar technique from {{BATSMAN}} - backing away to swish through off. But {{BOWLER}} does him with a yorker. It's too quick for {{BATSMAN}}. The ball bursts through to crash into the base of middle. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! AB clings on to the skier and a fine knock comes to an end. He has put his team in the ascendancy here. The cross seamer from {{BOWLER}}, seemed to have held up on the surface, {{BATSMAN}} went for the loft back over the bowler, skewed it off the base of the bat to long-on. AB ain't dropping those. Tewatia also pats his partner on the back as he walks off. {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 85(48) [4s-6 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nitish Rana!! Delhi lose by 146 runs and it's an IPL record. {{BATSMAN}} tries to clear the straight boundary but mistimes in the air for Nitish Rana to run across from long-on and catch it. Juggled a few times but managed to hold on. {{BATSMAN}} c Nitish Rana b {{BOWLER}} 2(11)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! People were talking about slower balls, spinners doing the damage, but this bloke has run in, bowled fast and found reverse swing to trap {{BATSMAN}} plumb in front. A great choice of delivery with {{BATSMAN}} walking across the stumps. Credit to the bowler if it was a deliberate ploy to opt for the full pace delivery. This was on a good length, tailed back in, batsman played across the line and the impact was right in front of middle stump. Would have at least clipped the top of middle and off. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 10(9) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! Another one bites the dust. Three wickets in four balls for {{BOWLER}}. The ball stuck a bit on the surface. It was a shortish delivery, {{BATSMAN}} is a bit early to close his bat face. The leading edge flies to the left of the bowler, who times his dive to his left to perfection. A terrific catch in his followthrough. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Boult!! Wowza! Maxi-Boult combo pulls off a replica of Mayank-Tiwary's catch. But hang on, they have referred it to the third umpire. No issues with the front foot and no issues with the catch too, looks pretty clean and {{BATSMAN}} can continue his long walk back to the pavilion. Two in two for Delhi and what a comeback. Jitters in the Mumbai camp as they lose their fourth. Tossed up on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} lifts it with a straight bat. Doesn't get enough power to clear long-on. Maxi stays at the edge of the ropes, grabs it and realises that he is going over the ropes. Throws the ball to Boult - who was waiting to gobble it up. Talk about tag-team effort. Outstanding. {{BATSMAN}} c Boult b {{BOWLER}} 7(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Williamson!! Length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} drags a lofted drive through the line towards long-on where Williamson, for a fleeting moment, nearly fluffs it and you can see the look of pure terror in his eyes. But his cat-like reflexes make sure he latches on during his second attempt. He - is - pumped! {{BATSMAN}} c Williamson b {{BOWLER}} 5(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Morris!! That's another huge wicket and {{TEAM}} are losing their way towards the end. Lovely piece of deception from {{BOWLER}}. He followed the slower short ball with another slower ball, rolled his fingers across the seam. {{BATSMAN}} was backing away on the lofted drive, gets it right off the bottom of the bat, plenty of height but not the distance. Morris settles under it and holds on at mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Morris b {{BOWLER}} 69(37) [4s-5 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!!Jinxed! Poor from the skipper. Length delivery and he just skied it up in the air for Faf, the ball magnet for the day, to take it at mid-off. That was a nothing shot. The bat face turned in the hands of the batsman for it to sky up. Fourth catch of the day for Faf. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 18(14) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! All it required was for {{BOWLER}} to come back. Bends his back, digs it into the surface, climbing into {{BATSMAN}}, who given the pace is predictably late into his pull. Off the splice and Unadkat at fine leg almost makes a mess -- loses it in the light, spots it very late and plucks it right off the grass. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 38(31) [4s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! The wheels are coming off for {{TEAM}}. Another one goes and {{BOWLER}} picks up his second wicket. Saw the batsman skip out, so Bhajji smartly slowed it up and pulled his length in addition to getting some spin off the deck. {{BATSMAN}} was nowhere near the pitch and flashed his bat in vain after getting beaten by the flight. MSD collects it and breaks the stumps. Easy stumping and CSK on top. {{BATSMAN}} st Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 8(13) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! This was coming. He wanted to target the offie right from the word go. But {{BOWLER}} a clever operator and out goes the middle pole. The key to this dismissal was once again {{BOWLER}} opting to bowl a flatter trajectory, knowing that the batsman was targetting the on-side boundary. {{BATSMAN}} was nowhere close to this ball, a wild swing it was, ended up playing outside the line and made a mess of the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! Deepak {{BOWLER}} ends his spell with a wicket. Just 7 runs in that over. {{BATSMAN}} was looking to clear the deep mid-wicket fence with this heave but he couldn't get the timing right. Holes out to the fielder in the deep and that brings an end to {{BATSMAN}}'s handy cameo. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 26(20) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Deepak Hooda!! Uppish flick again, and taken. It was almost the exact same ball like the previous one and was there for {{BATSMAN}} to dispatch to the boundary. But he finds the fielder at mid-wicket this time. He's gutted with himself. More importantly, a big confidence booster for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Deepak Hooda b {{BOWLER}} 13(9) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! This is very good limited overs bowling from {{BOWLER}}. We saw him adjust very well to Dhawan when he was given the charge, now {{BATSMAN}} runs down the pitch to smash the bowler, but {{BOWLER}} takes pace off, shortens the length and also follows the batsman, leaving {{BATSMAN}} nowhere to go. The batsman backs himself to play the pull shot, only mistimes it as far as mid-wicket. A dolly for Watto! {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 24(16) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Woakes!! Full delivery sliced away and Woakes in the deep came charging in and takes a great catch diving forward. That was full and again some tailing movement accompanied the ball. The batsman despite getting a meaty part of the bat on it failed to clear the man in the deep. In this sapping heat, Woakes putting in an effort like that speaks volumes of his fitness. {{BATSMAN}} c Woakes b {{BOWLER}} 11(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Two in two. {{BOWLER}} has four. Slower ball at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swings it in the air and is caught at the backward square leg boundary. Lovely deception from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Ishan Kishan b {{BOWLER}} 31(27) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! The apprentice is doing the job for MI. Second wicket for him and both have come in the death overs. The off-cutter and deceived {{BATSMAN}} completely, he didn't pick it and shuffled across to nudge it to the on-side, missed and is struck in front of middle stump. HawkEye shows it to be clipping leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 22(13) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} strikes! KKR badly needed this one because this partnership was getting ready to go bonkers. This was the quicker one from {{BOWLER}} and it skidded through low, {{BATSMAN}} didn't expect it to keep that low and his wild pull across the line didn't help his cause either. Misses it completely and the woodwork is disturbed. Nevertheless, a top quality innings from the young man. He's made a statement here in the IPL. This dismissal might actually worry KKR as they have to chase and it has started to keep low. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 62(44) [4s-7 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Gambhir!! GG exults. But the damage might have been done. Third wicket for NCN and he's been an inspired selection today. Low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} had to reach out for that, slices it low to backward point, where GG clings on. A fine knock from the youngster that. Gave DD the momentum going into the final overs. {{BATSMAN}} c Gambhir b {{BOWLER}} 38(16) [4s-2 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! {{BOWLER}} has bagged three wickets now! {{BATSMAN}} was looking to play a similar shot. Opens his bat face late and guides this one straight to Rishabh Pant. Got a boundary on the previous ball but the same shot has brought about in his downfall. Can {{BOWLER}} take a five-wicket haul? {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 19(12) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by R Tripathi!! It needed a blinder, it gets a blinder. Tripathi's ruined the fun with his brilliance. It was another flashy pull, just as crunchy-sounding and just as clean-looking. And make no mistake, there's plenty of legs on this. But, but, it's all too flat. And Tripathi, waiting at the deep mid-wicket boundary leaps up, judges it as perfectly as it could get. Nevertheless, {{BATSMAN}}'s put on a proper show, and he's helped himself to his highest ever score against the Royals. {{BATSMAN}} c R Tripathi b {{BOWLER}} 79(47) [4s-8 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson! Short at the body, {{BATSMAN}} loses his shape, instinctively worried about his fingers - he has history - and goes for a half-hearted hook. Gets a top-edge, as it lobs up towards the leg-gully area where Samson comes across to collect the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 72(37) [4s-1 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Horrible shot! Not the first time this season that {{BATSMAN}} has departed playing an atrocious stroke. Here is another example of it. The previous ball sowed the seeds of doubt in his mind and he went for a reverse sweep. Except that this was a dart from {{BOWLER}} aimed at middle and leg. 'You miss, I hit' type and it crashes into the stumps. Perhaps was too full for the stroke as well. Either ways, poor dismissal. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Now, now - this is simply sensational from Manish. He's had a shocker by his own high standards today, but he has pulled off an absolute ripper now. {{BATSMAN}} will consider himself desperately unlucky here, length ball and he flat-batted the lofted drive to the right of long-on. Had enough power, but not the elevation. Manish rushed across from long-on, threw himself at the ball - was parallel to the ground when he completed the two-handed catch and then had the sense to make sure that it didn't pop out when his elbow hit the ground. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 31(23) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Between his legs and uproots the leg peg. What.A.Sight. {{BOWLER}} finally gets his radar right as he springs this through {{BATSMAN}}'s legs. It dips and fizzes to defeat {{BATSMAN}}'s premeditated instincts, he was looking to flick it past 45, but makes no contact. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 21(27) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pat Cummins!! {{BATSMAN}} Sharma has been googlied again. Legspinners are having him for dinner this IPL. Big, big wicket this. Not sure if he read the wrong 'un, was on his knees looking to clear deep square with a slog sweep. Miscued, big time. Cummins gobbles it up at the edge of the boundary. {{BATSMAN}} c Pat Cummins b {{BOWLER}} 5(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Third wicket for Khan, he's having a ball tonight. Saw {{BATSMAN}} giving him the charge, banged it short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swung across in hope, gets a thick top-edge - simple catch to Pant. {{BOWLER}} has a few words to say as {{BATSMAN}} walks away. The end is nigh for Pune. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 14(6) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That last ball, which gripped, must've had a bearing in this dismissal. {{BATSMAN}}, expecting some turn this time, plays outside the line of the ball which sneaks through and crashes into middle and leg. 99.1kph from {{BOWLER}}, just zipped through with the arm from round the wicket. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! And {{BATSMAN}} doesn't make use of the reprieve. His watch is ended, however has done his job. The wily mystery spinner from Afghanistan picks up his second wicket. Saw the batsman advancing, pushed it through quicker and held it short too. {{BATSMAN}} didn't get to the pitch and misses his attempted slog. Easy stumping for Rahul. Two set batsmen back in the hut for the Royals. Rahman tops the wicket-takers chart with this scalp. {{BATSMAN}} st Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 82(58) [4s-9 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karn Sharma!! Two down! {{BATSMAN}} is distraught as he walks off. He has picked the man in the deep perfectly. Short of a length delivery on the body and {{BATSMAN}} went aerial on the heave. Got it off the top portion of the bat and found Karn Sharma at deep backward square leg. As he walks off, mocks the pull shot (to be played along the ground). Too late! {{BATSMAN}} c Karn Sharma b {{BOWLER}} 2(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! You are kidding me Faf! Surely you can't be taking these nimble footed catches twice in an over. {{BOWLER}} bowled full, so {{BATSMAN}} went for a loft over long-off, hit it really flat and hard, Faf had to move to his right a bit this time, yet he timed the jump brilliantly, released the ball as he was going over the rope and then swallowed it again. Big wicket this for CSK, will make a difference of 10 runs at least to the final total. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 14(10) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Massive strike from {{BOWLER}}! {{BATSMAN}} was looking ominous and if KXIP needed him gone, it was right here right now and that's exactly what the South African has done. Must say it wasn't a great shot from the {{TEAM}} skipper, stood rooted on the crease to an extremely full in-angler, attempted to just slog across the line, only to get struck on the back leg. Looked plumb in real time itself unless there was an inside edge but there wasn't. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 32(18) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Chopped on! Out first ball. Whoa! What.A.Start. Gabbar gone for nought. It was a classic away-swinger, {{BATSMAN}} went chasing after that and ended up dragging it back onto his stumps, off the inside edge of course. No room for error from {{BOWLER}}, bowled it on a good length and arrested {{BATSMAN}}'s feet movement to force an error. A mere push from {{BATSMAN}}, just feeling for the ball. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} has Chris Gayle, Virat Kohli and AB {{BATSMAN}} off consecutive overs. Now that's something to roast others about, in your white picket-fenced villa that you buy from your IPL contract. So, coming back to reality, AB was shimmying out of his crease, high on confi{{BATSMAN}}nce of bullying the last ball for a six. What San{{BATSMAN}}ep does is to keep it full but just about adjusts the line to something further outsi{{BATSMAN}} off. AB gets an edge on the charge and the keeper does so well to anticipate it all and move to his right to pouch that. Big wicket, {{TEAM}} stuttering. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} 10(6) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! Just Jadeja things! Takes an absolute specky, at deep mid-wicket, diving parallel to the ground to his right and just when he was about to skid onto the boundary triangles, tosses the ball to Faf (running from long-on) to complete the catch. Was loopier and the line teased {{BATSMAN}} to go for the big one, attempts a heave, only to be bettered by the fielding brilliance of CSK. The {{TEAM}} management won't be too disappointed and we could see {{BATSMAN}} play more of such roles for the rest of the IPL. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 17(9) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! There's a noise and {{BATSMAN}}'s gone. His poor form continues and it's a first-baller for the opener. But what a corker from {{BOWLER}} this was. Pounded it short, sprang up like a spitting Cobra after hitting the deck just outside off. {{BATSMAN}} was just pushing his bat forward aiming to defend. Scary extra bounce scraps the shoulder of the bat and carries to QDK. {{BOWLER}} is elated and Mumbai have struck early. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Searles!! Massive moment! Fullish one, too full to reverse, {{BATSMAN}} goes for it anyway, and gets it off the top half of the bat, and lobs it to Searles at short third man. A tame end to an otherwise excellent innings, and {{BATSMAN}}'s streak of 5 consecutive 50s comes to an end. 3 down, and {{BOWLER}} has made an important breakthrough. {{BATSMAN}} c Searles b {{BOWLER}} 39(22) [4s-5 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! One shot too many and {{BOWLER}} has two-in-two. He's on a hat-trick now. Gave his intentions away quite early, came charging down the pitch, allowed {{BOWLER}} to shorten his length - once past the swinging blade of {{BATSMAN}}, there was no coming back. Quick work from Bairstow and {{BATSMAN}} is well short of his ground. {{BATSMAN}} st Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 9(9) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Brilliant bit of work from Rana. {{BATSMAN}} is down on the floor and he takes ages to make his way back. Very full and almost close to the yorker length, {{BATSMAN}} slices it with an open bat face wide of short third man, Rana runs to his left from deep backward point, flings full length to stop the ball and then bullets a flat throw right next to the stumps to Karthik. There was never a second and even though {{BATSMAN}} put in the dive, he was well short. Huge wicket at this stage for KKR. They have removed one of the big hitters. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Nitish Rana/Karthik) 8(4) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Drags it on. Bends his back does {{BOWLER}} in bumping it in. And it skids on to stay a touch low for the anticipated lined up pull from {{BATSMAN}} to come out right. Too high in the end and takes the inside edge to light up the night sky with some red again. Punjab falling apart in search of their catapult at the end. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Top nut! {{BOWLER}} doing the damage for {{TEAM}} in the death overs. This is a big wicket, with couple of overs to go, {{BATSMAN}} would have unleashed himself. A yorker aimed for the base of leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} attempts to flick, gets his legs inside the line and allows the ball to slip past him, crashes into the leg-pole. He's on a hat-trick as well. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! {{BOWLER}} to the rescue for SRH again. He has easily been the bowler of the tournament so far and he has executed under pressure once more. A back of a length leg-cutter which is wide of off, makes {{BATSMAN}} reach out and he slices it up straight to sweeper cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 10(5) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Riyan Parag!! Much- needed wicket for Royals. It was a flighted delivery on a fuller length, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to dispatch it over long-on. It spins away and due to that {{BATSMAN}} failed to time it as well as he would have liked it. Parah at long-on came under it and takes it with utmost ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Riyan Parag b {{BOWLER}} 42(39) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Welcome to IPL, Kagiso {{BOWLER}}. Spears a 145ks tail-smashing yorker in the blockhole, opens PP up and thrashes his leg-stump. World class fast bowling. Nothing much PP could do about it. Too hot to handle. {{BOWLER}} is all pumped up, why not? {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 8(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Shorey!! There's the cutter, finally. {{BOWLER}} digs it into the pitch, taking pace off but {{BATSMAN}}'s loaded himself up early, is into his heave well before the ball can get there. Nah, can't pull out either. Goes through, miscuing and popping into deep square leg. Well you can't blame {{BATSMAN}}, he had to go for everything. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Shorey b {{BOWLER}} 3(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Shahbaz {{BOWLER}} strikes in his very first over. He's having a wonderful season. The umpire took his time before raising the dreaded finger. Did that pitch in line? Yes, it did and spun away. {{BATSMAN}} gets down on one knee and in his attempt to lap it fine, misses it completely. He is pinged on the thigh pad in front of middle and leg. HawkEye confirms that would have hit the leg-pole. Good decision from the umpire. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 3(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Gets greedy does {{BATSMAN}} and throws his wicket away. Didn't pick the top-spinner outside off and his wild bat swing only meets with thin air, PP completes the formalities behind the stumps sans any fuss. {{BATSMAN}} st Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 21(9) [6s-3]\n",
            "{{BATSMAN}} {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} steps across to paddle sweep and is bowled behind his legs. Oh what a massive wicket. Just went too far and then missed it, getting done by the pace at which this skidded through. Probably only clips the leg bail, but that's all it had to do. Mumbai in control now. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BATSMAN}} {{BOWLER}} 17(19) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! Holes out to deep mid-wicket. Slower ball, wide outside off and {{BATSMAN}} has to really fetch this one. Looks to wrist this away but these are big dimensions on that part of the ground. Doesn't get the distance on the stroke and picks out the fielder to perfection. A priceless cameo from the NZ skipper though. {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 41(26) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}}'s dragged on. Time was running away and he had to do something, so he gallops down the pitch with an almighty swing but the ball takes a long time to arrive. He's forced to reach out for it outside off, gets a thick inside edge and plays it onto leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 18(22)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Big loud nick. {{BOWLER}} has {{BATSMAN}} for the third time in as many IPL innings -- this time with {{BATSMAN}} throwing it away after losing patience, losing shape and losing his timing. He tries a cross-batted heave but the length's a little too full to be doing this, and ends up getting a tickle on the under-edge through to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 11(12) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! 144ks inducker nails him in front. Gets the ball to skid on after bowling the last ball a tad slower, and hurries him into a surprise. Nipped back in and rapped the pad above the knee-roll, but since {{BATSMAN}} was caught so deep in the crease - having read neither the line, length or the pace - he looks plumb. Umpire thinks for a few seconds and raises his finger. Ball tracking: shows it clipping the top of leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} strikes first ball! This was plumb. A carrom ball which pitches in line with middle and straightens. {{BATSMAN}} kneeled down to slog-sweep but in vain, to be hit on the back leg. Only one way that was headed. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 19(22) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Jadeja and Dhoni, goodluck taking risk against this duo. {{BATSMAN}} powers this low full toss to deep mid-wicket and there was never a two there, {{TEAM}} still run in hope and hope is all that'll remain for them. Jaddu fires it quickly and MSD was in perfect position to deflect it onto the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Jadeja/Dhoni) 1(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! Third for {{BOWLER}}. He's been exceptional today. Standout bowler by far for Royals. It was the sort of half-tracker that got Kohli and de Villiers couple of matches ago, {{BATSMAN}} went deep in the crease to play the pull and hit it straight to deep mid-wicket. The big England all-rounder ain't dropping that. RR fighting back with a couple of wickets. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 3(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. It's getting chaotic out in the middle and Rashid Khan was ball-watching as he tried to complete the second, didn't realize he was running in the same line as {{BATSMAN}} and both batsmen collided mid-pitch which led to an easy run-out. In fairness, there was never a second there and it's pressure that's consuming {{TEAM}} at the moment. {{BATSMAN}} worked it to deep square and by the looks of it, he wanted second right from the onset. {{BATSMAN}} run out (U Yadav/Philippe) 7(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shankar!! One brings two!! Is this the game changer? It's a slower short ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull but didn't really move his feet in terms of trying to reach the line of the delivery, it was well wide of him and that meant he got a thick top-edge which has been snaffled by Shankar at point. {{BATSMAN}} c Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 56(38) [4s-6 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! They sense it. Mumbai are gaining the upper hand. This is such brilliant captaincy from Ro. {{TEAM}} just lost a wicket and he brings his key bowler back for an over and prises out another. {{BATSMAN}} with a very lame attempt to pull/hook this short ball, wasn't going really hard at it, the ball takes the edge and QdK makes no mistake as it grabs the ball with a jump. Big roar for MSD as he walks out. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 1(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! The wrong 'un on off, a tad short, {{BATSMAN}} gets deep in the crease and has enough time to check out the leg-side field and then go for the shot. Pulls it straight down the throat of Krunal at deep mid-wicket who takes it comfortably. Is the foot on the rope? Nope, apparently not. Captain Capital's got to go. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 6(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Coulter-Nile!! Is that the game already? The big man has been given a proper working over, and now he succumbs. Short of length, skidding on off the deck, and hurries onto {{BATSMAN}} as he tries to heave it over wide mid-on. The ball slices up off the outside half and presents a simple opportunity to NCN moving to his right from mid-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Coulter-Nile b {{BOWLER}} 7(17) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Dragged on. {{BOWLER}} goes back to his trusted full-wide yorker. {{BATSMAN}} loads up for yet-another-hoick, giving it his all in his swing. Gets some bat for a change, it's the inside-edge and it's chopped onto off. A four-run-wicket final over, you really can't get greedier. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kul{{BOWLER}}ep Yadav!! That's miscued .. and a really good running catch from Kul{{BOWLER}}ep. {{BATSMAN}} tries to swing a ball into the on-si{{BOWLER}}, gets a thick top-edge which lobs in front of long-off. Kul{{BOWLER}}ep has to cover good ground and it's not easy to stabilize yourself against the momentum. But Kul{{BOWLER}}ep does really well. {{BATSMAN}} c Kul{{BOWLER}}ep Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! {{BATSMAN}} is disappointed with himself and rightly so. He's failed to take toll of a full toss. Doesn't really move around the crease, just looks to power it away over mid-wicket but doesn't get the required timing on that. Catching practice for Shreyas Iyer at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 8(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Would you believe it, {{BOWLER}} now has two in two. {{BATSMAN}} walks out to him first ball, tries to work this length ball round the corner but misses it. The ball gets stuck in his thigh pad and dips behind to knock over off-stump. These are crucial strikes as Delhi hope to reign things back. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Parthiv Patel!! In-slanter at 135kph just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} tries to run it down to third man and gets a faint inside edge. The RCB players went up straightaway and umpire S Ravi was late to raise his finger. The fielder from the off-side and threw the ball towards the bowler's end to effect a run-out. In the end, Ravi confirmed that it was caught-behind! {{BATSMAN}} c Parthiv Patel b {{BOWLER}} 6(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Delhi is going Mishy, Mishy, Mishy. A dot followed by a wicket. He completely foxes {{BATSMAN}} with this tossed up leg-break. {{BATSMAN}}'s weight takes him forward, who wanted to deposit it away with a slog sweep. The back leg is well in front of the crease. Pant whips off the bails in a flash. The only doubt in the third umpire's mind was if Pant gathered it behind the stumps. It's touch and go. The benefit of doubt goes to the keeper. OUT flashed on the giant screen. {{BATSMAN}} st Pant b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nitish Rana!! Way too early through his shot, played the shot on Monday, and the ball...Um! It arrives on Wednesday. Looking to flick, a healthy leading edge pops up to Rana at backward point. Simple catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Nitish Rana b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! Disastrous start from {{TEAM}}. Dream start for RPS. A gentle floater first-up from {{BOWLER}}, on a good length and well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} went for the drive, can't keep it down and it's a simple catch for Tiwary - at short extra-cover. Delight amongst the crowd, despair for the {{TEAM}} supporters. {{BATSMAN}} c Manoj Tiwary b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! Faf is making a habit of pulling off these boundary-flirting catches and he makes it look so easy. {{BATSMAN}} is disappointed and he knew he was in trouble from the moment it left the bat. Huge wicket for CSK. {{BATSMAN}} danced down the track and perhaps got a little too close to the pitch of the delivery, miscues the loft off the toe-end, it did seem like going for a maximum but there's always a risk involved when you take on a fielder like Faf. He Leaps up full length, grabs the ball on the jump and quickly realizes, he's gonna go over the ropes. What does he do then? Just maintains his composure, lobs the ball in the air before going over the ropes and collects the ball with ease on the second attempt. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 28(29) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mujeeb!! Wow! Is this the game-changing over from {{BOWLER}}? He's gotten rid of both the set-batsmen in this over and {{BATSMAN}} is livid with himself as he thuds his bat onto his pads. But doesn't matter because he's played a fabulous knock here. The Hyderabad crowd gives him a rousing reception. It was the round-arm darter from {{BOWLER}}, bowled it quick outside off. {{BATSMAN}} with a tired looking shot as he threw his bat and skews it up towards point, who takes a couple of steps back and grabs it. {{BATSMAN}} c Mujeeb b {{BOWLER}} 81(56) [4s-7 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mishra!! That's the pace of {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} is one of the finest pullers in India and still he's undone by the South African's speed. Dug in short and gets a nice lift on this, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the pull tad too late, the top-edge pops towards short fine leg and Mishra completes the formalities. Big wicket for DD at this stage of the game. They need few more to take control. {{BATSMAN}} c Mishra b {{BOWLER}} 10(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! A hint of uncertainity consumes Shane {{BATSMAN}}. He was on the back foot, trying to cut this off his off-stump but the ball doesn't turn as expected and grips a touch before crashing into off peg. Smart bowling from {{BOWLER}} as he landed it in line with off to keep {{BATSMAN}} honest. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 31(29) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Fiery response from {{BOWLER}}. Very impressive delivery from the youngster. It was full, it tailed in sharply and {{BATSMAN}} was all at sea as he falls over. Gets rapped on the pad, then it deflects onto the stumps. Unfortunate end to what's been a thoroughly entertaining knock from the South African captain. The ton was definitely there for the taking. Good sportsmanship from the bowler as he pats Faf on the back. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 96(55) [4s-10 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! What a horrible shot that is. It's a leg-break pitching on middle and leg, and {{BATSMAN}} is still trying to manufacture a cut through point. The zip from {{BOWLER}} fizzes the ball right through him and knocks over the top of leg-stump. Really poor shot selection. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Naman Ojha!! Had he let that go it would have been deemded as a wide. Seeing the batsman back away, {{BOWLER}} darts one well outside off from a good length. {{BATSMAN}} has to reach out for it with a stretched arms. In the end, nicks it into the mitts of Naman Ojha who collects it with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Naman Ojha b {{BOWLER}} 5(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Vijay Shankar! Half-volley on off, {{BATSMAN}} swings through the line, once again gets far too much height and hardly any distance, holes out to Vijay Shankar running in from long-off. That ball must have little drops of heaven on it by now, the number of times it has crosses the earth's atmosphere tonight. {{BATSMAN}} c Vijay Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! {{BOWLER}} strikes now. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Maiden IPL wicket for {{BOWLER}}. Nice comeback, young man. Long way to go! Bowls the wrong 'un, gets it to spin away outside off. {{BATSMAN}} tries to do an encore, didn't sort of get into a good position and morever had to fetch it from outside off. Ends up dragging it onto the stumps via an inside edge. {{BOWLER}} is upbeat and a crucial wicket for Punjab as {{BATSMAN}} - the dangerman departs. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 31(29) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! {{BATSMAN}} absolutely belted that but hits it straight into the hands of Rohit Sharma at mid-wicket. Sharp reflexes from Rohit though, a meter to the right or left of him would have been a boundary. But this sport is all about few centimeters. And this dismissal was just a vindication of that. It was a back of a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} got a lot of willow behind the pull shot but when luck is not going your way you tend to find fielders. And that's exactly what happened there with {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 16(21)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! Full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} has a go, only to get it through off the outside edge. This wasn't in his arc to hit outta the park. Well bowled by {{BOWLER}} who lets out some steam in his celebrations, probably still angry with himself for the previous wide. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 7(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Needless! This is a gift from {{TEAM}}. Never a second in it and {{BATSMAN}} is well short of the crease. The CSK fans at Wankhede explode. Short of length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} jumps and tucks it backward of square leg, he wanted the second and pushed Dhawan for it, Karn ran in from long leg and fired a flat throw right next to the stumps, easy peasy for Dhoni. {{BATSMAN}} was couple of yards short. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Karn Sharma/Dhoni) 5(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! That's a brilliant running catch from {{BOWLER}}. The slog was miscued by {{BATSMAN}}, it went a long way up in the night sky and was about to land in no man's land. But {{BOWLER}} for some seconds became Usain Bolt, he charged towards mid-wicket, just about reached it and takes it wonderfully well in the end. But a brilliant cameo from {{BATSMAN}}! {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 25(10) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} has got the wicket that might just seal things for RCB tonight. The crowd goes mum. Slower ball on off, {{BATSMAN}} launches into the heave. Swings the bat too early and the ball scoots under to uproot the off-stump. {{BOWLER}} roars and alongside him roar the millions of RCB fans who finally have a reason to celebrate. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 45(34) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Vijay Shankar!! Kumar strikes! Half the GL side are back in the hut now. {{BATSMAN}} runs out of patience, decides to take on Bhuvi. It was a slower delivery and the West Indian didn't pick it. Was early into the shot and went through it, skews it off the toe-end and slices it towards deep mid-wicket. Vijay Shankar, the sub, runs to his left and pouched it safely. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Vijay Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 37(27) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Narine Run Out!! Oh no! What have you done {{BATSMAN}}? {{TEAM}} didn't need this against the run of play. Slower delivery is nurdled in front of fine leg, {{BATSMAN}} is always looking for the second but he should know his partners well, Narine is not the swiftest and he's relcutant to go but does so after seeing his skipper next to him. Aaron throws to the bowler's end and Narine is nowhere near the frame. Narine run out (Aaron/Rahane) 11(8) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rohit!! Mumbai pacers on fire again. And not for the first time in this tournament has {{BATSMAN}} been dismissed after being rushed on the pull. So after a great start, he's had three successive failures. The ball just comes onto him quicker than expected as he camps on the front foot. Spoons it up off the splice to mid-on. Royals losing this match in a hurry. {{BATSMAN}} c Rohit b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. A mix-up between the openers and Mayank has to depart. Brilliant stop by Warner at mid-off though. He sprinted across and stopped the drive with a dive. Mayank was committed for the second, but Rahul sends him back. And by the time he can react, Warner's throw is already at the bowler's end. That's that for {{BATSMAN}} tonight, then. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Warner/{{BOWLER}}) 9(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} says \"It's mine\" and he makes no mistake. Charges out of his crease and clatters it, nowhere off the middle, it hung in the air for long and {{BOWLER}} had it covered. Caught it around the cover region. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Saha!! {{BOWLER}} gets the breakthrough and he is absolutely loving the celebrations, mimics a phone ring as soon as he sees Saha gather the catch. Bowled it in that uncertainty channel outside off and caught {{BATSMAN}} poking at it sans any conviction, a thick edge and Saha does the rest. {{BATSMAN}} c Saha b {{BOWLER}} 8(10) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Smith!! Smith has pulled off a stunner! And, {{BATSMAN}} can't register his sixth successive fifty. A pacy short of length delivery from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} had backed away to slap it away. A hint of extra bounce and hence {{BATSMAN}} couldn't time it as well as he would liked it to. The ball ballooned up and Smith ran back and to his right from mid-off before putting a full-stretched dive. He kept his eyes on the ball and completed a superb catch. Snaffled it with both hands and ensured that the ball didn't pop out when his elbows made contact with the ground. A much-needed breakthrough for the hosts. {{BATSMAN}} c Smith b {{BOWLER}} 37(32)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Harbhajan!! Second wicket for Watto and a much-needed one for CSK. {{BOWLER}} doesn't deviate from his tried and tested ploy which is to dig it short at a subtle, slower pace, {{BATSMAN}} falls into the trap and mistimes the pull into the mitts of Bhajji at long leg. A set trap this and {{BATSMAN}} departs after an entertaining knock. {{BATSMAN}} c Harbhajan b {{BOWLER}} 43(29) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Miller!! Charges out, slams it down the ground and Miller makes amends for the drop by taking a good catch here. Miller covered some good ground to his left, then put in the sli{{BATSMAN}} with his knees dug into the ground and plucked it out of thin air. KXIP making this game their own with a couple of good catches here. {{BATSMAN}} c Miller b {{BOWLER}} 24(23) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Bairstow!! There is the edge.. Bairstow takes it neatly in front of his face and Bhuvi strikes in his first over. Got extra lift on this outswinger, beautiful seam presentation as it nibbles away outside off. {{BATSMAN}} with zero feet movement chases and nicks it behind. Early jitters in the {{TEAM}} camp. {{BATSMAN}} c Bairstow b {{BOWLER}} 2(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tahir! A sigh of relief, as the breakthrough arrives! Looks like the topspinner, that straightened naturally a little from the over the wicket angle, {{BATSMAN}} charges down the wicket to loft it out of Punjab (Udta Punjab?) slices it high in the air and Tahir at extra cover settles under it. {{BATSMAN}} c Tahir b {{BOWLER}} 71(36) [4s-7 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mayank Agarwal!! This was coming! {{BATSMAN}} was struggling to get the young Afghan away, goes for the big mow over mid-wicket and holes out to long-on. He didn't pick this wrong 'un, came down the track, didn't get anywhere close to the ball, was eyeing the mid-wicket fence, got a fat leading edge on the lofted drive, high and towards long-on. Mayank settled under it and holds on. {{BATSMAN}} c Mayank Agarwal b {{BOWLER}} 28(29) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! This was coming, {{BATSMAN}} was getting edgy with every dot delivery - this was the wrong 'un, slower and spinning back into the right-hander, think {{BATSMAN}} picked it as he rocked back on the pull - beaten by the lack of pace, went through with the shot a fraction too early and ended up losing his off-stump. But he has played his role, not a bad first knock at the IPL. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 39(35) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Now he's set him up beautifully. Fired the last one flatter and quicker, and bowls this loopier. {{BATSMAN}}, to his credit, looked to have middled it - well, it sounded like that - but he finds the deep mid-wicket fielder like how you would when things aren't going your way. A struggle of an innings, coming on the day {{TEAM}} least required it. Where from here for {{TEAM}}? {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 12(15) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! There's that early wicket that {{BOWLER}} is so used to. Takes three balls to take his first wicket in IPL. {{BATSMAN}} preempts the reverse-sweep but loses his balance altogether in doing so. {{BOWLER}} ripped the ball a little extra with his index finger, meaning the ball was drifting in and gaining pace off the deck. Skids on and pins {{BATSMAN}} on the thigh. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 4(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahane!! And when Pant's extravaganza doesn't consume him, {{BATSMAN}}'s cheek will. So he tries to be cute, with a late fine sweep past the keeper. But in his pre-guessing, gets a little too early into it and the length's just too full for it as well, resulting in a glove, popping up off his shoulder to a very-alert Rahane - at slip - who runs to where a leg-slip would've been. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahane b {{BOWLER}} 12(23)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Wow! This is excellent bowling from {{BOWLER}}. After all those away-going deliveries, he gets one to shape in. {{BATSMAN}} shoulders arms and loses his off-stump. Top-class bowling. A goodish length from over the wicket and {{BATSMAN}} anticipating the ball swing away raised his bat. It was however,, the inswinger. Hits the top of off. {{TEAM}}'s best batsman this season departs for a cheap score. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 7(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Appeal for a run-out taken upstairs! It's a direct-hit, mind you. Looks very close. Although {{BATSMAN}} had put in a dive at the bowler's end, it's not enough. Touch and go! The batsman had driven the ball to Hooda at mid-off and a direct-hit at the bowler's end brings curtains to the South African's stay at the crease. Another awful start for {{TEAM}} this season. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Hooda) 1(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samuels!! Catching practice for Samuels and {{BATSMAN}} falls after a fine knock. Relief on the faces of the Daredevils fielders, this was short and on the stumps - asking to be smacked. {{BATSMAN}} shuffled inside the line and was looking to help it fine, went off the middle and straight into the pouch of Samuels - at short fine leg. He doesn't drop those, juggles and takes it on the second attempt. {{BATSMAN}} walks off to a good ovation. {{BATSMAN}} c Samuels b {{BOWLER}} 66(43) [4s-5 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rayudu!! A fine low catch by Rayudu brings an end to {{BATSMAN}}'s cameo. Slightly up outside off and {{BATSMAN}} plays an uppish drive straight to the man stationed at cover. Looks skyward does the batsman as he's disappointed at his dismissal. Was looking for a boundary and has perished in the process. {{BATSMAN}} c Rayudu b {{BOWLER}} 27(16) [6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! WWWWW -- IPL debut you say! It's easier than an EA Sports Cricket '07 debut. He needed Malinga to return home, and he's perhaps even nudged him further into Sri Lanka here. So it was the same old usual stuff, full, on middle and {{BATSMAN}}'s tried funky scoop does him no good. Only uproots middle. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! And {{BOWLER}} has his man.. Brave bowling from the youngster. He was not afraid to toss it up even after getting hit for a six. It was the wrong 'un and Mo could not reach the pitch of the ball, still swings through the line and is beaten by the away turn. A nice little cameo but {{TEAM}} needed more than a cameo here. {{BATSMAN}} st Pant b {{BOWLER}} 32(18) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nitish Rana!! A slight misjudgement from Rana in the deep but he's recovered really well here. The umpires want to have a second look. But I think the catch was clean enough. Soft signal is out, and we will stay with out. A back of a length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} slogs it across the line and hits it flat and straight towards deep square leg. Rana is slightly guilty of sleeping on it. He doesn't really move from his position, expecting it to carry comfortably, and has to dive forward in the end. Snatches it right off the turf. {{BOWLER}} has struck first ball of a new spell. MI needed that. {{BATSMAN}} c Nitish Rana b {{BOWLER}} 60(34) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Uthappa!! The umpire took ages to raise his finger. Perhaps, it looked like he had a look at his partner before making the decision. The partnership is broken, courtesy short ball down leg. {{BATSMAN}} would have smacked that past the ropes nine times out of ten. But, not today. He attempted the pull and all he managed was a glove onto it. Uthappa moves to his left and pouches it. {{BATSMAN}} c Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 21(17) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Lewis!! {{BATSMAN}} holes out in the deep. The slower ball does the trick. It was bowled at 120kph and {{BATSMAN}} didn't pick that. Covered the line and moved across to flick. Plays a touch too early and that leads to his downfall. Off the lower protion of the bat. The ball settles straight into the hands of Lewis at long leg. Straightforward catch. Mumbai have the breakthrough! {{BATSMAN}} c Lewis b {{BOWLER}} 16(14) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Cutting!! That surely should be the game. Two in two for MI. Fantastic catch from Cutting. Short delivery angled across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} had to fetch the pull and all he could manage was a toe-end towards deep square leg, Cutting had to cover a lot of ground, he got there and slid across to complete the catch. He was out in similar fashion in the previous game as well. Problem area for {{BATSMAN}}? {{BATSMAN}} c Cutting b {{BOWLER}} 21(19) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! \"Ahhhh, ahhhhh\" goes Pant and S Ravi raises his finger. A big blow for Pune. Stunned silence in the crowd. {{BATSMAN}} tried to be too cheeky, went low to play the scoop over the keeper's head. Gets a faint tickle and Pant nestles it into the gloves. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 8(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mandeep!! They are falling apart. Three wickets in the span of six balls. All the momentum that seemed to have drifted Pune's way has surely been redirected via the national highway to Bangalore. A fullish delivery this and full-paced as well for a change. {{BATSMAN}} executes the clip but fails to keep it down. Doesn't get it high enough either. The middle path treaded takes the lob into the safe palms of deep square leg. {{BATSMAN}} c Mandeep b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Gone. {{BOWLER}} is shushing {{BATSMAN}} as he puts his finger to his lips. Magnificent bowling. Done {{BATSMAN}} in with his quickish, flattish leggie, {{BATSMAN}} was down the track and looking to play across the line, dangerous, deadly dangerous when it spins past you like that leaving you hopeless and helpless. Easy for de Kock to complete the formalities. {{BOWLER}} is jumping up and down like a young child who has been denied his icecream. {{BATSMAN}} st de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 9(7) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Priyam Garg!! {{BOWLER}}, rare loop, rarer flight and a Rishabh {{BATSMAN}} freaky sweep -- mix it, and a disaster's a certainty. So it starts with {{BATSMAN}} premeditatingly shuffling across his stumps, {{BOWLER}} tossing it up on leg-stump, extracting bounce, getting the top-edge and going down deep square leg's throat. {{BATSMAN}} c Priyam Garg b {{BOWLER}} 28(27) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} strikes and the customary celebrations follow! DK had a great domestic season, looked decent thus far in this IPL, but not today. He was shaping up to cut, perhaps didn't expect Imran {{BOWLER}} to fire in a googly. Result? He ends up chopping it back onto his stumps, off the inside edge obviously. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Morris!! How often have we seen this? A batsman throwing it away after reaching the milestone. {{BATSMAN}} uses his feet, looks to go straight and throws his weight into the lofted hit over mid-off, he seemed to have got enough height on that but Morris set himself cleverly on the edge of the long-off boundary to claim a well-judged catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Morris b {{BOWLER}} 50(32) [4s-8]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Smith!! The googly gets the powerhitter here. Slashes at the away going ball and ends up edging it. The slip fielder had to react quickly and he did so to pouch it. RR have finally something worth celebrating. It was supposed to be a tough wicket to bat on but {{BATSMAN}} had other ideas tonight. Going back to that ball, it was slightly flatter that googly. {{BATSMAN}} c Smith b {{BOWLER}} 47(25) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nair!! That was middled to perfection, but right to the fielder near the fence at the same time. Shortish delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} picks the length early and pulls it nicely but Nair stationed at deep square leg moves to his right and reverse cups it just near the fence. {{BATSMAN}} fails to capitalise on the start as Royals lose their third wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Nair b {{BOWLER}} 28(23) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manish Pandey!! Gone! The partnership has been broken. But it might be a good thing for Rajasthan. {{BATSMAN}} has done his job - setting it up for the likes of Stokes and Gowtham. He shimmies down and is deceived by {{BOWLER}}'s dragged back length, still goes through with the loft and gets more height than distance, Pandey takes it easily near long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Manish Pandey b {{BOWLER}} 70(49) [4s-4 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned up! {{BOWLER}} has his man. The partnership has been broken but the damage has been done. The slower delivery from {{BOWLER}}, rolled his fingers across the ball at the last second, {{BATSMAN}} goes on his knee to play the slog sweep but is through the shot early, the ball clips the inside edge brushes his thigh and ends up on the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 37(25) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} doesn't want to go. But he has to. He has been bowled here. He can't believe that the ball has hit the stumps. Superb googly, tossed up and invited {{BATSMAN}} to play the big shot. An almighty hoick to leg but only after the ball has missed the inside edge and clipped the top of middle and leg. Top-class bowling. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 14(10) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Uthappa!! End of an entertaining knock. Rohit knows the value of it. He pats {{BATSMAN}}'s back as the latter walks off. Premeditated slog-sweep goes wrong this time, as he didn't generate sufficient power. He dragged it straight down Uthappa's throat at deep backward square leg. Takes just in front of the boundary rope. {{BATSMAN}} c Uthappa b {{BOWLER}} 62(21) [4s-5 6s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Lovely delivery from {{BOWLER}} and he gets rid of the dangerous {{BATSMAN}}. This was very full and on the stumps, bowled at 143 kmph. Not quite the yorker, but good enough for {{BATSMAN}}, he was making room for the slog, gets a bottom-edge and the ball clatters into the base of middle-stump. A send off from the youngster and KKR get their first wicket. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 33(18) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Maxwell!! {{BOWLER}} pumps his fist. {{BATSMAN}} hangs his head down and trudges off. The Mumbai supporters are in shock. That must be the match? The slower delivery and it was right in the arc, but the slow nature made {{BATSMAN}} generate all the power and he could only heave it as far as deep mid-wicket. Maxwell keeps his cool and takes it calmly. Settled nicely under it. {{BATSMAN}} c Maxwell b {{BOWLER}} 37(20) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Stumping appeal, this looks close. Has he stepped out? Front foot is fine. His back foot is out but has he got it back in time? Zoomer comes in. Looks out to me, not sure about the man upstairs. He wants to check all the angles. Might just be in the air. Out that is and the roar tells me Kotla has shifted to Bangalore. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to swing this one out of the park after stepping down, {{BOWLER}}'s darter was too good to be meted with that kind of a treatment. {{BATSMAN}} st Vishnu Vinod b {{BOWLER}} 21(9) [4s-3 6s-1][/b]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! The other {{BOWLER}} gets into the act! Just two balls to take the wicket and it's another vital one as {{BATSMAN}} can be dangerous. This was slider and kept a trifle low perhaps as he tried to whip-pull across the line. Once he missed it, there was no doubt on the LBW. As plumb as it gets and {{BATSMAN}} knew it too as he continued the walk to the dugout. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 11(6) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! Stunner from QDK! Brilliance from the South African and that's the end of a forgettable night for {{BATSMAN}}. Made room for the big shot but this was in the blockhole, cramped him as well and he got a faint inside edge. De Kock was initially blinded, as keepers usually are in such a scenario, but reacted sharply with a two-handed diving catch to his left. Excellent work indeed and that's the third of the night for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 8(9) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! That's the curtains for {{BATSMAN}} and his affair with the Eden. A brave call this - quite a few doubts on the first impression but boy o boy, ump Ravi has turned around his form from the earlier goof up. A sharp in-cutter from {{BOWLER}}, at nippy pace as well. Jags back in from a length to just about go past the bat searching for the defence and take the front pad. On top of middle shows HawkEye. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 27(21) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! Wickets keep coming for {{BOWLER}} and this is his trademark celebration on show. Pushed through with a flatter trajectory, {{BATSMAN}} bent down on the slog-sweep, struck it hard and flat, but didn't find the placement that he wanted. Shardul was the man at deep backward square leg, bends down low and accepts the catch gleefully. Exit {{BATSMAN}}, but enter Andre Russell. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 82(51) [4s-7 6s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Bull's eye! {{BOWLER}} cleans up {{BATSMAN}} with a full toss as the batsman backs away to smash the ball away. At the speed of which {{BOWLER}} is bowling, it's never so easy. The leg stump is uprooted but Rajashtan have managed to post an excellent score of 191/6. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Two big wickets within a span of three balls. This will hurt the defending champions. Piyush {{BOWLER}} gets the big fish. {{BATSMAN}} probably misjudged the length. Did that keep low? Not sure. It was a slider from a good length, {{BATSMAN}} went back to pull it away. Misses it by a long way and the ball crashes the middle stump. Gauti is animated in his celebration. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 37(35) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Gone! Just the wicket they were looking for. He was playing so well, there was no need to play the reverse sweep. Actually the reverse heave. {{BOWLER}} goes very full and the batsman gets beaten and rapped on the pads. The impact was around middle and this might have gone on to crash into the off-stump. Nevertheless, this was also the highest opening wicket stand for Delhi since 2016. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 35(27) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Oh no! Unfortunate! Tossed up temptingly on middle, angling in from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and tries to go through with the slog-sweep to negate the spin, ends up getting an inside edge onto his thigh, which then ricochets onto the off-stump. On another night, it might have missed the wickets, but the stars up above aren't aligned for him tonight. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 37(22) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The zings light up. The crowd refuses to believe and keep searching for the ball. Nope, that's the end of the fun in store folks. {{BOWLER}} for a change aims for the stumps, going slower as well. Nicely off the back of the hand and foxes him with the seam position. A swat across the line is missed eventually and the top of leg takes the brunt. This has been some serious clock roll back here. Makes me feel 10 years younger. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 62(27) [4s-7 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Oh yeah, Robbie will be a relieved man! His prayers have worked, and the dropped catch hasn't cost much. {{BOWLER}} sticks to his slower ones and he has managed to knock down {{BATSMAN}}. Rolled his fingers, pitched this one on a good length. {{BATSMAN}} like always, swings and misses. Failed to get him in his previous over, but has managed to get his man eventually. First wicket for {{BOWLER}} this season. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 15(14) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shami!! This was coming - {{BATSMAN}} was being tied down and he falls while trying for that big hit - picked the wrong 'un as he went down on the sweep, couldn't roll his wrists over and ended up swiping it in the air. Shami was the man running across to his right from deep backward square leg, gets himself into a good position and holds on. {{TEAM}} are stuttering once again in the middle overs. {{BATSMAN}} c Shami b {{BOWLER}} 18(22) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! That is {{BOWLER}}'s wicket. Full marks for slowing it down and getting purchase from the wicket, which brought about {{BATSMAN}}'s downfall. He had swept {{BOWLER}} last over for a big six over mid-wicket, but this turns slightly and the top edge goes straight up. This time into the hands of {{BOWLER}}. Just when {{BATSMAN}} was looking dangerous he gets out. Has been the story of his life. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 35(19) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BATSMAN}} is bowled to a spinner. Seen that so often in this IPL. I can recollect Mujeeb, Rashid and now {{BOWLER}}. The bowler does a cool fist pump to celebrate the wicket. {{BATSMAN}} knew he had to do something against {{BOWLER}}, struggled in the first over, and decided to step out, but cleverly bowled by {{BOWLER}}, going wide of the crease and darting in a fast offie, which breaks in through the bat-pad gap to take {{BATSMAN}}'s off stump out. They check for the no-ball on the side crease, but {{BOWLER}} had his leg up in the air and didn't land. A body blow to {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Agarwal Run Out! Already a slower one @116.8km/h on a good length, {{BATSMAN}} delays a transfer-of-weight punch to Dhawan, and Agarwal tries to recover after backing up, but a direct-hit from Dhawan (and a thigh slap to follow it up) with one stump to aim at, has sent Agarwal packing! Fantastic throw by Dhawan, and certainly nothing iffy about that dismissal, with {{TEAM}} on the receiving end this time. Just a moment of brilliance. Agarwal run out (Dhawan) 6(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! Howrah bridge is falling down. Without repair. After the softening blow, {{BOWLER}} goes for his ideal sucker delivery. Full, slowed up and {{BATSMAN}} once again looks to use the pace with his lofted slog. Nope, none of it coming this time. Flies off the cue-end down the throat of deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 6(4) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} strikes. The experiment of sending Patel up the order fails. It was the googly from {{BOWLER}}, wasn't quite short. Patel went for the encore, not the ideal length. He misses and the ball rattles the stumps. {{BOWLER}} exults! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 9(6) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! This time Kedar Jadhav appealed and so did {{BOWLER}}, the umpire obliges to their plea. Nothing but a short of length delivery angled across the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} pulled and got an under edge to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 6(4) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Boult!! Mumbai have been knocked out. Cutting and Rohit take a moment to soak in what has transpired. The Mumbai skipper then gathers himself and shakes hands with his team mates. It is only the fourth time that Mumbai have not made the playoffs. Some happy faces in the Delhi camp as they finish with back to back wins. Another slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} had to go for it, miscued it towards long-on and Boult ran in to complete the catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Boult b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Has {{BATSMAN}} been stumped? de Kock certainly seems confident. It's a fair delivery, the bat is in the air, {{BATSMAN}} is way short as well and he's OUT. That's the end of a mighty fine cameo from the {{TEAM}} captain, will it be the clinching factor in this match? Smart bowling from {{BOWLER}}, sensed that {{BATSMAN}} was coming down the track, threw in a loopy leg-break, {{BATSMAN}} came down the track, doesn't get anywhere near the ball, swung across the line in hope and missed, de Kock did the rest. {{BATSMAN}} st de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 33(21) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Relay stuff. Executed to perfection. Dhoni adds a few more to his tally. For the first time in this over, {{BOWLER}} goes full and gives {{BATSMAN}} the opportunity to swing his arms. And he cannot resist. Throws his hands out, toe ends it and Dan, at first slip reverse cups of some sort and the pop out is plucked out by the keeper. Ah, kind. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 10(17)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rayudu!! Scoops up a length ball which bounced a touch higher and the man at point takes it. That got big on him, {{BATSMAN}} could not keep it down and the man at point took an easy catch. {{TEAM}} have been poor at the death. {{BATSMAN}} c Rayudu b {{BOWLER}} 5(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Unadkat!! Oh dear! What are Punjab doing here, self-destruction of the highest order. It was a short ball at the body, {{BATSMAN}} was hurried by the extra pace as he wanted to pull it, but the ball got big on him and he ends up slicing it. Unadakat from mid-wicket goes back and takes a brilliant catch, it is never easy taking such catches, but Unadkat made it look easy. {{BATSMAN}} c Unadkat b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Got him. That's scooted through to shatter the stumps as {{BATSMAN}} lines up a pull. Darted in short, {{BATSMAN}} expects the ball to get up so he can pummel it into the stands. Not quite. RCB can chew the leftovers of their carcass. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 50(22) [4s-5 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! What is happening there. {{BATSMAN}} is gone. Stephen Fleming in the dug-out has a sorry look on his face. {{BATSMAN}} goes on the back foot to play a full ball. It is a reminiscence of what happened in Australia close to a decade ago. {{BOWLER}} is not as quick as Brett Lee but has enough venom to catch him in front. The ball would have crashed on to the leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Finch!! Skipper strikes! Lovely stuff from Ash, didn't get great turn on this but ensured there's no pace and made KP fetch for that by tossing it far of off-stump; KP made room and went hard with his flat-bat swing, straight into the pocket of Finchy at wide long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Finch b {{BOWLER}} 50(23) [4s-5 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! The full swinging in delivery does it again. A hint of reverse and the batsman again misses trying to play across the line of the sticks. He was as dead a as a dodo. That delivery was quick as well and didn't allow the batsman to bring his bat down in time. NCN vindicates his skipper's decision to bring him back. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 47(34) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{TEAM}} are bowled out with a ball to spare. The slower ball is too good for {{BATSMAN}}. He gives a mighty swing and connects thin air. The ball cannons onto the stumps and the Lions finish on 161. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by R Tripathi!! Holes out this time! Gee, some seriously high skiers tonight and RR are doing well to get under them without spilling. {{BOWLER}} gets his third and not surprisingly, it's with another slower ball. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to up the ante, rightfully so, but could not middle this loft at all. Tripathi at long-off does well to take it with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c R Tripathi b {{BOWLER}} 17(6) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Y Pathan!! Brings about his end. In the quest of going hard after everything. Another low dipping full toss this and {{BATSMAN}} swings, hard abut has to do with just a toe end. Only the height, not the distance. As far as a back-pedalling cover at the edge of the circle. Not quite the assualt from {{BATSMAN}} tonight. {{BATSMAN}} c Y Pathan b {{BOWLER}} 13(11) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Drilled through the covers again, and flies full-length in trying to get back in for the second as well. But Manish's throw is flat, bang on top of the stumps. Yea, he's an AB on the field. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Manish Pan{{BATSMAN}}y/Bairstow) 51(30) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Huge wicket! Just like Rahul, {{BATSMAN}} is also beaten for pace in his first ball against {{BOWLER}} and the young lad has knocked the Aussie off. Superb stuff and he is pumped up. Back of a length outside off, clocked 148.7kph and it did seem really fast off the surface as well. {{BATSMAN}} too didn't help his cause as he just tried to use his hands to lift this away down the ground. Wasn't there for that shot, not with this kind of pace and he was late as well. Popped an easy catch towards extra cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! {{BOWLER}}'s come back superbly. He's spotted {{BATSMAN}} advance down the pitch, and so he's fired this well wide outside off to beat him. Samson completes a nice stumping. {{BATSMAN}} st Samson b {{BOWLER}} 54(27) [4s-8 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! Wow! What a moment in the match. Stokes you beauty! David de Gea would have been proud of that effort. It was a short of length delivery wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} cuts and cuts hard. It was in the air, Stokes flies in the air, times the jump to perfection and pulls off a stunning catch. Catch for the ages! He charges towards third man and punches the air in delight. Such moments can change the match, such moments can turn around the tournament for your team. {{TEAM}} are in huge huge trouble now. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 1(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Akshdeep Nath!! The juicy long hop does what a bunch of tight lines couldn't. {{BOWLER}} drags his length back, and {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes light up in a big agricultural mow getting deep in the crease. However, gets a big fat top-edge, and Akshdeep at cow corner, after all the initial misjudgement is sitting under. {{BATSMAN}} c Akshdeep Nath b {{BOWLER}} 28(22) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik {{BOWLER}}!! Two wickets in the over. {{BATSMAN}} falls cheaply. This was floated up much fuller from KP, tempting {{BATSMAN}} to go for the big shot. The Karnataka batsman went after it, albeit didn't find the sweet spot in his willow. Skies it as far as deep mid-wicket, where his brother Hardik swallows it up with ease. {{BOWLER}} roars in joy and sprints up to his brother and leaps onto him. What a start for Mumbai. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 4(3) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Chris Morris!! No no no! What are you doing Jinx? Not too short, no turn, but a little too quick and skiddy. {{BATSMAN}} is stuck between and pull and a flick with a bit of a swat and gets a leading edge towards Morris at point to hand him a mango dolly. {{BATSMAN}} c Chris Morris b {{BOWLER}} 45(40) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Samson!! Another catch for Samson and another wicket for {{BOWLER}}. This was another leg-break, bowled slower and on the middle-stump line. {{BATSMAN}} swung across in hope, he had to manufacture all the power himself, doesn't get the elevation either. Samson moves across to his right at deep mid-wicket and takes the offering. The umpire has called for a strategic break with just one wicket remaining. Not sure what the two teams will talk about over the next 150 seconds. {{BATSMAN}} c Samson b {{BOWLER}} 5(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That's that for {{BATSMAN}}, he was very circumscept, but the finishing touches never came. The leg-break from {{BOWLER}}, skids through after pitching, {{BATSMAN}} was cramped for room on the pull, went through with the shot, the ball grazed the inside edge and the off-stump is on the floor. The Royals have never got going tonight, the Sunrisers have been all over them. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by U Yadav!! There's the wicket for RCB - ends an outstanding knock from {{BATSMAN}}. It's not a no-ball, so {{BOWLER}} can relax, the leg-break, slower and turning away from off, {{BATSMAN}} was down on his knees as he hoicked, gets a thick top-edge, it looped in the air and looked like was falling short of backward point. Umesh charged in athletically, dived forward with both hands and holds on. A standing ovation as {{BATSMAN}} walks away. {{BATSMAN}} c U Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 114(56) [4s-12 6s-7]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Williamson!! {{BATSMAN}} runs out of patience. Frustrated with a flurry of mistimed strokes he decides to smash this over cover and could only chip it inside the ring. Williamson runs to his left from cover and times his slide to perfection to claim a fine catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Williamson b {{BOWLER}} 51(47) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The perfect riposte from {{BOWLER}}, saw {{BATSMAN}} backing away and then went straight with the yorker - right at the base of off-stump. Try as much as he could, {{BATSMAN}} was never going to dig this one out - the zing bails go flying and the Sunrisers have lost their fourth wicket. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 28(27) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! That's quick stuff @144km/h. {{BOWLER}} is no sulker! No LBW? No problem. Leave nothing to the umpire. Length delivery, seaming in just enough, {{BATSMAN}} tries to loft through the line, gets an inside edge onto his pad and it finally ricochets onto his stumps. Huge breakthrough for the Mumbaikars, as their stump-vanquisher uproots the sticks of the Big Show one last time. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 22(18) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Washington Sundar!! Gone! {{BOWLER}} wins the final battle. Struck for a four and a six and the local boy responds with the wicket of {{BATSMAN}}. Very big moment at this stage. Slower ball that is dragged back on seeing {{BATSMAN}} move across his stumps, the scoop lacks power or pace and Sundar completes a dolly near short fine leg. {{BATSMAN}} c Washington Sundar b {{BOWLER}} 11(7) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! The crowd are stunned. A hush of silence and disappointment descends on the Chinnaswamy. Their favorite son of the non-soil is gone. Ok - I made that up. Back to the wicket. This was another cutter on a short of length, trouble was {{BATSMAN}} looking to power it over long-on off the front foot. Such a difficult shot that one - even if you are {{BATSMAN}}. He holes out to long-on. Polly won't drop that. {{BATSMAN}} is shocked to say the least, makes his emotions known before trudging off. That's a difference of at least 20 in my book. Now {{BOWLER}} suddenly is on a hat-trick. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 32(26) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhawan!! Dhawan has claimed a catch. {{BATSMAN}} isn't going anywhere. The third umpire will have a look, the soft call is OUT. He has caught it cleanly, but has the ball touched the ground or did Dhawan get his fingers underneath it? The zoomer has been called for, it looks tricky, but the soft signal is OUT. If there's no conclusive evidence, it will stay with the on-field call. The third umpire is taking numerous looks at it. B2$ is the call. {{TEAM}} have lost two of their overseas batting stars now. Coming to the ball, it was banged short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was rocking back on the pull, went low of the bat and looped towards mid-wicket. The ball was dying in front of him, but Dhawan does well to dive forward and holds onto it. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhawan b {{BOWLER}} 31(21) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Naman Ojha!! Two wickets in two overs and {{TEAM}} are losing gas towards the end. A short ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} went across his sticks and tried to lap/scoop it over short fine, doesn't succeed as he gets a faint nick and Ojha takes a simple catch. {{BATSMAN}} c Naman Ojha b {{BOWLER}} 30(32) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! That's the catch of this season so far. KL Rahul is absolutely pumped, he thumps his chest and lets out a few emotions. Well, it's been a game full of emotions thus far. This was full and angling away from {{BATSMAN}} outside off, he went for the lofted hit over extra cover but ended up skewing it off the cue end. KL Rahul from long-off covered a lot of miles to his left and never lost the sight of the ball, dived full length and caught it air-borne with two hands. I'm told he nearly ran 50 metres to catch that. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 20(16) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! He got smashed in the first over, but he's got three wickets now. The widish delivery across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} mistimes the lofted drive over cover, hits it high and straight to long-off. Celebration time for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 7(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Udana!! {{BATSMAN}} looks to go big against {{BOWLER}} and he has found the man at long-off. Was a loopy legbreak around off and Robbie miscues it completely in his quest to clear the fence. Udana takes a comfortable catch in the deep and {{BOWLER}} has just bagged his second wicket of the match. Sunrisers were in a similar situation yesterday. 70/4 when two youngsters braved them out of trouble. {{BATSMAN}} c Udana b {{BOWLER}} 17(22) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught&Bowled!! What a catch by {{BOWLER}} on his followthrough, pranced forward in time to snaffle that inches off the ground. {{BATSMAN}} was early on the shot, was trying to work into the on-side and ended up spooning it back to the bowler, who was ready for the opportunity. {{BATSMAN}} c and b {{BOWLER}} 9(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned up! Two in two for {{BOWLER}}. Third in the game and he's delighted. On a hat-trick as well. Very poor from the experienced {{BATSMAN}}. Just had lost Faf and he tries to slog sweep this ball, it is slower through the air and beat {{BATSMAN}} for lack of pace, missed and the furniture is left in a mess. Wrong time for {{TEAM}} to lose wickets. Two new batsmen at the crease now, advantage KXIP. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 17(20) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! Ideal start for the hosts. A corker from Jaddu at backward point. Another outswinger and {{BATSMAN}} drives with hard hands. Only gets an outside edge that dips as it approached the backward point fielder. Don't think many would have taken it. But, Jadeja is one of the best fielders in world cricket. He swoops forward and takes a diving catch inches above the ground. {{BATSMAN}} asked the fielder and decided to walk off. But, the umpires wanted to be 100% sure and hence went upstairs. Legal ball and a clean catch. A 2-ball duck for the Rajasthan skipper. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik {{BOWLER}}!! {{BOWLER}} brothers come together to get rid of the Universe Boss! This is excellent captaincy from Rohit. He was brave enough to bring his left-arm spinner against {{BATSMAN}} and the man from Baroda hasn't disappointed him. It was wide of off and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to clobber it down the ground. Doesn't get it off the sweet spot and it went a long way up in the air. Hardik at long-on takes it with ease in the end. It wasn't the easiest of catches. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik {{BOWLER}} b {{BOWLER}} 40(24) [4s-3 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Manoj Tiwary!! This is an excellent catch! Brilliant work by the two fielders in the deep. A tag-team effort by Mayank Agarwal and Manoj Tiwary results in his down fall. {{BATSMAN}} came down the wicket and towered it to long-off where Mayank grabbed it and just as he was about to lose balance he parried it to Tiwary who comes running in from long-on and takes it. {{BATSMAN}} stands there in disbelief but he has to walk back. Was looking so good but nothing to take away from the fielders there. {{BATSMAN}} c Manoj Tiwary b {{BOWLER}} 12(9) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! Loud appeal for caught behind from the keeper, given. {{BOWLER}} did not look interested at first but joined later seeing the men from behind yell their throats out. Was a back of a length delivery that went across {{BATSMAN}}, who wanted to cut closer to his body. Top edges to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 7(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! A faint tickle off the outer edge and Karthik makes easy amends for the fluffed chance earlier. This is RS's sixth single digit score in the year's IPL. That was just a seam up delivery angling away and {{BATSMAN}} flirted at it to bring an end to his iffy knock. Is there a twist? {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 5(13)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shubman Gill!! It's no big secret that Punjab are way too top heavy, but KKR have successfully knocked out the snake's head. {{BOWLER}} - with another - lets out a nice back of a length sitter on the hips. {{BATSMAN}} lines up for a half-hearted swat as well, but the ball just doesn't come on. Ends up taking the upper half of the bat and picks out the only man out there, deep square leg. {{BATSMAN}} c Shubman Gill b {{BOWLER}} 14(14) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Jadeja!! {{BOWLER}}'s first wicket in the IPL is a huge one of {{BATSMAN}}. This is a match-changing event for sure. {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for the seamers to come on. And it was a given that he will go after them. He sets himself to slog this one out of the park. {{BOWLER}} again is smart enough to bowl an off-cutter. He gets the desired help from the deck and {{BATSMAN}}'s timing was in a mess on the slog. He could only hit it to deep mid-wicket and Jadeja there makes no mistake. He takes it with utmost ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Jadeja b {{BOWLER}} 55(47) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Southee!! {{BOWLER}} strikes with his very first ball. His introduction was too tempting for {{BATSMAN}}, who advanced down and wanted to loft it straight. But he gets too close to the pitch of it, and miscues it off the toe-end for a simple catch at long-off. Kohli explodes in celebration, probably even gave a send-off. Two new batsmen at the crease now. {{BATSMAN}} c Southee b {{BOWLER}} 42(27) [4s-7 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! {{BATSMAN}} does in fact look for the boundary. He walks across, bends his back knee and tries for the same scoop that Kedar Jadhav hit for six a few nights back against {{BOWLER}}. But what {{BATSMAN}} achieves is very different. He doesn't get it anywhere near the middle, and spoons it up to short fine leg. {{BOWLER}} raises his arms as the MI fans go wild. {{BATSMAN}} c Krunal Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}}'s poor run of form continues. He's hit on the back leg as {{BOWLER}} slides one on with the arm and the ball would have clipped leg-stump at least. {{BATSMAN}} wanted to cut loose here and unwinds a hefty swing looking to go downtown but was beaten on the inside edge by the slider. A good phase for Gujarat this. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 5(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Harbhajan!! Another one bites the dust. It was the googly from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} dragged that from outside off with his sweep shot. No timing behind it and he holes out at deep mid-wicket. Harbhajan gobbles it up above his head and has his arms aloft. {{BATSMAN}} c Harbhajan b {{BOWLER}} 4(12)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Southee!! Cross-seam length ball and has been slapped straight to the man at mid-off. Pretty much like Morris, {{BATSMAN}} also tried to power the ball down the ground but ended up hitting it straight to the fielder at mid-off. Still 3 needed. Some atrocious batting from {{TEAM}} again. {{BATSMAN}} c Southee b {{BOWLER}} 18(14) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by SN Thakur!! The short ball does it again. The batsman late on it as the ball bounced a tad bit more. In the end, the spliced up parabola was taken at mid-on. {{BATSMAN}} departs after yet another wonderful knock. {{BATSMAN}} c SN Thakur b {{BOWLER}} 62(46) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Finch!! There's something about {{BOWLER}}. Batsmen feel they can take him on but that has not been the case. First Pooran and now {{BATSMAN}}. Those are two big wickets especially in such a situation where they have to license to go after the bowling. {{BATSMAN}} backs away and takes a step down, {{BOWLER}} cleverly bangs the slower delivery into the surface, the flat-batted shot does not have the elevation to go over, Finch takes a good low catch at cover. {{BATSMAN}} c Finch b {{BOWLER}} 5(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! And he is gone. First IPL match for {{BOWLER}} and gets rewarded on the second ball. Karthik who takes a decent catch behind the stumps now becomes the first wicket-keeper in the IPL to register 100 dismissals. Here's what happened on this ball: just short of a good length that came in and might have left a bit off the deck to compel {{BATSMAN}} to have a feel for it. Enough to get the edge and fly to the right of Karthik. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out McClenaghan Run Out!! 1 run completed. All over. Gets low on his haunches and carves out the extravagant drive to extra cover. But the quest of wanting a non-existent second consumes another. A flat rocket arm throw from the deep, courtesy Stokes at the non-striker's end catches McClenaghan well short of his ground. McClenaghan run out (Stokes/{{BOWLER}}) 0(0)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Chopped on - Have to say this was coming, {{BATSMAN}} was never at home against {{BOWLER}} - short of a length and just outside off, a flat-footed {{BATSMAN}} aimed at the cut, cramped for room - all he managed was a big inside edge, the ball bounced back onto the off-stump and the lightened up bails signals {{BATSMAN}}'s sorry exit. {{TEAM}} have once again lost an early wicket in this season's tournament. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Two hat-tricks in a day. The IPL has gone mental. {{BATSMAN}} has absolutely no clue as {{BOWLER}} dips a knuckle ball into the blockhole and he ends up playing all around it. The ball sneaks through to knock leg-stump. {{BOWLER}} is absolutely pumped. It's a five-for as well! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Duminy!! That's a rank long hop and {{BATSMAN}} is gutted as he walks back to the hut. This was the attempted wrong 'un by {{BOWLER}}, dropped it way too short though, might have stuck slightly on the pitch, {{BATSMAN}} had to wait that extra second as he pulled, enough to mess up with his timing and he struck it hard, flat and straight to Duminy at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Duminy b {{BOWLER}} 24(20) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Ruturaj Gaikwad Run Out!! This is the last thing {{TEAM}} would've wanted at this stage. Needless. Patel lasers in the armer, {{BATSMAN}} is cramped for room as he inside-edges it towards square leg. Ruturaj was keen to get to the other end as he races across the pitch only for Faf to send him back. Pant quickly sprints across and flings in a sharp throw to the bowler. He put in a full-length dive but wasn't enough. {{BOWLER}} cleanly breaks the stumps and he's a goner! Ruturaj Gaikwad run out (Pant/{{BOWLER}}) 5(10)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Villiers!! ABD dives and ABD snaffles it. Kohli with the fist pump. It was a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} wanted to smash it over long-on. He hasn't timed it all evening and he failed to do so on this occassion also. ABD dives to his right emphatically and takes a beauty! {{BATSMAN}} c de Villiers b {{BOWLER}} 24(25) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Skiddy 143.4kph bumper into the ribs. {{BATSMAN}} had to go after everything, obviously it is the 20th over, and he tries a tennis-like-pull on this one. But can only mistime it to long-on, where Iyer, after misjudging, does well to dive in front to pluck it cleanly enough. {{BATSMAN}} c Shreyas Iyer b {{BOWLER}} 16(14) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dwayne Smith!! {{BATSMAN}} departs looking to play the full shot. It was in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} to slog it over long-on. He cleared his front leg, but unfortunately mistimed the tonk. Straight into the bucket hands of Smith at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Dwayne Smith b {{BOWLER}} 24(13) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Prasidh!! And {{BOWLER}} has the final laugh but the damage has been done. What a knock from {{BATSMAN}}. He's put {{TEAM}} in a prime position. {{BOWLER}} went round the wicket and slowed it up, {{BATSMAN}} sits low and attempts a big heave. Miscues it big time and skies it as far as long-on. Prasidh neatly settles under it and some respite for KKR. {{BATSMAN}} c Prasidh b {{BOWLER}} 66(28) [4s-5 6s-6]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! It's throwback to 2011 IPL finals. Ravi Ashwin got rid of {{BATSMAN}} in a similar fashion and 8 years later, Bhajji repeats it again. Big scalp for CSK and the crowd are delighted. {{BOWLER}} loads it up with flight, extracts some turn after pitching just outside off and {{BATSMAN}} wields his bat ungainly. Slight nick and MSD grabs it and knew it straightaway. Throws it up and {{BATSMAN}} is a goner. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 5(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The googly is very effective against the lower-order batsmen. Third wicket and all three with the googly. {{BATSMAN}} just swings through the line, misses the ball completely and has his sticks shattered. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sarfaraz Khan!! The bat face turned on impact and has been taken at {{BATSMAN}}ep cover. The googly has done it for {{BOWLER}}. ABD has problems against leggies and has been exposed once more. The run rate also had a role to play in the dismissal. {{TEAM}} have lost their top half and don't have much on the board. {{BATSMAN}} c Sarfaraz Khan b {{BOWLER}} 28(18) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Zaheer!! Is there a twist here? With mid-off inside the circle, it was worth taking the gamble. But, {{BATSMAN}} didn't get the desired result. The pace off the ball did the trick here. {{BATSMAN}} moved leg-side and mishit the lofted-off drive straight to mid-off. The bat turned at the point of impact. {{BATSMAN}} c Zaheer b {{BOWLER}} 7(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Y Pathan!! One-handed ripper from Yusuf! What's with IPL these days? Gayle picked up one yesterday and another big man does today. Huge wicket for SRH and {{BOWLER}} has picked this up with a nothing ball to be honest. Skidded through off a good length and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to go across the line. Got hurried into it and ended up spooning it towards short third man where the big Pathan leapt, stretching his right hand. And it stuck folks, it stuck. Look at the joy on the SRH fielders' faces. Game on, then. {{BATSMAN}} c Y Pathan b {{BOWLER}} 39(30) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! And another one for the Slinga! Slower delivery cutting across, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat at it and skies it up. The keeper again calls for it and catches it near the point region. This is extremely poor from {{TEAM}}. Throwing it away at the end of it. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Third batsman out in the 20s. {{BOWLER}} has a wicket and has his finger up in delight. Wicket-to-wicket stuff from Watto, {{BATSMAN}} made room to glide it behind point, was beaten for pace and the ball kissed the off-pole. Crucial wicket for the home side as {{BATSMAN}} was looking to get on with proceedings. The off-cutter that skidded off the surface. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 21(25) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Gonzo! Terrible misjudgement from {{BATSMAN}} and he pays the price. Made room to a slider from {{BOWLER}}, ended up getting too close for comfort as it zips through and crashes his front pad first. The appeal was spontaneous and only question there was whether it was pad first as {{BATSMAN}} did make contact with the bat later. Umpire Nitin Menon was sure about it and raised his finger. {{BATSMAN}} also knew it and started walking. HawkEye says that it's smashing the off-stump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 18(20) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pollard!! The wheels falling off here. Looks for his favoured flat batted pull through cow corner. Does get it right but neither manages the elevation nor does he keep it down. Yet another batsman picks out Pollard at the fence. The ploy of keeping it short and slow doing the trick out here. {{BATSMAN}} c Pollard b {{BOWLER}} 9(8)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sam Curran!! Such a soft dismissal as {{BATSMAN}} just chips this into the hands of mid-off. Half-hearted loft, never went through with it and to make it worse the timing isn't there at all. Bounces off the toe-end and it's a dolly for Curran. The {{TEAM}} captain gone early. {{BATSMAN}} c Sam Curran b {{BOWLER}} 12(10) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Dead straight. Just that it goes onto the pad after smashing the bat. A yorker on the stumps, quite where he should have been right from the start. {{BATSMAN}} tries hard in getting his bat down in digging it out. Almost does well in the end, gets right off the toe-end to ricochet onto his boot. Too quick for the umpire to spot it as well. Never mind. {{TEAM}} finish with 178. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Riyan Parag!! What was the hurry? First ball from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} wants to take him on. Charged down the track, decided to launch it in the 'V' but gets it off the bottom part of the bat. Skies it up in the air and Parag from mid-on calls for it, keeps his eyes on the ball and cups it safely. RR have their first wicket, can they nip out a few more? {{BATSMAN}} c Riyan Parag b {{BOWLER}} 16(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} has been adjudged lbw and he has decided to challenge the umpire's call. This probably is hitting the leg-stump, hence the batsman will have to walk back to the pavilion. Three reds and another wicket goes down. {{BATSMAN}} was trying to play a cheeky scoop shot, gets struck on the pads instead. Pitching in line, impact on leg and hitting the leg stump. Dead. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by D Kulkarni!! Yea, you can't let your state-mate have a moral internal laugh, even if it's only for a ball, can you? Well, {{BATSMAN}} surely can't let him do. He clears out his front leg, looks to go lofted over mid-off, but in his desperation gets a little too much wood under the ball. Hence - great elevation, but distance = a damn alert long-off. Kulkarni, judges it perfectly, going right to the edge of the rope, and then balances himself superbly as well to ensure his over-head attempt doesn't take him over. {{BATSMAN}} c D Kulkarni b {{BOWLER}} 22(24) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Wicket off the first ball of the over and {{BATSMAN}} has to take the long walk back. Shortish ball from NCN, {{BATSMAN}} comes forward and looks to go downtown. Ends up slicing it miles up in the air. Yadav, at long-on takes it calmly. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 22(17) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Warner!! It was an experiment from Warner and it has paid off. Completes the catch, turns towards the crowd and does a fist pump. {{TEAM}} have lost two in quick succession. Both set batsmen gone. Slows it up as {{BATSMAN}} gives the charge, he goes through with the loft even though he isn't to pitch of the ball, miscues it towards long-off and Warner ain't dropping those. {{BATSMAN}} c Warner b {{BOWLER}} 32(21) [4s-2 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! There you go! Yuvi's vulnerability against off spin has come under scanner, once again. It was fired flatter and into the batsman from round the wicket, Yuvi smacks it high into the night sky. More elevation than distance. Long-on gobbles it up with ease. {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 15(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! The lovely drift of {{BOWLER}} has accounted for yet another young Indian batsman. He came from round the wicket, got this one to slide one with the angle, {{BATSMAN}} was playing down the wrong line, ended up pushing his bat outside the line of the delivery, gets beaten on ths inside edge and is rapped right in front. The impact was in front of middle-stump, at worst, would have been crashing into leg. Easy call for the umpire and DD continue to slump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 3(6)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Miller!! One shot too many? But, that's how {{BATSMAN}} plays. A seam-up back of a length delivery at 144.3kph, {{BATSMAN}} goes for another straight-pull from the crease. Went too hard and in the process lost his shape. The ball ballooned up off the top-edge. It went up a long way and Miller called for it. The South African settled under it by moving to his right from extra cover and completed a very good catch. KXIP have the breakthrough! {{BATSMAN}} c Miller b {{BOWLER}} 10(10) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Big, big appeal from the keeper more so than anyone else. Given. Now then, {{BATSMAN}} deliberates with his partner for a reasonable amount of time, before taking the review. Did the ball straighten enough, or was it sliding down? It's clipping leg-stump according to ball-tracking. So the umpire's call will stay. What a precious spell this has been from {{BOWLER}}, standing out amid the carnage to remove both the opening batsmen. {{BATSMAN}} was quickly down on his knees to sweep this hard, but failed to connect. It didn't grip the pitch much after drifting in, but gripped just enough to be clipping the stump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 53(32) [4s-7 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Yeah, that's how you halt rampagers -- with drift. {{BOWLER}} starts wide of his crease, entices {{BATSMAN}} to go sweeping with the angle. But he gets a little too greedy, shuffling way across, sweeping, and getting fully foxed by the dip, which sneaks under the bat, kisses the glove and is still quick enough to uproot leg. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(8) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Henriques!! Straight up off a leading edge, taken! SRH taking control. There's no turn on the ball as {{BOWLER}} fires it on leg-stump from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} swings across the line and is undone by the sliding delivery. Good catch from Henriques too. He pedalled backwards from mid-wicket and made it much easier than it should have been. {{BATSMAN}} c Henriques b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Nadeem!! Holes out before the final finish as well. That's the end with the bat for {{BATSMAN}} this season. After a favour of a full toss from Zak, he decides to return the favour. Another slower one on the driving length and the lofted drive through the off-side has the bat turning in his palms as he balloons it to long-off. {{BATSMAN}} is angry, no he is furious. Takes out the anger on himself slapping his legs with his bat. {{BATSMAN}} c Nadeem b {{BOWLER}} 58(45) [4s-3 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karthik!! The pace has the last laugh. Disconcerting bounce coupled with it forces an almost evasive action from {{BATSMAN}}, who fails to get his gloves out of the way. The ball flicked the gloves and went up for the keeper to take it with ease. The Eden is alive and noisy. Eden has witnessed many collapses and this one is dear to KKR. {{BATSMAN}} c Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 3(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kohli!! All the timing. All the power. All the elegance. Just that there is a certain Kohli in the way. Clears his front leg, gets his eyeline right on the ball and looks to go for the inside-out slap through the covers. Intercepted and a dive to his left plucks this one out of thin air. Diving low as well in the process. A real stunner. {{BATSMAN}} c Kohli b {{BOWLER}} 31(23) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tahir!! Watto strikes! Removes his former RCB teammate. It was banged short by the Australian and the line was on leg. {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull half-heartedly as he was slightly cramped form room and all he could manage was a top-edge that lobs straight to short fine leg. A dolly for Tahir. {{BOWLER}} has his arms aloft. End of a superb knock from 'Universe Boss'. {{BATSMAN}} c Tahir b {{BOWLER}} 63(33) [4s-7 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Cleaned up! {{BATSMAN}}'s struggles continue.. Apart from one innings, he has looked woefully out of form. Fuller than a good length and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to steer it to third man, too close to him and the off-stump is pegged back. {{TEAM}} once again lose a wicket in the powerplay. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 7(11) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! Body blow by {{BOWLER}}! Cracking delivery and {{BATSMAN}} has been sent back early. Was angling across from a good length around off, held its line after pitching and bounced just a bit more than {{BATSMAN}} anticipated it to. He was looking to force it through the off-side and got cramped, thereby getting an inside edge through to de Kock who took it with ease. Just the kind of start MI were looking for. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 8(9) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by de Kock!! And the twist comes from a stress-fractured off-cutter. They've realized there's no point in bowling your best ball, and {{BOWLER}} smartly floats up a slower change up. {{BATSMAN}} can't wait, he commits to a lofted slice, loses timing, has the ball grab the upper half of his bat and fly. Fly higher. Over Quinton, who's already messed up a few. He runs behind, under the swirl, comes back and collects. {{BATSMAN}} c de Kock b {{BOWLER}} 65(42) [4s-6 6s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Surrenders in the quest fo an extra run. But he's done his job. Squeezes out a fullish one, almost whipping it in the process to long-on. A charge in and a good throw at the keeper's end ensures that {{BATSMAN}}'s desperate diving attempt to get back in for the second is futile. So, 161 is what Pune manage. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Kohli/Kedar Jadhav) 27(11) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, leg byes, 1 run, Mumbai Indians review against {{BATSMAN}}! Rohit took his time, had a discussion with his team mates and signals for the review with just a second to go. Looks a bad call though. {{BATSMAN}} was way outside his crease when the ball struck him and the replays confirm the ball to be missing the stumps by a fair margin. He was trying to flick across the line but got beaten as the ball struck him on the pads. Impact was umpire's call and it was going over the stumps\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Gone this time! Faf du Plessis was asking him to opt for the review, but {{BATSMAN}} thinks otherwise and decides to walk back. This one shaped into the batsman on a fullish length and beat {{BATSMAN}}'s across-the-line flick. Struck in front of middle, but looking at the replays, I think it might have clipped or probably missed the leg stump. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 1(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Shake of the head from {{BOWLER}}. Why did he bowl the leggie to the tailender and not target the sticks with a googly like this one, says {{BOWLER}} to himself. {{BATSMAN}} lofts over the top, or he wanted to, misses and sneaks through the gate. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 6(7) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Mohit Sharma!! Sliced up off a thick edge, Mohit Sharma gets underneath it comfortably at cover. So {{BATSMAN}}'s joyride comes to an end. The carrom ball was cleverly fired out of his arc, and his leg-side swipe was always vulnerable to the ball turning away. He's done his job though. He's done more than what could've been asked of him. {{BATSMAN}} c Mohit Sharma b {{BOWLER}} 39(20) [4s-1 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! Pick. Heave. And perfectly picking out the fielder. {{BOWLER}} Sharma - hidden all this while for some strange reason - comes, keeps hitting his trademark back of a length on the tummy. {{BATSMAN}} tries making some room to this and swipes it in quite an agricultural hack. Can't keep it down. Can't get the distance on it either. Bang. Deep square leg. {{BATSMAN}} c Prithvi Shaw b {{BOWLER}} 10(13)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Vijay Shankar!! Poor IPL for {{BATSMAN}} continues. He has been in filthy form this season. It was a full toss, {{BATSMAN}} mistimes the heave and he has been caught at deep mid-wicket. He is going nowhere and is standing in his crease even after the catch is taken. He thinks it's a no-ball for being above the waist. The umpires have gone upstairs to check for the no-ball. The replay however shows it is below the waist height and {{BATSMAN}} will have to depart. {{BATSMAN}} c Vijay Shankar b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! The plan has worked. The plan to bowl short and slow to these two. Once again {{BATSMAN}} fails to get the timing right. Backs away a touch to slap past cover. That's actually not a bad shot, but ends up hitting it straight to the fielder at extra cover. So straight that the man there did not have to move an inch. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 32(30) [4s-2 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Shardul {{BOWLER}} has been terrific with his lengths and variations today. Bowls the cross-seam delivery and pitches it much shorter than it did against Gill. A similar dismissal though. {{BATSMAN}} looks to go over mid-wicket with a cross-bat swipe and sends a crisp edge through to the keeper. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Axar!! Well, well. This is getting rather tame. {{BOWLER}} loops it up and gets it fuller, {{BATSMAN}} - poor old {{BATSMAN}} - was only looking to push it away defensively to leg, but he's early, ending up with yet-another leading edge straight to short cover, who's there just for stuff like this. {{BATSMAN}} c Axar b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hardik Pandya!! {{BATSMAN}} was iffy with his running right from the start, rode his luck but finally perishes now. Fullish on off, {{BATSMAN}} backed away aiming to go inside-out over extra cover. Doesn't get the timing right and ends up hitting it towards Harik at long-off, who had to run to his left and gobbles it up. Made that look so easy, didn't he? Punjab continue to lose wickets in clusters. {{BATSMAN}} c Hardik Pandya b {{BOWLER}} 23(12) [4s-1 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The {{BOWLER}} special, {{BATSMAN}} can't do much, just drops his head and walks off. Goes a touch wide of the crease and lands a perfect yorker, right at the base of middle stump. By the time {{BATSMAN}} got his bat down, his stumps were already shattered. Phewf! {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 20(10) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! What a rippah! {{BOWLER}} shows who's the boss here. Imparts loads of revs on this and gets the ball to straighten at a rapid pace to bamboozle the 18-year old. {{BATSMAN}} clearly didn't pick that. Was standing languidly on the back foot hoping to milk that across the line, wasn't to be. Pegs are back... {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 2(4)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Christian!! {{BATSMAN}} had to go for it, but he shouldn't have hit it straight down the ground. Kohli is fuming under that helmet, but he doesn't reveal anything. He's standing there helpless. Expectedly, with a left-hander on strike and {{BATSMAN}} known for his big-hits, {{BOWLER}} bowls the googly that is well outside off stump, the batsman would have ideally wanted to hit that over cover, but he hit it very straight and offered a simple catch to long-off. {{BATSMAN}} c Christian b {{BOWLER}} 3(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Got him and {{BOWLER}} has two in five balls. What a sweet revenge for the former {{TEAM}} skipper. Tosses this around middle and leg and gets it to rip sharply off the surface, {{BATSMAN}} was leaning forward but wasn't ready to counter the extra bounce as it kisses the pad before hitting the top of off. Left-handers against off-spin will always be a challenge and wasn't long ago we witnessed CSK send a left-hander against left-arm spin. Tactics, strategies...ah! What do the data analysts know? {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Gamble to give {{BOWLER}} the ball has worked for DK. {{BATSMAN}} was trying a little to hard, he was looking to smash everything. But was not able to time most of the shots. This one was a slider on a good length, it skids off the deck. {{BATSMAN}} was late on the hoick. It misses his balde and raps him on the pads. Plumb infront! {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 25(24) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Smith!! That's a soft dismissal, reckons KP on air. Was a wide ball outside off and {{BATSMAN}} threw his hands at it. Miscues it towards cover-point as Smith takes an easy catch. If not with the bat, he'll do it with the ball. {{BOWLER}}, you beauty! Half of Delhi side back in the hut with more than 6 overs to go. {{BATSMAN}} c Smith b {{BOWLER}} 39(30) [6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul Tewatia!! {{BOWLER}} strikes! For a moment Tewatia had misjudged this in the deep but does really well to keep his eyes on the ball and take it just when it's about to dip in front of him. {{BATSMAN}} was down on his knee as he picked up the length delivery towards the deep square leg fence. Got the elevation but not the distance he was looking for. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul Tewatia b {{BOWLER}} 14(13) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! {{BATSMAN}} is gone! Excellent catch by Pant. {{BATSMAN}} moves leg-side and {{BOWLER}} follows him with a sharp bouncer. He isn't in the greatest of positions, but still persists with his pull shot and gets a top edge. The ball lobs up very high. The keeper runs back and calls for it. Nadeem was also approaching towards him from short fine leg. The ball swirls around as it drops down. Pant holds his nerve and dives full-stretched and gobbles it cleanly. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 27(19) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Stokes!! Another skier, another good take. The fielder at long-on came in running in and took it. The length ball was another swirler. The ball sliced up from the outer half of the blade and the fielder did the rest. {{BATSMAN}} c Stokes b {{BOWLER}} 3(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Rahul!! {{BOWLER}} gets the second wicket too. Bowls a short delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} tries to pull that away but ends up getting a top edge. Easy take for Rahul to hold on. It's Andre Russell who walks out to bat at {{BATSMAN}}'s fall. Was such an entertaining knock by the all-rounder. Has left the Kings stunned and speechless. {{BATSMAN}} c Rahul b {{BOWLER}} 75(36) [4s-9 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! What a soft dismissal! For all the shots he's played so far, {{BATSMAN}} departs in tame fashion. It's been the story of his IPL career by and large. Gets attractive starts but perishes after the Powerplay. This was a cleverly bowled off cutter from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} wanted to go aerial through his favorite region square through the off-side. Misread the pace and ended up chipping it straight to Yadav at backward point. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 28(20) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Wow. Wow. This is exceptional finish from Krishna and KKR. 4 wickets and just 4 runs in the over. Take a bow, Krishna. Ushered it short and gets it to rise over Kumar's attempted hoick. Fails to connect and they try to sneak in a bye. But DK hits the bulls-eye and catches the batsman well short of his crease. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Karthik) 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! Fuller and flatter, {{BATSMAN}} missed the clip for the ball to thud his front pad. Bruce Oxenford had his finger up and {{BATSMAN}} after some deliberation with his partner decided to review. But that was in vain as it was three reds. SRH are still breathing.. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 14(13) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BATSMAN}} is dejected. Cannot believe his luck. Was there some edge? It definitely hit him high on leg there. But he was on the back foot having missed this skidder from {{BOWLER}}, who pumps his fist as soon as the umpire acknowledges the lbw appeal. What a wicket. Was there a time-out before this ball? Never mind. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 38(32) [4s-4 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! {{BOWLER}} has deceived {{BATSMAN}} completely in the air. Anticipated that {{BATSMAN}} was getting itchy and was looking to dominate him, shortened his length and beats {{BATSMAN}} in the air, the extra bounce did the trick. {{BATSMAN}} was completely flummoxed on the lofted drive and Pant is quick to whip the bails off. {{TEAM}} are in a spot of bother now. {{BATSMAN}} st Pant b {{BOWLER}} 24(24) [4s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Gambhir Run Out!! Brilliance from Mujeeb! Direct hits are always dangerous and it's proven this time. Slower ball on leg, {{BOWLER}} got away with this delivery as fine leg was up in the ring. Mujeeb was quick to attack the ball and threw down the stumps at the keeper's end in a flash. Initially seemed like Gambhir made it but he was just short. These direct hits I tell you. This Afghan lad is a champion, isn't he? What a debut! Gambhir run out (Mujeeb) 55(42) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! 1 run completed. Wide yorker. Squeezed away to deep point. But suddenly, for some weird reason {{BATSMAN}} then doesn't want the second. Yes. No. Yes. No. And the half-hearted yes without proper consent ends up with him falling short, clearly short. The throw's f;at, which Quinton collects from well behind the stumps and under-arms it onto the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Krunal Pandya/de Kock) 80(59) [4s-8 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by S Kaul!! {{BOWLER}} has got his man! He slowed down the pace, the length made {{BATSMAN}} come down the track, there was no pace on the ball. {{BATSMAN}} had to manufacture all the power behind the shot, he was playing against the wind, ends up chipping a dolly - down to the throat of mid-on. Kaul ran across to his right and accepted the offering. {{BATSMAN}} c S Kaul b {{BOWLER}} 2(7)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Karn Sharma!! That's the second duck of this innings. First it was Bhui and now it's {{BATSMAN}}. Was a full length delivery outside off and swinging away from the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} went ahead with his shot and ended up slicing it to the man at third man. Surprising to see that it carried all the way to third man. Probably there was a bit of extra bounce on that. {{BATSMAN}} c Karn Sharma b {{BOWLER}} 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Boult!! Plays against the spin and perishes. Looks to go over long-on/mid-wicket with a wild swing and ends up slicing a dolly of a catch to backward point. Half the side back in the hut now. {{BATSMAN}} c Boult b {{BOWLER}} 18(18) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Raina!! Catching practice for Raina at extra cover. {{BOWLER}} breaks into a jig and CSK on top now. Two wickets in three balls and {{TEAM}} are in trouble. It was fuller and just outside off, seemed to have stopped on the wicket a tad and {{BATSMAN}} checks his shot early and airly to Raina, who makes no mistake. Could this be the game-changing over? {{BATSMAN}} c Raina b {{BOWLER}} 2(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Suryakumar Yadav!! Gone! How many times have we witnessed that? Wicket right after the break. Big one for Mumbai as {{BATSMAN}} looked in his elements today. Slowed up and got a bit of purchase as well, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the slog sweep, the ball turns away with some bounce, the top-edge balloons towards deep mid-wicket, where SKY takes a sitter. {{BATSMAN}} c Suryakumar Yadav b {{BOWLER}} 37(21) [4s-6 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Eoin Morgan!! Catching practice for Morgan. Another partnership that had started to flourish is nipped in the bud. Not the greatest of shots from {{BATSMAN}}. It was a length delivery alright and he wanted to loft it over the long-on fence, the bat turned on impact and the ball went up towards long-on. Second catch for the England ODI skipper. {{BATSMAN}} c Eoin Morgan b {{BOWLER}} 22(17) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Sachin Baby!! This was coming. It really was. Tactical aggression here from SD with his dance down the track looking to smoke some into the clouds. Does everything in getting right to the pitch of this fuller one as well, swings mighty too, just that he skews it off the toe end. All the altitude and into the safe palms of Baby at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Sachin Baby b {{BOWLER}} 40(31) [4s-5]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Siraj!! .. and he strikes first ball. It's the big wicket of {{BATSMAN}}, dropped short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes lit up as he saw the width, went way too hard on the cut, lost his poise and the thick top-edge lobbed gently to Siraj at short third man. Relief for RCB, but still need 7 wickets to pinch this match. {{BATSMAN}} c Siraj b {{BOWLER}} 32(25) [4s-3 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! {{BOWLER}} is running through {{TEAM}} single-han{{BATSMAN}}dly - the dangerous AB falls and the Banglaore franchise are in a mess. Lovely loopy {{BATSMAN}}livery on off, dragged AB forward as he looked to go insi{{BATSMAN}} out over cover, the ball drifted away and then dipped past the outsi{{BATSMAN}} edge - clatters into the stumps and that's the end of AB - End of {{TEAM}}? Think so. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 1(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Andrew Tye Run Out!! A real waste of a wicket, but that's unfortunate. Nothing much {{BATSMAN}} can do about it. A dipping full toss which {{BATSMAN}} hits straight back to {{BOWLER}} who collects in his followthrough to run Tye out, can't back up that far. Andrew Tye run out ({{BOWLER}}) 25(12) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Buttler!! RR are pegging back {{TEAM}} here. {{BATSMAN}} has looked out of sorts since a last couple of overs and finally, he decides to throw his wicket away to {{BOWLER}}. Again the off-cutter, slanted around off. {{BATSMAN}} in a bid to step up the pedal, miscues it totally. Top-edges it into the night sky, was swirling in the air. Buttler called for it, moved across to his left and safely grabbed it. {{BATSMAN}} c Buttler b {{BOWLER}} 72(47) [4s-6 6s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Miller!! Carrom ball and Faf is gone. Second wicket for the skipper. He spotted Faf clearing that front leg and kept the carrom ball close to him, the South African could not get underneath it and hence the mistime, Miller claims it comfortably near the long-on fence. The crowd erupts at Chepauk and that is because Thala Dhoni has walked out. {{BATSMAN}} c Miller b {{BOWLER}} 54(38) [4s-2 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Stumped!! Brilliant from DK but felt that {{BATSMAN}} gave up all too easily. Could've put pressure on DK by attempting to dive, none of that and he goes. Was down the track looking to flick, richocheted off the pad and went in front of DK who calmly collects the ball and then backflicks to hit direct. One glove was off quickly and that made it easier for DK. Can't understand why it has been changed to stumped. According to the laws of the game, when a batsman is attempting a run - {{BATSMAN}} surely was - it should be declared run-out. Weird! {{BATSMAN}} st Karthik b {{BOWLER}} 36(19) [4s-5 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Hetmyer!! None of the lucky ground nonsense here. {{BATSMAN}} wants to smoke it over long-on, and given his tryst with Sharjah, doesn't even look like keeping it down. Alas, it's a miscue, and there's only height on this without distance. Ends up at deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} c Hetmyer b {{BOWLER}} 5(9)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Miller!! That was a wide.. had {{BATSMAN}} left it. But he doesn't. Goes after the slower ball, slices it up in the air, and Miller comes in a few yards from long-off to catch it. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Miller b {{BOWLER}} 11(4) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Shaun Marsh!! Another chance for Marsh and this time he holds on, DD's procession continues. On a good length and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was leaning forward on the lofted drive, the bat turned as he made contact, ends up mistiming it high and towards long-on. Marsh has a long time to settle under it and gobbles it up, fourth wicket for {{BOWLER}} and he's having quite an evening. {{BATSMAN}} c Shaun Marsh b {{BOWLER}} 11(20) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Dhoni!! Dhoni catches and {{BATSMAN}} has to walk back to the dressing room. That's not something we are used to. A shortish ball, slightly off-paced and {{BATSMAN}} was back and across to pull it away. Top-edges and MS runs towards the square leg region to snaffle that. {{BATSMAN}} c Dhoni b {{BOWLER}} 14(11) [6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out McClenaghan Run Out!! 1 run completed. McClenaghan sacrifices his wicket trying to get {{BATSMAN}} back on strike. Was struck down the ground over the bowler's head as another wide yorker was executed. The man at long-off zoomed the throw to the bowler's end for the bowler to whip the bails off. {{BOWLER}} shows emotions as well and bangs the ball on to the turf after whipping the bails off. McClenaghan run out (du Plessis/{{BOWLER}}) 0(2)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Prithvi Shaw!! The teenager takes a high-pressure catch. The cross-seamed fuller length ball, {{BATSMAN}} went too hard on his lofted shot and lost all his shape in the process. Wanted to go downtown and the bat face turned at the point of impact. Went miles up in the air and Shaw settled under it after running back from extra cover. Reverse-cupped. {{BATSMAN}} c Prithvi Shaw b {{BOWLER}} 21(17) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by (sub)Shorey!! One, two, three and taken in the end. The substitute fielder takes a juggling catch. Rajasthan lose their third wicket. Hint of away-spin, and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get the timing right on his one-legged sweep. It was on the leg-stump line and hence {{BATSMAN}} went for that shot. Shorey ran in from deep square leg and almost made a mess of it. It brushed the cap and made contact with his right arm too. In the end, he pouched that. {{BATSMAN}} c (sub)Shorey b {{BOWLER}} 6(6) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Pant!! {{BATSMAN}} has been dismissed, finally. So, the couple of dropped chances haven't cost much. This pitched outside off and spun away sharply from the batsman who tried to flirt with it and got an outside edge. Sharp reflexes by Pant as he takes it. Both {{TEAM}} openers are back to the pavilion as the Delhi spinners are choking their opposition at the moment. {{BATSMAN}} c Pant b {{BOWLER}} 13(14) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by du Plessis!! Trap set, trap sprung. {{BATSMAN}} couldn't have placed it any better and Faf takes a smart catch at long-off. Floated up by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} creates room seeking for the insi{{BATSMAN}}-out loft and ends up lofting it towards du Plessis at long-off who moved to his right and gobbled it up. The fiel{{BATSMAN}}r was a bit wi{{BATSMAN}}r and {{BATSMAN}} inten{{BATSMAN}}d it to go more squarer there. Unfortunately, picked out the fiel{{BATSMAN}}r. Both openers back in the hut for {{TEAM}}. CSK fans find their voice back. {{BATSMAN}} c du Plessis b {{BOWLER}} 8(12) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw! Doesn't even wait to review! Angles it across after pitching in on leg and middle, straightens, does the leg-spinner, and {{BATSMAN}} is trapped on the backfoot, trying to tuck across the line - but the whippy action and the lack of backspin means that it will hurry on and he is trapped in front. He's on his way back after an impressive cameo up top. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 20(10) [4s-3 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Has Jadeja got {{BATSMAN}} with a direct hit? I feel he has. Yes, OUT in RED. Dabbed the ball away into the off-side and looked for a single. Jadeja came in from point and had a shy at the bowler's end. The bullseye was hit. And GL have another lifeline. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Jadeja) 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tripathi!! Wow! Is that the game? {{BOWLER}} certainly thinks so. Pumps his fist in excitement. The off-cutter on a shortish length. They have been bowling that all evening. {{BATSMAN}} goes for the cut and like Warner does not have the power to get it over the man sweeping. Tripathi runs to his right and takes a well-judged catch. {{BATSMAN}} has some advice for the incoming Bipul Sharma. {{BATSMAN}} c Tripathi b {{BOWLER}} 47(43) [4s-4 6s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Raina Run Out!! Direct hit and the skipper has to walk back. {{BOWLER}} bowls one in the blockhole just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} squirts it out to backward point. Raina wanted a quick single and is halfway down. That's when he saw his partner who wasn't interested in the run. Rabada finds the target direct and Raina is well short. The 133-run partnership has been broken. Raina run out (Rabada) 77(43) [4s-5 6s-4]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ravi Bishnoi!! Bangalore pressing the self destruct button now. This shot from {{BATSMAN}} reminds me of his dismissal in the 2015 WC semis. A left-armer digging it short and getting the better of him thanks to an ungainly top-edge. This was caught easily at mid-on. That was short and angled across after a couple of fuller deliveries. Nicely set up by the bowler. He bent his back on this delivery and got his reward. {{BATSMAN}} c Ravi Bishnoi b {{BOWLER}} 1(5)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Ashwin!! That's a fantastic catch by Ashwin. Takes a well judged catch at mid-wicket running to his left. Even Gayle was circling around but it's the skipper who takes it eventually. Just as we were praising {{BATSMAN}} for playing another gem of a knock he's thrown it away. Got outfoxed due to the slower delivery as he swung across the line and got a top-edge on his drag. He has done his job though. Should be a walk in the park for Delhi unless they face another dramatic batting collapse. {{BATSMAN}} c Ashwin b {{BOWLER}} 56(41) [4s-7 6s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Tom Curran!! {{BOWLER}}'s not only gotten away with a short ball, he's got a wicket for it. {{BATSMAN}} toe-ends his pull straight to deep square leg. Took his time, made a run-a-ball 21 and now departs. This will hurt {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} c Tom Curran b {{BOWLER}} 21(21) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Clear nick, no appeal from the bowler, even the keeper didn't hear the edge, but {{BATSMAN}} walks. Well done sir! It's been short of length from {{BOWLER}} all over, this time he bowls it slightly wide outside off stump than the previous ones, {{BATSMAN}} throws his hands at it to cut it away for four but gets a faint edge. Not sure if the umpire heard that nick too. Would have been interesting if {{BATSMAN}} had not walked. Just the start {{TEAM}} didn't want in a crunch game. {{BATSMAN}} c Kedar Jadhav b {{BOWLER}} 1(3)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Y Pathan!! The extra ball gets {{BOWLER}} a wicket. This was a slower knuckle ball, {{BATSMAN}} had to go for runs, looks to tonk it over long-on, doesn't get anywhere near the middle of the bat and it's a simple catch for Yusuf - right in front of the ropes at long-on. {{BATSMAN}} c Y Pathan b {{BOWLER}} 18(18) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! The middle stump goes for a toss. {{BOWLER}} does it again. A cross-seam delivery on middle, which {{BATSMAN}} missed. Pretty ordinary as he was looking to turn it to leg, closed the bat face too early and saw his middle stump flattened. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 5(5) [4s-1]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! That is plumb in front! Impact right in front of off stump. You can't be slogging with a pull shot when it's not really short. Hit around the kneeroll. {{BATSMAN}} seemed to be rushed by that length delivery and DC have a breakthrough! Okay, was a slower delivery, so he was trying to adjust and that's why he missed. So far, a top over from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 26(21) [4s-3]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Lbw!! {{BOWLER}} strikes and RCB are fighting back into the contest. This was the straighter one from the leg-break bowler, pitched on leg and slid through, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to work it towards the on-side, ended up playing right across the line and missed, would have been going on and hitting a good chunk of middle and leg stump. The umpire takes his time and lifts the dreaded finger. {{BATSMAN}} lbw b {{BOWLER}} 11(9) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Bowled!! Backs away, creates room and misses the fullish ball for DC to complete the formalities. From 101 for 2 to 116 bowled out. DC jump to second in the points table. {{BATSMAN}} b {{BOWLER}} 0(1)\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out {{BATSMAN}} Run Out!! Excellent awareness from Bairstow. He even fooled Warner at slip, who gestured that it was not out. {{BATSMAN}} pats it towards cover and sets off, Pollard doesn't move and the young man has to turn back, run and puts in the dive as well. By this time, Bairstow had disturbed the stumps with his pad before the throw came but he ensured he uprooted one of the stumps with the ball in his hand. {{BATSMAN}}'s dive meant the bat popped up and he was caught short of the crease. If the stumps were not uprooted, {{BATSMAN}} would have survived this. {{BATSMAN}} run out (Shankar/Bairstow) 17(21) [4s-2]\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, out Caught by Watson!! {{BATSMAN}} departs after getting to his fifty. That has been the problem with him this season. Not able to carry on and get a big score. Makes room and slaps the short ball straight to Watson at who was stationed close to the ring at covers. Time for Moeen to walk in next. {{BATSMAN}} c Watson b {{BOWLER}} 53(37) [4s-2 6s-4]\n"

It didn't quite go out of his hands. It's been so good for him that we've looked at the replay [on Monday night] and he's taken his time and looked to get a full slice. That was on a normal match, when a good effort like this doesn't go on in a big way. The extra weight was a lot of pressure in this match. It's a long one for the visitors. One of the other players that is in his game has to take the extra push to get into a good position. The keeper can't catch that and the rest will follow. He went for it a long time, he didn't really have a clear line of sight, he was looking to drive straight at it and to not look in the wrong place to do so in this situation is a problem. So, he tries to get that, it did have to have an extra edge that he didn't get. He didn't get the ball in the spot so it was just a matter of keeping it straight and putting it back as though it was on the surface. But as soon as it was there, it's gone and it doesn't touch the ground. The balls are in front of the striker. He goes through the smoke-stomach and doesn't go back to the line. And at that point, the striker looks to hit the top of the keeper's pads and gets the keeper to throw him across the line at that point and give the other side a chance to score,\" said Nair.\n",

Kolkata is looking to put an end to this. They went in from the wrong part, he didn't move the ball from the forward side - the skipper did - had the right and the wrong pitch to flick. And they are on the verge of hitting the right length to keep the ball away from the keeper, and the umpire doesn't take the time to pick the wrong angle. That kind of review has been going on for quite some time. What the team can do now is run out of patience and turn it into a slog for the skipper. The umpires had a point on that and he knew he had to pull out the middle, and that made it a tough one for him, who in his opinion has made a good effort. The umpire will be looking for reasons to have this match review done by a different umpire. So, what did he think, and how did he react? Was this done to his face on the off-side, or was he trying to keep calm as he tried to push it on the edge of the pitch?\n",
            "In his first match of the season against the Delhi side, against Manoj Yadav who has gone through a tough run in his early years, this was a tough slog. The umpire was in the middle of the pitch, trying to pick his right and went on his back foot. He didn't really have to follow the ball, didn't move it as well as he wanted and just threw him in the air at length. It didn't go straight forward into the fielder's chest and the full height of the ball came through the bowler's gloves. It's a tough slog for any man to go through. This was a simple decision made by Kolkata. It was the most comfortable. And so, they lose that appeal. They won that early go-round and that will go into the Indian skipper's hands. His team-mate, Rohit Sharma, had just taken a few wickets for Delhi in Mumbai and was looking to go back to his old self as it is, he's seen enough of Rohit to know when to do it. His batsman, Rahul Bhatt and the stumps of Rohit Sharma to try and drive it past the batsman and it went through the wicket. Oh look, the stumps are looking good, Rohit wants to bat it straight up and it's in the air at first. That was the length and that ends up with him just hitting the back leg and slogging at the ground with his pads. But his team-mates, who are the wicketkeepers, went in to review it, which was a long slog and he had to take the ball away early in the slog. Rohit was on point. He had to cover the distance, so the ball\n"
