            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, much better from {{BATSMAN}}, length delivery from Shardul, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, opens up his arms and lofts it high and into the sight-screen. DD are off and running once again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is a length ball and it has disappeared. Drama. Two sixes in two balls from {{BATSMAN}}. He's striking it at 600. Swivels across and heaves it away over deep backward square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker but {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss. It was a full toss and {{BATSMAN}} uses his power to muscle it over deep mid-wicket, cleared the fence quite comfortably there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's the second 50-run stand of this match. {{TEAM}} showing some intent. This was slogged over the mid-wicket fence by {{BATSMAN}} to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dumped disdainfully over long-off. He's continuing from where he left off from the last game. {{BOWLER}} under the pump now. Flighted it more luringly, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and butchers it over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it is not Gayle but {{BATSMAN}} who will have a piece of {{BOWLER}}. The cheeky right hander, goes down to play that over-the-head-scoop, makes decent connect and the ball sails into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in his zone and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't have any second thoughts. Marmalizes it with utter disdain, Roy came in the way to interrupt, he was never going to catch that. Never\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's not working. {{BATSMAN}} is just too good for {{BOWLER}}. His slower balls do work sometimes but this is just different class. {{BATSMAN}} picks it up, waits on it and swipes it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} continues to march on. Wickets falling at one end won't make him a difference. This one is a short delivery on leg, {{BATSMAN}} keeps his calm and pulls it over fine leg, off his hips and over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, {{BATSMAN}} breaks the shackles, this was well tossed up on off, right into the swinging zone of {{BATSMAN}}, he gets forward and sends it high and into the second tier - over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} goes downtown and he's made good contact. {{BOWLER}} slightly overpitches and the right-hander takes heavy toll of it. Stays leg-side of the ball, stands tall and bludgeons it over long-off for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} and his front footed pulls. Ah, sublime. {{BOWLER}} looks to pepper it with banging it half way down and watches it being deposited with a flat bat into the first floor over deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full, on the sticks and Kaboom! That tailed in ever so faintly and {{BATSMAN}} goes into overdrive mode. That was tonked over deep mid-wicket as the whirlwind of the hands took it high and handsome over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, more of the juicy {{BOWLER}}ji half-trackers. More of the dispatches. This time it is off {{BATSMAN}}. Stays behind with the weight going backwards and a short arm jab in the air. Into his favoured cow corner region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fabulous shot. He has picked this googly alright, shimmies out, meets the pitch and lofts it inside-out over extra cover. Sweet timing and it sails over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's hit this all the way over long-on. Backs away and makes some room whilst doing so, meaning he could pump the ball away even though {{BOWLER}} was bringing it in wide of the crease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}, you beauty.. connects and connects this one properly. Moves across his stumps and pummels it over long-on. Too predictable from {{BOWLER}} and Virat throws his head in anger. Rohit jumps from his chair. Oh! What's happening!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this must be demoralising for {{BOWLER}}. Telegrams his intentions and shimmies out to meet the pitch, converts it into a full ball and blasts it over extra cover. Enough to carry it all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} decides to have some fun. {{BOWLER}} overdoes the flight here. Feeds it full and in the slot for {{BATSMAN}}, who flexes his arms and tonks it a long way into the long-on stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is in top gear! Tad short around off, the southpaw reaches out for it and thumps it right over long-on. Six more and Sunrisers have moved on to 92 after the first 10 overs, {{BATSMAN}} has scored 62 of them\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smoked! Probably has come a bit too late in the game I reckon. {{BATSMAN}} picked the slower ball this time and swung this merrily into the third tier at long-on. Mammoth blow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clears the fence! {{BATSMAN}} has looked really fidgety, trying to hit too hard and connects here. On a shortish length and he was across the stumps in a flash. Pumps it over deep square leg with a meaty strike\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} became a bit predictable there. Bowling offies on back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} waited back in the crease and then slotted the heave over wide long-on. Enough legs to carry over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's hit this all the way but it won't matter - full ball outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} lofts it to over long-off. KXIP have escaped home by 4 runs. Oh these {{TEAM}} games and run chases. They get so deep. You got to admire this man - MS {{BATSMAN}}. Injured very early in the innings, takes some treatment, takes it upon himself and almost takes his side home.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, two in two! Left-arm spin against {{BATSMAN}}? Not a good idea. He takes a step forward this time, wasn't quite to the pitch but he extends his long levers to butcher it into the deep mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's the kind of form, KL {{BATSMAN}} has been in. Stands tall and flicks the length delivery over deep mid-wicket for a towering six, his first one of the night\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bang! \"Don't ball short to me,\" seemed like the body language of {{BATSMAN}}. Knew what was coming, was ready on the back foot as he muscled it way back into the deep square leg stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finally, oh, finally, the wait is over. Here is the BIG SHOW!! The ball was in the zone and the batsman stayed his crease to use the long handle. The batsman again dragged the ball away and this time well over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now is helped by {{BOWLER}}. A full toss just below the waist, {{BATSMAN}} waits and swings it over long leg. Back to back sixes and with that it also brings up the fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. The chase depends on him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that should be it, this was tossed up well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and thumps it high towards long-on, didn't get hold of the shot, Kohli at long-off was kept interested, but in the end - the ball sailed over his head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, one-handed six. Full toss wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} throws the kitchen sink and slices it behind square on the off-side. The bottom hand comes off the handle as well. But, he's got enough wood to collect a six there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the KXIP skipper is welcomed with some rough treatment! {{BATSMAN}} shuffles around in the crease and slog sweeps this over fine leg for a maximum. No respite whatsoever from the Orange Army thus far\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, the slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, but it's too full and right under {{BATSMAN}}'s arc - he clears his left leg and drills it back over the umpire's head, has enough power to sail over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now downtown. {{BOWLER}} overcorrects going fuller, {{BATSMAN}} steps away, gives his hands room. And they swing, into the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} pumps it! Shimmies down the wicket and towers the flighted delivery right over the bowler's head for six more, straight as an arrow that was\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, too full. So when it is so full, {{BATSMAN}} can get under that. No chance for the ball doing anything off the pitch too. {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and laces the loft over long-off. Easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's high. That's handsome. On a length on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} stays put and towers this over long-on for six more. Rinku Singh at the fence was just a mere spectator. The crowd is loving this, when MS is in such form everybody does!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brilliant slog-sweep. Over deep mid. Too full and tossed up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} kneels down and finds the biggie that his side needs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and the free-hit is out of the park! The reply couldn't have been a better one. Length delivery by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} swings it over deep square leg for a monster hit. Once again, RCB are proving to be expensive in their death overs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed, the back of the hand slower short ball from {{BOWLER}}, but it sat up to be smacked. {{BATSMAN}} swivels across and pulls it high and way into the stands at long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! That's gone a long way. This match ain't over. Mumbai's season ain't over. Until {{BATSMAN}} is there. {{BOWLER}} is bowling length and {{BATSMAN}} is waiting for it, muscles the loft well over the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, round the wicket angle is not working, for now. Fraction short and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to pounce on it, he stays deep in the crease and smashes it a good 20 rows back\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, chips down the track and bang over covers for a sixer! Got to the pitch of the ball and then bulldozed it with all his sinews working in tandem. This guy! Phew!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, consecutive sixes for {{BATSMAN}}. He doesn't want {{BOWLER}} to dictate terms. Sees another flighted delivery just outside off, extends his long levers and lofts it over long-off. Clean as a whistle!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} puts his body-weight behind it and lofts that into the night sky, Maxwell at long-on tries to take that. Jumps sideways -- in an awkward enough shape already -- and ends up dropping it into the boundary. Think that was a six even if he had taken it; Maxwell was air-borne and well beyond the ropes. Unfortunate, because that was a good effort, but that's another six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a really good short ball from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} is unable to control the pull as he tries to fetch it over his head and nearly holes out. But these are short boundaries. The ball lobs up to the left of Binny at deep square leg, who runs backwards and leaps across but can only palm it over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over deep mid-wicket! Slower and a fraction short from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} sits on the back foot and went through with the pull shot. Didn't quite middle this as much as he would have wanted, still got it over McCullum who tried with all his might\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! Just a flick of the wrists from {{BATSMAN}} and away she goes. That's scintillating timing. It was a fullish off-cutter on middle stump and {{BATSMAN}} whipped it comfortably over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, much needed shackle-breaker for {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}}. {{BOWLER}} drags back the length and {{BATSMAN}} is all over it, quickly pouncing back in his crease and nailing the pull over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Ben {{BATSMAN}} is a no non-sense cricketer! Sits on one knee and smokes this floater flat over mid-wicket. Huge hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, glorious. Uses his feet and gets right to the pitch of the flighted delivery, once he did that the rest was easy, lofts it handsomely over the long-on fence for the first six of the game\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh he's connected this brilliantly! Give him a promotion next match! Slower delivery sat up nicely, {{BATSMAN}} hangs back and pulls powerfully over deep mid-wicket and easily clears the fence. Will this make Kohli smile?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over Pollard. Misses the yorker and bowls a juicy full toss, {{BATSMAN}} goes straight down the ground and gets enough wood on it to clear a leaping Pollard\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, much-needed six for the hosts. Yet another off-pace ball. {{BATSMAN}} saw that coming. Waits for this short ball to come to him and biffs the pull over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, tonked down the ground for a six. It's in that swinging arc, just outside off. {{BATSMAN}} arrests his back-lift and launches it over the bowler's head. For a moment, looked like he didn't get it off the middle but still he manages to get it over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a lovely hit! Hit on the rise, the bat made a good sound as it made contact with the ball. Slower delivery again and {{BATSMAN}} went straight towards the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hits back of a length and {{BATSMAN}} clubs it over long-on with ease! Set himself on the back foot and mauled it with full might\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh dear! {{BATSMAN}} is at it too. They are all at it. {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knees and slog sweeps India's fastest bowler for a maximum over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a flashback of {{BOWLER}} against {{BATSMAN}}. Remember that night in 2018? A tossed up delivery, touch short in length and it's been clubbed over deep mid-wicket by the opener, six runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the slower ball disappears now! He held his stroke back a bit, the ball chalked the toe-end of the bat and landed well over the cow-corner for a towering, welcoming six for MI\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, woah! {{BATSMAN}} is on fire. First ball from {{BOWLER}} and he launches him straight down the ground. This was right in the slot though but still had to be put away, Dhoni has a word with {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he is constantly feeding to {{BATSMAN}}'s strengths. That ball sat up nicely outside off, {{BATSMAN}} uses all his bottom hand power to hammer it straight of long-off. All the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, \"that's Colin {{BATSMAN}},\" goes Doully on air. He spots the googly, kneels down and slog sweeps it with the spin over cow corner. He's a big man and that ball sailed a long way into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautiful flick that. Very less margin for error on this wicket. Full on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} keeps his eyes on the ball and flicks it over mid-wicket with nonchalance. Made that shot look effortless\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he is greeted to the crease with a maximum. Slips in a googly, on a shortish length, {{BATSMAN}} picks it up and clubs it way back into the mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clubbed over deep mid-wicket. {{BATSMAN}} takes on {{BOWLER}}, gets underneath it and slams it powerfully over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} will play freely tonight, this was full and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} threw the kitchen sink at that, gets a thick outside edge that went high and over third man, first six of the night\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, same. {{BOWLER}} keeps flighting them up and {{BATSMAN}} keeps sending them into the stands. A clean swing of the bat and the ball sails over the long-off fence. Back-to-back sixes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, this is adding insult to injury - length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and lifts it high and over long-on - went sailing over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's huge! Outta here! On the pads, {{BATSMAN}} lifts the ball away and it soars away over deep square leg for a massive sixer\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slows the pace down, tossed up above the eye-line, the googly, {{BATSMAN}} spots it, hurries down the track to the pitch of it, and lofts it straight down the ground for a colossal six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, welcome, Mr. {{BOWLER}}. First ball and {{BATSMAN}} puts it into the last tier. Flighted on middle, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and swings it cleanly to send it sailing over long-on. Kohli enjoyed it at the other end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another slower delivery and has been thumped over deep mid. Got hold of the ball and muscled it over the boundary. Poor execution\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now a blistering strike over long-off. Wow. {{BOWLER}} had fired this pretty wide of off, so {{BATSMAN}} had to reach out slightly, but the timing is still so sublime\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 137kph, feeds a full toss in the arc at full pace. Well, well, it can't get easier. {{BATSMAN}} finds his arc, swinging and heaving over cow corner. This should break shackles\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's glorious from {{BATSMAN}}! Talk about being in ripe form, this is another example of it. Premeditates the charge down the pitch and lofts it straight over the bowler's head. Dead straight and comfortably over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good shot to end the over which will spoil a good over from {{BOWLER}}. Slightly overpitched, {{BATSMAN}} crouches low and launches it downtown over the bowler's head for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clobbered! Got hold of this alright, big {{BATSMAN}}! Slower ball on a shortish length, the South African picked it early and swatted it high over deep square leg. Much-needed one for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slips out of his hand into the half-tracker mark, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and launches that over long-on for a gigantic 82-meter six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you just can't bowl full to {{BATSMAN}}. Especially not at his pads, he will make you pay everytime. {{BOWLER}} went for the slower ball and {{BATSMAN}} accepts the gift, picks it away off his pads effortlessly over deep square leg for the first six of this innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just 4 runs off the over till this ball, so it should have been a smart {{BATSMAN}}livery, but {{BOWLER}}, having got away with a short slower ball first {{BATSMAN}}livery, tries again, but AB will feed on those anything within his bodyline at the end overs. Pulls, really high and into the stands over long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's back to taking the aggressive route again. Advances, takes it on the full and muscles it over the man at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he is playing a gem here. The slower delivery from {{BOWLER}} and he picked the bones out of that, set himself on leg-stump and swung through the line, the fielder at long-on was a mere spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stand and deliver stuff! Poetry in motion, this shot. Length ball alright but look at the way it's been put away by {{BATSMAN}}. Holds his shape and lifts it straight over {{BOWLER}}'s head. Straight as an arrow and clears the ropes with ease. Just a hit away now, {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} offers a little bit of flight and {{BATSMAN}} goes big. Down on his knees, gets maximum connection and pummels it over long-on.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, only a hit away from his fifty now. This was a full delivery outside off and {{BATSMAN}} smoked it over long-on for half a dozen. Great shot by the southpaw\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Maxi has arrived. \"The juices are flowing for Glenn {{BATSMAN}},\" Mike Hussey on air is all excited. Gets underneath a full delivery and sends it soaring into the stands over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ho, ho. Another dance down, cleaner to the pitch of it and smokes it into the sightscreen that's taken many a blow tonight. It's a steal, an under-broken-lights robbery. Hyderabad, call the cops!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, nicely tossed up on off, {{BATSMAN}} gets his left leg out of the way and swings through the line, plenty of height and way into the stands, long-off was a mere spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, has that gone the distance? Yeah, of course, it has! Right into the slot around off, slightly up, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles a touch in the crease, gets underneath the length and clubs it over long-on for the first big one of this evening in Dubai\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, only fair that {{BOWLER}} takes the brunt. It's outside off but it's enough for {{BATSMAN}}. Enough full, enough close. Slogged over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a beautiful shot! Jeepers, this kid is such a delight to watch when on song. Such class! Full and outside off, his bat face did turn in his hands but he got it dead straight even then. Cleared long-off easily\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ends the over with a maximum. A much needed one for {{TEAM}}. Bit of air on this and a fuller length meant {{BATSMAN}} was able to get underneath that, he heaves it high and over the cow corner fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he is putting on a show now. Not leaving any delivery that is in his arc. This was full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stays leg-side to give the room to open his arms, opens the bat face and slices it over point. Another biggie..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fabulous shot! To get such power behind that shot is incredible. {{BOWLER}} missed his yorker length by an inch or so, {{BATSMAN}} stayed on leg-stump and went through with the inside out loft, cleared the fence quite comfortably. Nice hands!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act. Oh boy! He's launched this out of the ground. Nicely tossed up, {{BATSMAN}} quickly used his feet and outsmarted the bowler, flaunts his muscle power and dismisses it over long-on. New balls please!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is wading into {{BOWLER}} now. Overbakes and bangs it short, {{BATSMAN}} can deal with short balls with ease. Sits back and muscles it way back into the deep mid-wicket stands. Into the second tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 50-run stand up between {{BATSMAN}} and Uthappa! Short of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and pulls it over mid-wicket to end the powerplay with a maximum. Good recovery by {{TEAM}} after the loss of Lynn in the first over of the innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX. Kaboom. Make that two in a row. {{BATSMAN}} wants to take the attack to the opposition. This time he fetches the ball from leg stump and goes spank over wide long-on. Madness...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh wow! What a hit and what a shot to finish. Just a whip of the wrists, {{BOWLER}}'s pace helped here, but he middled that so well. Leg-side line again from {{BOWLER}} with the yorker, just a flick with those rubber wrists. {{TEAM}} win with an over to spare\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX .. make it 27, and remember it's off {{BOWLER}} -- 3-0-5-2 and then 1-0-27-0 to ruin. It's a low full toss, and is smoked straight over his head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, has he got enough bat on it? Yes, he has. Nothing is going right for RCB. It was a full-toss on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} stays put in the crease and clobbers it over long-on for a flat six. It was inches over Hetmyer at long-on who leaps in the air but fails to reach it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, woah, that's massive. {{BATSMAN}}! He sat on his back knee and whacked this slog-sweep way back into the square leg stands. Do we have a match on here?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh what a shot! 23 off the last two overs now. A good little burst from these two. {{BOWLER}} still flights the ball up, the line is outside off and {{BATSMAN}} goes through the line to cream it beautifully over extra-cover. What timing on that. Way into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wo-aw. Picks up the length, with that jabby whip of his. And swishes it to split mid-on's left. It's a return show\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, picks the slower delivery and deposits the pull over the deep backward square leg fielder. Not that short, but with a half-swivel {{BATSMAN}} pulled that meatily and got himself a biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wowww! This is some hitting. Spare a thought for the bowler. {{BOWLER}} bowled a full delivery looking for some spin, {{BATSMAN}} gets down on one knee and slogs it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh ho ho! Middles this like a dream! That sound off the blade, wow! Back of a length, sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} who smokes it deep into the stands at mid-wicket. It was just a bit of a short arm jab, such power from the young man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stand and deliver! On a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} lines up for it and clubs it right over the bowler's head. Just manages to clear the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, highest ever total for Gujarat Lions! {{BATSMAN}} finishes the innings in style. That's Dhoni-esque. Slower shortish ball. {{BATSMAN}} waits and waits for it to come to him and smacks the pull over deep mid-wicket. 17 runs off the final over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles to the off-side slightly and scoops this fuller length ball over short fine leg for a maximum. Second six of the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is poor execution from Deepak {{BOWLER}}! He serves another leg-stump dross and it's been picked up neatly from the in-form {{BATSMAN}} who smokes it on one knee and sees the ball sailing over the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, okay! Never bowl within the bodyline to AB when he's looking for quick runs. The slower ball sat into the surfaces, {{BATSMAN}} hangs back and pulls over mid-wicket. Didn't bother running\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, googly on middle, {{BATSMAN}} gets down the wicket and tonks it straight down the ground over the sightscreen! Full swing of the blade, >360 degrees, and it sails away for an 89 meter six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh the bats. And the muscles. Helped by {{BOWLER}}'s want to bowl length and he just gives himself some room in swinging his bat as he lofts it high and mighty down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, had a good piece of that did Robin {{BATSMAN}}. Got underneath and marmalized a floater over long-on for a 83-metre maximum over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, going, going and gone! What a finish to the innings. It was full and in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and whacks it across the line. Enough power and it sails over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed! {{BATSMAN}}-show continues at the Chinnaswamy! This is high-quality hitting from the West Indian. It was short and was around face height, {{BATSMAN}} absolutely nails the pull shot. But he failed to get the elevation and Pandey at deep mid-wicket had a chance. But it was hit at such ferocious pace that it went through the hands of Pandey and went over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, goes over. And Kolkata keep the 16-pointer dream alive. Shortened length, {{BATSMAN}} deposits it into long-on with an all muscle heave\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, follows him in with the bouncer, but {{BATSMAN}}' undoing some of his rubbish with the ball. And this one's with a super hook, comfortably over fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, butter fingers everywhere for RCB. Gurkeerat at long-on messes it up. {{BATSMAN}} muscled it flat and straight to him, he got both hands but couldn't lock it in time. Terrible.. and morever, he tips it over the bar for SIX\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's backed away to a flat one that's intended to cramp him, and mowed it over deep mid-wicket for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, effortless flick from {{BATSMAN}} and it sails over the deep mid-wicket fielder's head for a maximum. It was floated on the pads, {{BATSMAN}}'s propensity on leg-stump balls is well documented. Just stays inside the line and latches onto the freebie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act now. Not so great bowling from {{BOWLER}}. Where's the googly mate? Just tosses another leg-break, {{BATSMAN}} pivots back, reads it and slogs it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full toss. {{BATSMAN}} loves that. Clears the front leg and muscles it over the deep square leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely shot, Pune need more of those, {{BATSMAN}} skips down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it high and over long-on for a maximum. Chants of MS, MS from the crowd.. Can he make a big score here?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's flown away like it belongs to the stands. Full pace at 136ks and steaming into the pads, and {{BATSMAN}}'s just flunked it over backward square leg with a bat swing. Sounds easy, right?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} flies out of the blocks! He runs out of patience and shows Michael Jackson footwork. Reaches the pitch this time and lifts it high up in the air. Didn't get it off the middle but enough to clear the man at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you beauty! {{BATSMAN}} on beast mode. Only 14 needed now. In the right slot, {{BATSMAN}} has smacked it over deep mid. 20 off the over already. What have you done Mr. {{BOWLER}}?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this guy is a positive batsman. What a wonderful way to get off the mark. Sinks low on one knee and smacks the slog sweep over deep backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's a tie and we have a Super Over!! Whew! What.A.Game. After all that long, never-ending confab {{BOWLER}} delivers a juicy length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} keeps his calm and marmalizes it into the mid-wicket orbit for a scintillating maximum. {{BATSMAN}} knew it was six the moment it left the bat and he pumps his fists before soaking in joy. Rohit doesn't seem too pleased and he is busy picking balls for the Super Over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, onto one knee! The story after that is scripted. The author - {{BATSMAN}} just looks into the stands. The ball has disappeared into the stands at the cow corner region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the air and out she goes! It was an off-pace delivery wide of off at 129kph, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and launches it into the cow corner fence. It came off the sweet spot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, \"That's the 500th six of the tournament,\" informs Sanjay Manjrekar on air. {{BOWLER}} offers a full ball in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} sets up a solid base of off and launches it over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fractionally short outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stays low and shuffles across, gets under it and pulls it flat to deep mid-wicket. Goes just over the rope for six. Magnificent hitting.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you simply can't bowl short to this man - not at {{BOWLER}}'s pace, back of a length and from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} made room and swung - didn't get hold of the shot, but has enough to sail over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, half-tracker at the stumps, swatted into the grass banks behind midwicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh my! KXIP won't be liking this. They don't want to run into {{BATSMAN}} on the wrong night. And so far, the signs are ominous. {{BATSMAN}} exposes his stumps again, backs away, and smokes a low full toss over extra-cover. Flat six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, isn't to pitch, but boy! Look at that bat swing. The Gabbar seems to be in full flow. Fetches it from outside off and takes {{BOWLER}} for a journey over long-on. The crowd are excited, why not!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, if one shot could be included in the wikipedia page of 'power', this is it. 101 metres from {{BATSMAN}}. Slogs across the line and puts a lot of flesh on it to send it over the deep mid-wicket fence. Was hit with the turn, yes a googly it was\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh there's a plan. There's surely a plan, and {{BOWLER}} is the villan in that plan. {{BATSMAN}}'s quick to sink down, pick the sitting-up length, get under it and smoke it into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's nailed over long-on, 50-run stand up. Also the fastest team fifty in IPL 2019. {{BATSMAN}} puts on his dancing shoes and thumps the short ball over the fence, just clears it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, one boundary and {{BATSMAN}} has found his touch. Flighted delivery and it is in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} extends his arms and lofts it straight back over {{BOWLER}}, all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, tries a little too much with his action, fires it into middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets on his knee and sweeps it high and mighty over deep backward square leg for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 50 up for {{TEAM}} in 23 balls! Head-high bouncer, {{BATSMAN}} isn't perplexed by that. He is on the front foot to pummel the pull well in front of square on the leg-side. The deep mid-wicket fielder is just a spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, woah! This is even better. {{BOWLER}} went for the change of pace and {{BATSMAN}} spotted it, he made room and waited to play the inside out loft, sent it just over the deep extra cover fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, vintage Yuvi! Greets {{BOWLER}} to the crease with a maximum. Floated up in the swinging arc for him, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and smokes it into the deep mid-wicket stands. Too easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the first six of the evening - on a good length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} got forward on the lofted drive, didn't time it all that well - ended up slicing it high and over mid-off - has enough to clear the ropes on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dishes out full pace and goes 73 meters. It's right in the slot too as {{BATSMAN}} lines up and tonks it straight back. Two balls, two hits and Delhi's asking rate falls down by an entire run ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, kaboooooom! Another one! {{BATSMAN}} is on the rampage now. Fuller in length around off, he just stands deep in the crease and belts this over long-on. Comfortably clears the fielder over there. The skipper is infusing momentum back into the innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, launched over square leg! {{BATSMAN}} continues in his merry ways. Fractionally short in length and he swivels a touch before propelling this with a strong bottom hand. In the air for quite a while and had enough legs to clear the fence. He is switching gears here, is {{BATSMAN}} and DD do need to up the ante. Looks a good batting surface\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gets into the position early. Stays in the crease and dispatches this carom ball through square leg. Wafting it across\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hit through the line and off she goes into the stands. Seam-up, half-volley on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} bends his back knee and smokes it over long-on. Off the meat of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, pressure? {{BATSMAN}} just doesn't know what that means. Sets himself up for a shorter length delivery, clears his front leg and goes tonkkkkkkk straight of long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slog-swept by {{BATSMAN}} and six over deep square. Went down quickly and sheer timing on the shot sees the ball sail into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh well {{BATSMAN}} will do THE Dhoni. It was full, allowing him to come forward and then free up his hands to whip the tonk long, deep, over cow corner. 6 wickets | 19 balls remain ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, last match they had a fielder just behind the keeper, very fine and he was caught. Not this time. Just reverse-laps a full-toss and it goes all the way. The {{TEAM}} dugout love it. {{BATSMAN}} is known to be innovative and he is showing us why\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a stunning shot! {{BATSMAN}} moved leg-side and {{BOWLER}} follows him with a bumper. {{BATSMAN}} has no problems whatsoever as he hooks it over square leg. No fielder there and {{BATSMAN}} collects another maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh so very defensive. {{BOWLER}} continues firing them wide outside off to cut off {{BATSMAN}}'s leg-side play - square of the wicket he goes slicing, flat over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 180-degrees on the other side from the one he'd intended to go over. But the maximums only keep coming. Gets the ball to climb up awkwardly does {{BOWLER}} getting it up on the ribs and {{BATSMAN}} just swings his bat looking to go over cow corner again with the familiar hits. Gets the familiar result though with the top-edge flying over the cordon. And his third half-century of this season too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a googly too short and {{BATSMAN}} thrashes it. Shortish delivery and down the leg-side, sits up nicely, {{BATSMAN}} sends that over the mid-wicket boundary. Fifty up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cleared the boundary with utmost ease this time. He looks in his elements today. Again, charges down the ground, wasn't to the pitch but he swings his willow hard and gets enough bat on it to pump it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 10 off the first two. This is a fabulous shot. Length ball around off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and then brings his bat down in a straight arc, sending the ball sailing over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}}, hitting of the highest order from the former India captain. This was tossed up on off, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and thumps it high and over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}, width on offer from {{BOWLER}}. He stays in his crease, uses his hands to good effect, makes the most of {{BOWLER}}'s pace and helps it high and over third man for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he has his intentions clear! That has been swiped clean as a whistle. Knelt down and swept it big for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, can you believe it? An injured MS {{BATSMAN}} has hit a six with one hand. Take a bow sir! Low full toss, no one at deep square, {{BATSMAN}} backs himself, has an excellent willow in his hand and swings across the line and over the boundary line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a glorious shot! {{BOWLER}} bangs it short without any venom behind it. {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and launches it over long-off. See the ball and hit the ball. He hit that and stood for the photographs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is a buffet delivery for {{BATSMAN}}. He is just waiting for that length - back of a length, he waits for the ball to arrive and pumps it flat over deep mid-wicket. Six #3!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, goes big again! That's outta here as well. Flighted ball, {{BATSMAN}} decided to free his arms and pump it over long-on for a sixer. {{TEAM}} want an early finish\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it was raining 30 minutes back at Kotla and it's raining sixes now. {{BATSMAN}} shuffles in the crease a bit to disturb the length of the bowler, his base was stable and more importantly his connection was clean. Ball has gone into the stands over deep mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he'll bite the bait. Is happy to go against the turn, milking the last ball of the powerplay that doesn't allow a deep mid-wicket - sitting on a knee and slogging it over. Cleanly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh he's made up for those dot balls! A fuller length delivery with a bit of width, right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} swings through the line and runs those massive arms through it - lofts it high and mighty into the crowd in the deep extra cover region for six! Strike-rate back at 100!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, high and long. Right into the KKR dugout. {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker and it is a full delivery, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't get hold of the loft but you don't need much to clear the fences here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has deposited it into the stands. It was a fuller length ball and {{BATSMAN}} lofts it with a straight bat over the bowler's head for a sixer\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the last ball he smacked back to the bowler, but this one he has smacked out of the park. Right into the slot around middle as {{BATSMAN}} smokes it over deep mid-wicket. High and handsome!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 120kph. In the back of a length zone just outside off, but {{BATSMAN}}'s happy to open up his cards early - which are the same cards he's been trying to deal with all over - backing away and then generating enough power in this lofted tonk of sorts. It looked like he only had the height on first impression, but no, the legs are there, over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's flown off {{BATSMAN}}'s bat. He walks stone-faced to the middle of the pitch and punches gloves with Buttler. Slow ball sitting up and {{BATSMAN}} mowing it over cow corner has to be a sight to behold\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he moves leg, moves to the off-side again, picks up the good length ball on the stumps to ramp it over fine leg for another six. Last 9 balls: 6 fours, 3 sixes.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is teeing off. Third six off {{BOWLER}}. Spots the shorter ball early, skips back and flat-bats it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, long-on's there. He's waiting. He reaches out .. and watches it fly fast. That's the hit. {{BOWLER}} tries another one of his shorter balls, but {{BATSMAN}}'s not missing this. He's mowing them over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, effortless stroke from Vijay {{BATSMAN}}! Lets the googly dip and marmalizes it for a 84-metre maximum over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} finally connects one and when he connects it, ball stays hit. A great hit though. Flat-batted slog over the fence. He goes on the knees and strikes it cleanly, ball sails over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, into the stands and the crowd are on their feet. Picks the length early on this short one and swivels quickly to pull that over square leg. Was on to his pull in a flash on that occasion\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX. That's dismissive. Precise, mathematic middle of the bat. No feet, allows his wrists to take over. The gift of timing. Flat-footed, takes on the short and wide ball, thumps it flat over extra cover. Fetch that!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, as anticipated, the extra ball goes the distance. How often do we see this? Short and wide outside off, plenty of time for {{BATSMAN}} to free his arms. Throws the kitchen sink and plays an upper cut as the ball sails over deep point for the first maximum of the evening. Frustrated is {{BOWLER}} as he spoils his over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, even the tallest man in the team can't get a finger on that. Tossed up around off, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and drags the loft towards long-on. Morris was a few yards inside the rope and the ball sailed over his leap. If he had been on the edge, who knows\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he finishes it with a swat. In style. But it is Pune who'll be celebrating. They've breached the fortress. A lovely strike on the ball with {{BATSMAN}} clearing his front leg and slogs it out of the park. Through his favourite area - mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, this was the leg-break, but the line was too full, allowed {{BATSMAN}} to get underneath the ball and lift it back over his head, went all the way for the first maximum of the chase, for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now then, now then! That was a shot to make a statement. National selectors, please note. How hard did he hit that? Walked slightly across the line, expectedly got the slower ball and muscled that over the mid-wicket boundary. How poor was {{BOWLER}} to opt for a slower ball for the fourth successive time?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, two gifts from {{BOWLER}} and both have disappeared. Full toss just below the waist, {{BATSMAN}} says thank you very much and launches it into the stands near deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is looking in good touch, length delivery outside off, he was quick to shuffle across, gets into a good position and heaves it over the mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another effortless shot! Stands tall and lofts the length delivery right over the bowler's head for a half a dozen. Took one hand off the handle but the timing was just so fantastic\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 133.3km/h, normal pace, on a back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and transfers his weight onto that through-the-line loft over deep extra cover for six! Fantastic hit!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good cricket awareness from {{BATSMAN}} as he knew {{BOWLER}} will pitch it up, he does and {{BATSMAN}} swings through the line and cleanly to get another six over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length delivery going across and has been lifted away over deep long-off for a sixer. Poor choice of ball and has been deposited over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, pulled away! Was a short delivery on leg and {{BATSMAN}} had plenty of time to heave it over the fine leg fence. The crowd is slowly getting its voice back\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it keeps coming! It keeps coming! 4 out of 4 for {{BATSMAN}}! Floated up on middle and off, he gets across on one leg and clobbers the slog sweep over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. Oh boy, this is some exhibition!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, into the 90s now.. {{BOWLER}} offers a friendly full toss just below the waist, {{BATSMAN}} deep in the crease is set up for a heave into the leg-side, the ball was right in his arc and he swings it away 20 rows back near deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, nothing edgy about this one. Full on off, a clean bat swing from {{BATSMAN}} and the white ball soars into the long-off stands. Great end to the powerplay for {{TEAM}} and {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow, what execution! Gets right under this full ball and lap-sweeps it all the way over short fine leg. Just never looks hurried at all. Quickly took a step across, got down low and again, lovely timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} misses the length and pays the price. Lands it right in the swinging arc and {{BATSMAN}} ain't missing out, clears his front leg to get and strikes it cleanly over the long-off fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} joins into the act. High percentage shot this. Hauls his back leg in the air and elegantly swipes it into the deep square leg stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the march to the double ton gets another gear. And some help from Chahal in tipping it over the fence. {{BATSMAN}} opens up and uses his entire height to good effect in his tall pull. Mid-wicket takes another one in its kitty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short one angled into the body, gets behind the line and transfers his weight onto the backfoot to deposit it over deep mid-wicket for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, serves it up in the zone and gets punished. {{BATSMAN}} shows no mercy as he clears his front leg and dismisses it straight down the ground for half-a-dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over CDG, this was tossed up on off, {{BATSMAN}} got a big stride forward and lifted it with the turn, high and towards long-on. CDG looked very interested for the catch, went with his outstretched right hand, but only tipped it over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is turning it on here. This was bowled slightly outside off, doesn't matter to {{BATSMAN}}. He crouches slightly low and clouts it over long-on. He's timing it brilliantly. Time to target him with pace?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gee! How on earth did he get this away for a six? {{BOWLER}} has a wry smile on his face. This was a mis-hit from {{BATSMAN}}, lost his balance as he threw everything at it. Skews it off the cue-end and got plenty of height. He placed it in the gap over mid-wicket and in the end, it soared over the ropes for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, all the way. If you're going short to {{BATSMAN}}, it better be nice and high. This one sits up around his chest and he dismisses it from his presence over the mid-wicket boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, goes for a big one and dispatches it over deep mid-wicket. He is taking a liking to {{BOWLER}}! He goes down on his knees and slog sweeps it for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} won't hang around blocking. Definitely not against a left-arm spinner. Was bulleted on off, {{BATSMAN}} stood tall and smoked it over cow corner. Swung hard\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, RCB beat {{TEAM}} by 10 runs! Let me take a breather! An offbreak by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} ends the match with a maximum by smoking it down the ground. Not enough though as the Royal Challengers clinch their second win of the season\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}}'s slower ball goes awry. It was the knuckle ball and {{BATSMAN}} spotted it early. Squated low and helped it over short fine leg. Clears the rope for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, welcome to the attack {{BOWLER}}! Dragged back length and {{BATSMAN}} makes room to thump the pull over deep mid-wicket. That is a monster hit from the Aussie and he remains the key for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is the problem with yorkers, you can't miss it by much. Nice juicy full toss and {{BATSMAN}} said thank you very much by depositing it into the cow corner fence for half a dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} became predictable there. He was targeting {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, missed his length and the Kiwi got underneath that, swung it over the long leg fence and the short Kotla boundaries took care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lofted for six with one hand. How well has he timed this. It appeared that {{BATSMAN}} might have been beaten for the lack of pace and was into the loft too early, evidenced by his bottom hand coming off. But mid-off was up, so he had the confidence to go through with it. Ends up getting it right off the middle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's a slower ball alright, but this bloke is picking them from the hand, so he's being disguised, nicely gets under the ball and smashes it over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whack! Too predictable lengths from {{BOWLER}}. The slower ball, tad shorter. {{BATSMAN}} picked it up early, employs his strong bottom-hand into play to muscle it over deep mid-wicket, clears the rope for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, much needed for {{BATSMAN}} and Mumbai. Picked the carrom ball on the sticks, cleared the front leg and smoked it through the line straight back over the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you can't miss your length by an inch when Universe Boss is in this mood. Attempted yorker goes wrong, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in his crease, makes it into an overpitched delivery and larrups it straight down the ground for a massive six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, muscled over cow corner. A 92-metre hit from {{BATSMAN}}. Got the required length from {{BOWLER}}, who perhaps missed his yorker and {{BATSMAN}} punishes it with a massive strike, sending into the empty second tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's in his half and {{BATSMAN}} has clubbed that straight back over the bowler. Clears his front leg, gets underneath and goes bam!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, punishes the slower ball this time. He set himself up for it and launched it over wide long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's deep into the crowd! After a series of good deliveries, {{BOWLER}} loses his composure. Tries the yorker to be fair to him but it ends up as a juicy full toss. Clubbed away way over deep square leg. 108 meters it is! Second longest one of the tournament\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, patent those quick strong tentacles! Low full toss, missed the mark by an inch and has to pay for it. Whips it over deep backward square for a sixer. Cruel stuff from the batter. Four inch perfect deliveries and you miss one ball and are made to pay for it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the arc out of the park. Full length delivery, a knuckle ball and {{BATSMAN}} with a lot of authority picks it up over wide long-on, would have been a six on any ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, absolutely smoked! A googly on leg and middle, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track and swings it against the turn over cow corner for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's miscued .. and six. He didn't get that like he wanted at all. A big mow from {{BATSMAN}}, the ball grips and catches him on the outside half of the bat and it goes all the way. Ridiculous. Finch, at long on, is left bemused\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and he finishes with a six. This is a tremendous over for RCB. Watches the slower {{BATSMAN}}livery and carves it high and wi{{BATSMAN}} over long-off. Pure power and CdG ends the innings in style. Boy o boy did RCB need that or what\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} errs and {{BATSMAN}} pounces. Shortens the length and angles one on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets into a good position with a slight shuffle and shoves it over mid-wicket. Goes all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} does this. Drops it harmlessly on a back of a length on leg-stump, and {{BATSMAN}}'s been served a pie. Helps it over fine leg with a good arm swing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's upping the strike-rate as well. Flighted delivery down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} gets to the pitch of the ball by advancing and slogs over wide long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, swivels on the back foot and pulls it handsomely over deep mid for a sixer. Superb hit as he was quick to pick the length on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a flat hit! Tells you what one confident stroke can do. {{BATSMAN}} is now striking them well. The short ball and he swivels to get inside the line before pulling over short fine leg. Clears the ropes as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fuller length delivery just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} preempts the periscope and laps it over the tiny fine leg boundary for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's tonked this over mid-wicket. Finally the acceleration from {{BATSMAN}}. Picks the ball from outside off and slogs cleanly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Rishabh {{BATSMAN}}, you beauty! This is some stunning cricket we're witnessing here. He takes on the short ball, and pulls it away over the fine leg boundary. It was a thick top-edge there actually but with {{BOWLER}}'s pace, it travelled\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, thumped away! Floated googly and fuller outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was on the charge and although this was wider in line, he trusted his strong bottom hand to launch. And launch he did, flat over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} welcomes {{BOWLER}} with a lovely off-driven six. Length delivery just outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} waits and lofts it easily over the top. {{BOWLER}} was surprised how {{BATSMAN}} managed to time it so well despite there being no wild swing of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is ruining {{BOWLER}}'s figures here, slower and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and thumps it high and wide of long-on, has the power to sail over the ropes, back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's inexperience for you from the bowler. He was troubling {{BATSMAN}} with the inswingers, this is the final ball of his second over, he may not be given the third, so now he tries something different from what was working and gets smashed. Short and rising, {{BATSMAN}} nonchalantly pulls over square leg. How good a shot was that?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, almost an unbelievable catch. Boult snatched one in the last game. Billings just missing out with an incredible effort. Slogged in the air from outside off and Billings on the run from deep mid, stretched his right-hand out at full tilt but took the ball with him beyond the ropes. Had he caught that, would've been one of the all-time great catches\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, nothing wild about this one, sets himself on one knee and launches Bhajji for a many-a-mile over mid-wicket. Clean as a whistle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he is upping the ante now. It was a nothing delivery, banged in around hip-height. {{BATSMAN}} gets in a good position and powers the pull shot over deep mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, well, well .. don't go anywhere. This partnership has raced away to 22 off 9. {{BOWLER}} deviates from the slower ball strategy, bowls it full and wide of off and {{BATSMAN}} spanks him over mid-off. That's gone all the way. Flat six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bashes this into the crowd. The way he took stance, it was clear he fancied a bite of {{BOWLER}}. Sensing this, {{BOWLER}} blinked. He dropped it short and was muscled over midwicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length ball? That was a poor one from {{BOWLER}} and has disappeared over long-on. {{BATSMAN}} expanded his long handle into the shot and smoked it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a massive shot! No doubt, it's {{BATSMAN}}. Slightly short, {{BATSMAN}} sees it and is quick to jump back in his crease. Pummels the pull into the deep mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, much needed. Courtesy {{BATSMAN}}. Walks across, stands tall and gives the sitting up short one a real spank in getting it to fly over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there are some ways to bring up a half-century and there is this way. A gallop down the track, right forward and swings his bat massively to deposit this well into the stands down the ground. His #11 I'm told\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! Seemed to be a mishit but Warner watches it sail over him. Full, slow and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lofts it off the base of the bat and it soars just over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just a pick up shot and cleared the rope by quite some distance. Bit of air on this delivery, {{BATSMAN}} uses his long reach to get under that and sends it sailing over deep mid-wicket. Jaddu under the pump\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bursts through the hands. Oh Morgan. Such has been the standard set these days that you expect these to be picked out. A low full toss here and {{BATSMAN}} reaches out on a knee, almost rolls over in the process too. But imparts the final few breaths of energy in him to loft it over long-off, where Morgan gets his hands up but in the quest of keeping himself inside the rope lets the ball sneak through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, .. and {{BATSMAN}} makes the most of the free-hit. Another pretty poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and pulls it high and over mid-wicket, went sailing into the stands for the first six of IPL 10\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} joins into the act. {{BOWLER}} drifted it wide of off but {{BATSMAN}} managed to reach with his long levers and launches it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, wow! What's more it is a no-ball as well. For height. Over the waist. Full-toss gone wrong and he has belted that into the crowd at {{BATSMAN}}ep square. That hit brings the ladies on their feet - with one even whistling away to glory\n",
            "Nav{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 143ks dug in short at the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} picks the length slightly late but he has such won{{BATSMAN}}rful hands and he clouts it for a 77-metre maximum over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot - made it even more special as he was done in completely by the flight. {{BOWLER}} saw his coming, slowed down the pace, dragged it wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} reached out and slaps it back over the bowler's head, all the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ahh, that was even better than the previous six. Short delivery again, {{BATSMAN}} transfers his weight on to the back foot and murders it over square leg with a pull, 96 metre biggie that one, this is why he's in the team\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good feet use in coming down the pitch and then he milks his form. Swings, lofting a hoick over long-on, and just over the fielder's jump\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's dumped over long-off. {{TEAM}} cantering away to victory. Just a few blows away if they go at this rate. Too full from {{BOWLER}} and it's criminal with mid-off up. {{BATSMAN}} launches it over the infield and it goes away for a flat maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, typical inside-out shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Triggers his back leg, creates some room to this full ball and lifts it beautifully over cover. The timing was supreme and it clears the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there's his arc. You genius. Reads the fuller sucker that's to follow, sits, shuffles and it's behind square. In less than a second. Oh the nerve!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Vijay was waiting for the ball, but it goes over his head. A 62m six! Slightly wayward from {{BOWLER}}. Short of a good length straying down leg, {{BATSMAN}} stays deep and moves towards off to help it along its way. A superb pick-up shot over fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 99.9kph. Wide floaty, loopy off-break. {{BATSMAN}} lays in, this is bang in his zone, and slices this typically over deep extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, first ball {{BATSMAN}} faces in the IPL, he smashes it over long leg. A short ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} swings into an instinctive pull and gets enough on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, phew! That's been nailed for six. Short delivery from round the wicket. {{BATSMAN}} rocks on the back foot quicker and dispatches it with a pull over deep square leg fence. Pure power that from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, one-handed shovel over deep mid-wicket! The Wankhede is roaring in delight. Whoa! Fantastic scenes at the moment. {{BOWLER}} loses his composure, gives a full toss and he's overstepped too, so many blunders and it's picked over deep mid-wicket. Just another mishit you know, but that's the big man for you\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finally gets some bat on it! Was trying to do this since ages. Clears his front leg and pumps the length delivery over long-off for a flat six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the slot and out of the park. {{BOWLER}} getting a taste of his own medicine. Wafted it full just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} with a solid base on leg-stump, gets under it and with strong wrists, whacks it into the deep mid stands. Into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's classic Virat {{BATSMAN}} for you! Flighted delivery just outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} lofts the inside-out drive from the middle of the bat, hits the rope on the full. Stand and deliver stuff\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}}, tad too short from RJ, allows {{BATSMAN}} to rock back and pull it hard and over mid-wicket for another maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} is trying too many things. First ball - leggie. Second - googly. Third - the front of the hand slider, {{BATSMAN}} flat-bats it over extra cover. Just about has enough wings to clear the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 138.6kph, misses his yorker and worse - he's got reverse swing on it as well - but it's bang in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} also makes it worse by getting deep in the crease as he whips it uppishly, high and over deep mid-wicket. Hardik doesn't help himself either at the boundary, running in at first, and then having to go back .. watches in the nd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}'s been made to fetch this from outside off. He does so and swipes over midwicket. Just clears the boundary with this 75-metre hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is brute power from CdG. Brutal from the Zimbawean-turned-Kiwi. Waited for the slower {{BATSMAN}}livery and then slapped it high and powerfully over extra-cover. Kohli smiles and claps\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, talk about ruining something. Yes, this is just that. For some wierd reason, {{BOWLER}} goes for the yorker, Carlos shows us how the world remembered his name in the first place. By depositing it into long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! {{BATSMAN}} has had his problems against the short ball this season, not this time though. Picked the short of length delivery early, transfers his weight onto the back foot and nails the pull over deep square leg. Went a long way back into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh what a freebie, and what a time for it. Any pressure that had built on {{TEAM}} has evaporated. Slower short ball on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} whip-pulls it witheringly over the long leg boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} had the better off {{BOWLER}} in the reverse fixture and nothing has changed. Tossed up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes through the line and the loft travels all the way over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}}. This was a full length delivery on middle, {{BATSMAN}} stayed rooted and timed his loft right over the bowler. Straight as an arrow and over the boundary ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another six that is just over.. {{BOWLER}} bowls the slower delivery on short of length, Mo picked the bones out of that, he was expecting this and it was right in his arc, hammers it over a leaping deep mid-wicket fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is a buffet delivery for {{BATSMAN}}. He is just waiting for that length - back of a length, he waits for the ball to arrive and pumps it flat over deep mid-wicket. Six #3!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, launcheddddd! AB in this form... wow. Fullish off-cutter outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} sizes it up and biffs it over mid-off. Sails into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a six and a half! Into the top tier. {{BOWLER}} floats it up right into the slot outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, and that's all the swinging room which {{BATSMAN}} needs as he sinks on his knees and {{BATSMAN}}stroys it over wi{{BATSMAN}} long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, muscled away by {{BATSMAN}}! Once again, not off the middle but who cares when he can clear the ropes? Makes room and swings through the line over long-on. More off the toe-end but it goes deep into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stand and deliver. That's a 104 meter six! Gets to his fifty in a grand style. Right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} to swing his bat. Sees the width outside off, comes forward and blasts it over long-on. The ball is out of the stadium. New balls please. He takes some piece of the sand from the turf and pours it on his bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, {{BATSMAN}} was sent in to do some pinch-hitting and he's doing exactly that. Length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward, drives it through the line and sends it high and over the fence at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short and sits up at perfect height for {{BATSMAN}} who powers the pull flat and hard over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now sends it over Russell. Not connected properly, but the small boundaries aid him in. Shuffled across to the conventional chinaman and heaved it with a bent back knee over long-on, just over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gee, this cutter gets a treatment even worse. Drags it from outside off too -- meaning imagine the biceps he's built -- and then carts it over cow corner with a little bit of a crouch. Ungainly looking but effective\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, top-edge and over the keeper. Oh, in fact, it's gone all the way. Fortune favouring {{BATSMAN}} at the moment. {{BOWLER}} bends his back and digs it into the pitch, {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull and gets a fat top-edge to his benefit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is the second time {{BATSMAN}} has slogged across the line off {{BOWLER}}. And like the previous occasion makes good connection again, sending it deep into the stands at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gets to his fifty in style! It's a short delivery and {{BATSMAN}} camps back and slaughters it over Stokes at long-on. Reaches the milestone and raises his bat, acknowledges the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a {{BATSMAN}} special. {{BOWLER}} darts the quicker front of the hand stuff. And he darts it half way down the pitch as well. All the time for {{BATSMAN}} to rock back and swat him away. High and mighty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the next ball goes for six. Length ball on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} heaves and clears deep mid. Just. But that will do\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, drops it so short that it was on its way down when reaching {{BATSMAN}}. And he does so well to generate power, which isn't always the easiest thing with such deliveries. Slaps it over the extra cover boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, make that two in a row. Over long-on this time. Good hand-eye coordination as he smears the ball with a clean swing of the willow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, no missing this time around. Watches the ball like a hawk, sets himself deep inside the crease and smokes the full ball straight back over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a six off the final ball and 16 runs to cap off the over. {{BATSMAN}} is getting a move on here. Motions out of his crease to meet the pitch and allows his bottom hand to take over. Blasted disdainfully over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh my! This would have been a six in any ground. Googly around off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} keeps his head down and then has a clean bat swing to send it soaring into the roads over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's that. A real mockery this. A target of almost 200 and Mumbai do it with time to spare to go after another. {{BOWLER}} meanwhile bends his back in banging it half way down the track and {{BATSMAN}} just swivels as he hooks it into the second floor. Over long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hint of flight and {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes light up. Loads up big time and clears his front leg to deposit into the empty stands over long-off. First six of the innings!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, no edges this time. Down the track and over deep mid. Didn't get to the pitch but once it is in his range, he decides to deposit the tossed up delivery into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive over for {{TEAM}}, 22 off it. Short of length on leg stump, pulls it away ferociously and hits the cushions on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, that's a big bonus for {{TEAM}}, it's a maximum and it's a big no-ball as well. On a good length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} takes a step forward and carves it high and over cover, went a long way into the stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a strike. Full and in the slot for {{BATSMAN}}, he flexes his muscles and smokes it a long way into the long-on stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}}. Are we in for a {{BATSMAN}}-storm at the Wankhede! There was hardly any effort behind it. He just waits for the delivery to arrive, it was in his arc around his off-stump and he lifts it over deep mid-wicket for another maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short one angling away outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} plays a southpaw's forehand and absolutely slaughters that over {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket for six. That's an absolutely stunning shot...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} turns back and smiles. That's all he could do. Ridiculous T20 batting on display. {{BATSMAN}} shuffles and scoops a pacy length ball over the keeper's head, lands just over the advertising triangles. Back to back sixes for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the slog mode is on. Oh it better be. Is quickly on a knee with the bat turning into a slogging monster as he swings across the line and goes high and mighty into the cow corner stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a fantastic hook! @136.2km/h, not the quickest or steepest of bumpers, {{BATSMAN}} gets back and across, into the front-on position early, gets under the short one and swivels into a fantastic hook over fine leg for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, insult to injury! Missed on a wicket on the last ball and goes for a six on the very next ball. Shortish delivery, a half-tracker and {{BATSMAN}} pummels it over wide long-on for a towering six, that was huge again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this one drifts in on leg, sliding on with the arm, and {{BATSMAN}} just lifts it through the line over long-on. A shot requiring great ability, especially as he's not to the pitch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length ball and it disappears. That has been hoicked away into the on-side and that has landed many-a-miles into the deep mid region. He picked it up like he was picking roses in a garden\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's the biggest of the lot! {{BATSMAN}} on fire...picks up the flight, gets underneath it and hammers it high and soaring into the second tier over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, makes room to a length ball and slaps this over extra cover. Oh the wonders of batting in Sharjah, hitting through the line like this\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is walking off thinking it is the end of the over. But someone tells him there's a ball to go. He was off there thinking the job is done. Short and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and flat-bats it straight over {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good start this from {{BATSMAN}}. He picked the previous two deliveries and now he gets his dancing shoes on to get to the pitch of the ball. It's followed by his trademark flourish to launch it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 99.9kph. Wide floaty, loopy off-break. {{BATSMAN}} lays in, this is bang in his zone, and slices this typically over deep extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hit hard, hit flat, six! {{BATSMAN}}, you have been missed. That's sensational ball-striking. It's very full from {{BOWLER}}, most players won't be able to get under it but {{BATSMAN}}'s wrists and the power he generates are something else. A {{BATSMAN}} special\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely from {{BATSMAN}}, he's showing why he's the number one T20I batsman in the world. This was tossed up on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} bent down on his knees and swept it high and over deep mid-wicket, deep into the crowd for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, into the second tier. Mumbai need to step on the pedal. Bit of air as {{BOWLER}} tossed it wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} charged down and had the room to free his arms, smashed it over extra cover for a biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a clanger. Maxwell, what have you done? Knuckle ball from {{BOWLER}}, on a fuller length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} tonks it straight down the ground, Maxwell prances to his left from long-off, gets both hands but palms it over the ropes. Clumsy!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, vintage {{BATSMAN}} finishes off the innings in style. A hat-trick of sixes for the big man as he bludgeons this one over the bowler's head. Mumbai end with 191/4\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, geez! He's looks so good while playing positively. Banged in halfway down, {{BATSMAN}} waits for the ball to climb on him and ramps it over third man, Bumrah could only collect it from the dugout\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's deep into the crowd! Plenty of power from {{BATSMAN}} on this stroke. He's smoked it away. Short of a length and he is now expecting this length. Sits deep in the crease to clobber the pull away by standing tall. Meaty blow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, once more not off the meat but the power of {{BATSMAN}} ensures it goes sailing over the rope. It was a freebie from {{BOWLER}}, juicy full toss and {{BATSMAN}} goes straight, clearing the boundary quite comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that has gone out of the stadium. Things that T20 cricket do, Hashim {{BATSMAN}} can hit the long ball. What's more amazing is the power he generated behind the shot, {{BATSMAN}} picks the change of pace and spank-banged it over the top-tier over long-off with a bat velocity of 135KPH\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over deep mid-wicket! Kishan was the fielder there and he leapt as much as he could but it went well over him. A taller fielder, Pollard perhaps, could have had a better chance. Take nothing away from {{BATSMAN}} though, this is a cracking stroke. Picked the slower ball early and though he had to fetch it from outside off, did so with a cross-batted slap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, my word, hasn't he clobbered this or what! {{BATSMAN}} is going bonkers here! Gets one slightly too short from {{BOWLER}} and belts the pull over deep backward square leg. Absolutely waded into the pull and sent it deep into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how easy was that? {{BATSMAN}} has been in good touch, getting starts this season. This was a short delivery down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} easily pulls it over long leg as he got inside the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the 400th six of the tournament and it has come from MS. No fuss, just a touch outside his crease, picks the bones out of a half-volley and golf-swings it straight down the ground for a 80-plus metre maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finally! Finally, a sweetly timed shot by VK! Down on his knee in a jiffy as he pumps the floated delivery over deep mid-wicket for a flat six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this could be over pretty soon. {{BATSMAN}} is surely relishing captaincy, Australia are you watching? Clears his front leg and smites the heck off a short delivery, backs away and makes a clean connection, goes seething over a helpless third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, no problems with connecting this one from the middle of the bat. Length ball right in the slot and he's in the mood to swing at everything, lofts down the ground, goes over mid-on and goes all the way. Somehow, {{BATSMAN}} has raced to 33 off 17 balls\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow. Okay Google - search for descriptions. {{BOWLER}} errs for a change, letting the length sit up in {{BATSMAN}} arc .. and that arc's ever-expanding. Flat-bats, high and into long-on. Save your faces\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, that should break the shackles for {{TEAM}} and {{BATSMAN}}, this was a high full-toss from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} was already pre-meditating the reverse sweep, ends up playing the switch hit and sends it high and over deep point for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cannot bowl there to {{BATSMAN}}, he'll feast on it. Banged short by {{BOWLER}} but it's not that high. Sits up nicely for the Australian who powers the pull over deep mid-wicket. One of Watto's favorite hitting zones\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Gets there in style. First for him in this IPL. Needs to keep going though. Fetched it from well outside off, might have been a wide had he let go, but he doesn't and swipes it across the line flat over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slogged, and bursting straight through a jumping Rahane at deep mid-wicket -- for {{BATSMAN}}'s 301st T20 six. Anyway, it's helped the equation come under three runs per ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, drills this straight back down the ground. {{BOWLER}} misses out on the blockhole by a few inches and is hammered by Patel. He's playing a good little knock here. But this chase is beyond his powers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, didn't I tell ya? {{BATSMAN}} loves to murder spin, especially when it's tossed up fuller and at this ground, hitting that for six is just a formality. Clobbered over cow corner. Easy as you like\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Delhi have their highest ever run-chase. {{BATSMAN}} gets a full ball and pumps it over long-on to seal what was an easy win in the end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! Welcome to Pune says {{BATSMAN}} to {{BOWLER}}. Pitched up delivery on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} sinks down on one knee and slogs it away over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes and the Royals are finishing on a high - {{BATSMAN}} expects {{BOWLER}} to go short and he's quick to swivel across, gets a lovely connection on the pull and sends the ball soaring over square leg - went out of the ground as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a pressure-releaser! Brings up the 50-run stand in style! {{BOWLER}} overpitches and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of it. Leans forward and sends it sailing over long-off for a gigantic six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, picks the off-cutter for treatment here -- with {{BOWLER}} insisting on feeding it short, wide, and getting sliced uppishly over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another cardinally ball-gone-wrong length. Oh at leasy give AB a challenge - for now he continues rocking behind and muscling them high over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short one angling into the gut, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and nails the pull, transfers his weight onto the backfoot, and deposits it over deep square leg for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, is that the shackle breaker? He doesn't even want to go to Karthik and punch gloves. Tells his skipper to stay put. {{BOWLER}} dishes out a slower length delivery from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and smokes it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he was undone by the lack of pace there. Early into the shot but made sure that he swung hard at this. Bruted it. And as much as it lacked the timing, it made up with its power, this shot. Clouted over deep mid-wicket, despite coming off the bottom half of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}}'s horror isn't over. Brilliant loft from {{BATSMAN}}, stepping out and timing it over extra cover. Flew into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, quickly down a knee and there's no missing about. Slogs. Holding his pose as he goes through with the swing in depositing it long and deep into cow corner. Shankar, fielding at the fence does try but ends up parrying it over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is on a roll here! Straight, length ball, {{BATSMAN}} moves leg-side and launches it straight over the bowler's head. The ball sails over the sightscreen for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short ball, and {{BATSMAN}} was ready for that - just rocks back onto the backfoot and mows that over deep mid-wicket for six! Is this the activation energy this reaction needed?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, has he cleared the fence, yes he has! Only just though! It was a flighted delivery, {{BATSMAN}} dashes down to come close to the ball, {{BOWLER}} drags his length back. And {{BATSMAN}} was not even close to the pitch he still goes through with the shot. And his audacity prevails as it clears deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, risky but much needed for {{BATSMAN}}, banged in short and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was on the back-foot, didn't get hold of the cross-batted slap, just about has enough to clear the man at long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a {{BATSMAN}} special. He loves pace, doesn't he? Stamps a 145ks delivery with a 80-metre maximum over square leg. Pure power!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, second ball and {{BATSMAN}} puts it into the stand. Gentle full delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} just extends his arms and lofts it handsomely over mid-off, the timing was such that it goes the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and another one, clean hits, but the intent should have been there earlier for DD to have a real chance. Slower ball again, {{BATSMAN}} muscles this loft over long-on. This knock will do a world of good to {{BATSMAN}}'s confidence. Meanwhile, MS was shaking his head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, terrible terrible start from {{BOWLER}}. KKR owner Shah Rukh Khan affords a smile. A high full toss well above the waist, {{BATSMAN}} somehow managed to swing it away off the top-edge and over fine leg. What a start to the over!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short ball at 131ks, angled into the body. Bring it on says {{BATSMAN}} as he swivel-pulls a 77 metre maximum over square leg.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, spots the length. It's that in-between one, and {{BATSMAN}} makes it look worse. Swivels, pulls and heaves without bothering to keep it down. All brute\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's an incredible shot from {{BATSMAN}}! Fullish ball outside off at 143.6kph, {{BATSMAN}} bends his back leg and lofts it handsomely over extra cover. Came off the meat of the bat and went all the way. Mind you, it was the longer side too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 200th six this edition. And we are just into the 11th day. Improvisation at its best. {{BATSMAN}} moves across his stumps and gets underneath the back of a length delivery, uses the pace of {{BOWLER}} and scoops it over the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's outta here. Length delivery at this venue goes only one way - onto the roads. This was right in the swinging arc for {{BATSMAN}} and he doesn't miss out, deposits it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's the bowler getting greedy with the turn on offer and offering a freebie. Way too full, the length is still acceptable, but the line is way outsi{{BATSMAN}} off stump, got to be closer to the sticks. AB just waited for it and smashed that lofted drive over extra-cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, horrible drag down this. {{BATSMAN}}'s charged down, made it into one in his slot and smoking a cross-batted heave over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fuller, wider, worse. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't need to make room, there's plenty already. Crouches low and lofts an uppish slap. Over covers, again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} ends in style and takes six. {{BOWLER}} and Rohit are disappointed. This is a fabulous shot. Even though {{BOWLER}} followed him, {{BATSMAN}} after making room outside leg, heaved that over wide long-on flat with power to clear the fence. {{TEAM}} end on 169\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short and punished! {{BOWLER}} drops it short on off, {{BATSMAN}} camps back and times his pull over mid-wicket, an impressive blow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, more of the freebies. A sitter up on the hips and {{BATSMAN}} couldn't be happier in swishing it around the corner. With all the meat in the timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 135ks doesn't matter this time! {{BOWLER}} missed his length and bowled it slightly short outside off, {{BATSMAN}} pounces on it as he sends it soaring into the long-on stands with a well-timed loft\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, too many short deliveries and MS puts one into the stands. Was getting too predictable there. Shortish in length around off, {{BATSMAN}} picks it up early and deposits a flat six over the mid-wicket fence. Sweet sound on that blow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, on one knee and spank! Right towards the pitch of the delivery and he goes kaboom over wide long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, outta here! This is what the Chepauk crowd have been waiting for more than two years - {{BATSMAN}} at his best. Tossed up on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} cleared his front leg to give himself a free swing of the arms, sends the ball sailing over the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is hugeeeeeeeee! Into the second tier! It was a bumper on the face, {{BATSMAN}} stays put and smokes it over deep backward square leg. Good bye ball! Sit back and enjoy that! We are in for a {{BATSMAN}}-storm today\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed away! Half tracker and {{BATSMAN}} is sitting back for precisely this length. Pulls it merrily into the crowd at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} tees off and oh, that's a poor effort from the fielder at long-off. Surely should have done better as he parries it away for a six. Looped up just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} got underneath it and blasted it - didn't get it off the middle but fortunately gets away. Seemed like SKY was the fielder, who made a meal of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is not the longest part at Kotla - the area behind square on the on-side. And to make things easy, it is a short ball down the leg-side. {{BATSMAN}} waits and thunders the pull well over the fence. {{BATSMAN}} is turning it on. Does not take much time to change the entire context\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh that's a full bunger on leg stump, the dew causing the ball to slip out of {{BOWLER}}'s hand. So difficult. {{BATSMAN}} swings it away over square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good use of the feet. {{BOWLER}} floats it up on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} dances down and lofts it straight back over {{BOWLER}}. The key was to play it with a straight bat and he did it with utter ease. Almost sent it into the press box\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} slowly giving Mumbai the push. He picks the off-break, shuffles across and heaves it with the spin over deep mid-wicket. Struck it flat and got the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! That has been smoked from {{BATSMAN}}. Maiden IPL fifty for him. And he is pumped, look at him celebrate. He goes down on his knees and connects it magnificently well and dispatches it over deep square leg for a maximum. Insane hitting!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, why use the feet when you have such beautiful hands. What power, woof! Gets underneath this venom-less slider and smacks it onto the roof at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, sure that time-out has helped KW. Settling into his groove now. Gets into position early and dispatches a short ball flat into the backward square stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stand and deliver stuff! {{BATSMAN}} waits for length and smokes it flat and straight back over the bowler's head with an air of arrogance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's an air-strike from {{BATSMAN}}. You cannot bowl length to {{BATSMAN}} at this stage, he gets behind it, keeps his shape and absolutely smashes it over deep mid-wicket. It went a long way back into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and this one's across the line. {{BOWLER}}'s angling it in, and that helps {{BATSMAN}}'s shot there. Swivels with the angle and plonks it all the way over deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is the best of the lot. Similar delivery to the last one and now {{BATSMAN}} goes over deep cover. Again {{BOWLER}} keeps flighting it and doesn't pull the length back too, hammered in-to-out by {{BATSMAN}}. Shows how much talent he has and why Yuvraj Singh was wowing about him when he was in KXIP\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} continues to march on. Wickets falling at one end won't make him a difference. This one is a short delivery on leg, {{BATSMAN}} keeps his calm and pulls it over fine leg, off his hips and over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the pocket rocket of Mumbai Indians is trying to squeeze maximum off the powerplay. No hanging back. Swivels into a perfect position as he pulls a leg-side filth flat into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just enough willow behind it to clear the fence. It was full and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his leg, keeps his shape and hoicks it over long-off for a maximum. Much-needed for {{TEAM}}!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you put fielders close to me, I will hit the ball out of the park. {{BATSMAN}} is taking the aggressive option. This time gets right under the ball after dancing down, smokes it straight back over {{BOWLER}} for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and now length. The cardinal length. {{BATSMAN}} rubbing it in and how. Holds his pose, lets the ball get close and clears long-off with his lofted shovel\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short of length on middle, this off-cutter from {{BOWLER}} sits up nicely to be whacked. And {{BATSMAN}} isn't one to refuse such opportunities. Belts it over the square leg boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the arc, and out of the park. You cannot expect the bowler getting away bowling length at this stage. And {{BATSMAN}} keeps up with the tradition of dishing out the punishments. Sits up and swings it through the line in tonking it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, yet again its that premeditated movement tat enables Faf to smash a big one. Transfers all his weight onto the back foot and clubs this flat over extra cover with a hint of class and elegance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this was the shot he was looking off the last ball, gets it right on this occasion. {{BOWLER}} drops it short just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes back and flat-bats it with brute power to smash it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, caps off the over with a stinker. Short ball sat up nicely for {{BATSMAN}}, he gets on top of it and nails the pull over wide long-on. Just about clears the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, much needed for the Daredevils, length ball on offer from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and clubs it over mid-wicket, went sailing over the ropes at mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, every time the spinners have dropped it short, {{BATSMAN}} has done very well to rock back, make excellent use of the crease and pull it handsomely over mid-wicket. This had a lot of hang time on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now smacks the bejeezus out of this. Gets his front leg out and hacks this ball over mid-wicket. All the way. Need drones to catch it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what about the height on this full toss? Looked like it was below the waist. This time {{BATSMAN}} makes hay. Slogs it over deep mid-wicket, where Milne is trying to catch that one-handed and leaping. Well over him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is batting of the highest quality from young {{BATSMAN}} - full and coming back into the right-hander, from that round the wicket angle - he bends low, picks the length early and slaps it over square leg for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, thumped down the ground! A googly by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} reads to perfection, treks back and bludgeons it over long-off for the second maximum of the over. Pressure on {{BOWLER}}!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, here's the shackle-breaker. {{BATSMAN}} finally middles, finally shows intent, sitting under this length and using the in-spin to slog it over deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, will this get {{BATSMAN}} going? {{TEAM}} will hope it does. {{BOWLER}} drops the slower delivery short and gives time for {{BATSMAN}} to pick his spot, pulled over deep square leg and that is the first maximum of the day\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fabulous shot! Just the extension of the arms and off she went. Good length ball just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} maintains a good base and lofts it straight back over the bowler's head. All the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whatta catch! But from one of the spectators. That went miles into the stands over cow corner. Slightly fuller length ball and the batsman knelt down to power the sweep away. Seventh six of the innings for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slotted over cow corner. {{BATSMAN}} inching closer to his ton. Another short ball, {{BATSMAN}} gets into a brilliant position and sends it a countrymile over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, comes down the track and lifts the ball away over long-on. The big hitting has spread like an epidemic. The intentions and the application was superb and in sync\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is putting on a show alright! This is what confidence can do. He's a different player now and in some mood. Gets a flattish low full toss that's sent over cow corner with a slog sweep. Such a clean hit and he stares at {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this wild heave from {{BATSMAN}} is becoming a trademark shot for him. It was short and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and hoicks it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh no! Curran has palmed it over the rope. Short and angled across the left hander, {{BATSMAN}} uses the space on offer to play the upper cut to deep backward point, Curran runs across and he is thinking of parrying the ball in even before catching it, in the end he allows it to slip past his grasp\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has arrived! Remember his knock here last year? Jumps out of his crease, shows no signs of nerves and launches {{BOWLER}} over deep extra cover with a power-packed smack on the shuffle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} doesn't get the landing rights in Mohali. The slower delivery, bowls it half-way down the pitch. Seemed as though {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for it. Rocks back and bulldozed it into the deep square leg stands. \"Catching practise for the crowd,\" says Pommie Mbangwa on air. 14th maximum for the universe boss\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is tonking them big now. That was a length ball, full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} smacks it down the ground with one knee on the ground. That sailed over long-on pretty easily\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clobbered! Bhuvi starts with a length delivery right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} with a cleared front leg swings through the line and gets plenty of distance over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 134.2kph. Plus a pitch up in the arc. So {{BATSMAN}} swings with a straight bat, with a lot of toe-end, but those muscles will do an 87-meters themselves\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dragged down short. {{BATSMAN}} is quick to pile in, rocking behind, making it look all the more worse and pulling it away, high, long, into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brilliant shot on the move. He's walking down the pitch, {{BOWLER}} does him in length with an off-cutter but {{BATSMAN}} is still able to loft him through the line over mid-off. He not only clears the infield, but the timing ensures that he clears the boundary too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh he's made up for those dot balls! A fuller length delivery with a bit of width, right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} swings through the line and runs those massive arms through it - lofts it high and mighty into the crowd in the deep extra cover region for six! Strike-rate back at 100!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, much needed six for {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}}. Also gets the crowd out of their slumber. Tosses up the leg-break and offers space for {{BATSMAN}} to free his arms, he muscles it over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, after a few sighters, {{BATSMAN}} gets into action. {{BOWLER}} lands a length ball, sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} to free his arms. Whacked elegantly over long-on. Back-to-back sixes for the Universe Boss. He's starting to tee off. Ominous signs for RR\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the idea was right from {{BOWLER}} to flight the ball to the Englishman, but when it's too full, the ball hardly has any distance to spin on the batsman. {{BATSMAN}} moves his left leg out of the way and smashes it high over the mid-wicket boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, swept away all the way over backward square leg and {{TEAM}} are running away with the game now. The heads are dropping in the DC camp. Fired down the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} meets the ball nicely and sends it into the stands, they are searching for the ball\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is not done here yet! Down on his knee and slogs it over wide long-on for half a dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Mahendra Singh {{BATSMAN}} is underway. Probably the slider down leg, {{BATSMAN}} waltzes down, gets to the pitch and wallops it wide and over the long-on rope for a maximum. Tremendous bottom hand power\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh my days! This is thrilling cricket. {{BATSMAN}} goes down low and wallops the reverse-sweep for six. He's known for this. It was right in the slot too after {{BOWLER}} flighted it up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} knows what's coming. A slower delivery, he transfers all his weight onto the back foot and bullies the ball over cow-corner. All power!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and boom! That has gone into the orbit. Charged out and muscled it over deep mid for a sixer. Huge hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, outrageous hit from {{BATSMAN}}! Pacy short of a length ball and he was hanging back, smokes the flat-batted hit high and handsome over the long-on fence. Shot!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is looking in fine touch. Sees a short ball, backs away and gets under it to smoke it over deep backward square leg stands. Into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, boom! Finally, {{BATSMAN}} swings his bat and connects, connects big. Sees a flighted delivery, just outside off and takes it head-on. Strong muscles and biffs it a long way over the stands at long-on. Wears a cheeky smile on his face\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely shot! This is {{BATSMAN}} Sharma we all know. Flighted on off, he makes a bit of room to go inside out and connects handsomely, the ball crosses the boundary cushion by a metre or so\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, that should get {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}} off and running, a friendly length ball on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he picked it up, used {{BOWLER}}'s pace and clipped it high and behind square on the on-side, went a long way over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act. He's had enough. Uses his feet, reaches near the pitch and tonks it over long-off. An 84-meter strike\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, up, up and over long-on. {{BATSMAN}} has seen enough and it's time to get into business. Slightly bends forward, reaches out with his long levers as he pummels it high and sends it over the ropes. There was a fielder waiting but it cleared him. First shot of real intent and it's a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this time he connects well. Flighted delivery outside off stump, not as wide as the previous one. {{BATSMAN}} goes straight down the ground and clears the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over a leaping McCullum at long-off. Short of length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} flat-bats it straight back over {{BOWLER}}, McCullum standing at straightish long-off, jumps up and couldn't even get a finger\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how often has he done that? Makes six hitting so simple, does {{BATSMAN}}. Wonder why he wasn't sent to open the innings. This was a short delivery and the all-rounder simply pulled it over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, disappears into the crowd. Slanted in on leg from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} lowers himself to get under the ball and swings it backward of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, MAAMMAAMIAAAHHH! That has sailed over the long-off region. Out of nowhere, Mr. 360 {{BATSMAN}}ci{{BATSMAN}}s to pepper the area down the ground and he got the length to smack it down the ground. Length to ABD is blasphemous\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, easy peasy! Just a short-arm jab and the ball clears the rope. {{BOWLER}} rolls his fingers across the ball and bowls it on a length, {{BATSMAN}} smokes it over deep mid-wicket nonchalantly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, deep into the crowd! {{BATSMAN}} has activated the beast mode, danger signs for RCB if they don't get him quickly. Back of a length around middle and off, {{BATSMAN}} sat on the back foot and smoked it way over deep mid-wicket. Huge biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, even better! Short ball that sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} to play the pull shot. He is a short man, but isn't afraid to play shots like that. Pummels it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} bangs it in short, {{BATSMAN}} once again cleared his front leg to pummel the pull. Didn't quite middle it, got it off the top part of the bat. But, he swung his bat so ferociously that it went all the way over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, they have made up for Bumrah's over. {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track, takes it on the full and the rest was easy, he uses a clean bat swing to clear long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, swings through the line of that half-volley and connects! Angles it in towards the leg and middle-stumps, right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} clears the front-leg a little and brings those massive forearms into play - goes right through the line, beautiful head position, and deposits that over the long-on fence for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Wankhede is coming unglued here. The stadium is rocking for {{BATSMAN}}. Low full toss, he's heaved it over deep mid-wicket, just over the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, against the turn and run of play. Leg-spinner and {{BATSMAN}} steps down, keeps himself away from the pitch of the ball, swings hard and sends it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, crack! That was the sound when ball made contact with the bat. A gift from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll, full toss on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} swings hard and dispatches it over deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the air and goes all the way! The man in the deep was interested, but the ball goes well over his head. The bouncer from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} was hurried by the pace. Still goes with the pull shot and gets a fat top-edge. Had enough wood to clear deep backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, some turn on this leg break but {{BATSMAN}} stays put and swipes this over deep mid-wicket. Just a little short, which allowed {{BATSMAN}} to go against the spin there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there he goes, and clears the roof! Signature {{BATSMAN}} this. So good with the pull shot against spin. Even deliveries that are slightly off in length, he pounces on them. This one, though, is a proper long hop and {{BATSMAN}} just nails it over square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, this should give plenty of confidence for {{BATSMAN}}, on a good length and well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out, plays with an open face and slices it high and over cover, has enough to clear the ropes on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, that's one way to greet the leg-spinner, {{BATSMAN}} backed away, lost his bottom hand but still has enough power to send the swipe high and over long-off for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, the pep talk has worked, {{BATSMAN}} dances down the track, gets close to the ball, lets the ball turn and then clouts it high and over deep mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's not over yet. {{BATSMAN}} has pumped this full toss over the ropes. {{BOWLER}} misses the blockhole, and disappears over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, parried over. {{BATSMAN}} has been sent above to do this. Goes for the slog sweep and hits it to deep backward square, Rutherford is running back to take the catch but he could only palm it over. The momentum did not help him there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Faf now rubs more salt into the bleeding wounds of {{BOWLER}}. Shuffles across and shovels the ball away over fine leg for a sixer. Pretty much like the last game here, there is a lot of carry\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now you know why he has been promoted up the order. Picks the length early on this short one and slaughters it over the long-on for an impressive six. Was middled to perfection as it went deep into the stands. Held the pose for the cameras too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, kaboooooom! He's got this off the meat, that's for sure. Fractionally short from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't even bother to go on the back foot. Was on the initial forward trigger and picks up the pull with ease. Into the shorter boundary at deep square leg for a biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, first ball and it is out of the park. Length delivery right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} crouches a bit and tonks it over deep mid-wicket. Plenty of height and the required distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, second six of the over. Again it is {{BATSMAN}} who is doing the damage. Rushed out and clouted the slower delivery high and long. Hardik at long-off tried his best, leaping with one hand to his right, but the ball was always winning that battle. Just over him and six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, welcome to the attack Mr.{{BOWLER}}! {{BATSMAN}} is absolutely nonchalant as he dispatches this rubbish short ball way into the stands at deep backward square leg. At his pace, {{BOWLER}} needs to be careful about the lengths he bowls, especially in the Powerplay\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, boy, has he nailed it! You bet. 95-metre smite. {{BOWLER}} serves length and gets smoked for a maximum over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that has been flat-batted with a lot of sinewy power! The short ball angled across and {{BATSMAN}} thwarted it down the ground despite not connecting it with the meat of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, more insult -- off a slice this time, over long-off. Neat bat swing, and a flat tonk\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 111.4kph. Picks the slower one, picks his slot and picks the maximum. His hands were always swinging, with the legs going away and making the space to -- in lofting it way over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and the new bat brings the result straightaway. Picks out the googly, sits on one knee and smokes it into the second tier over the long-on fence. Can't be that full to {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is one of the best players of spin in the country and here's the testament. {{BOWLER}} gives more air, overpitches in the process and {{BATSMAN}} frees his arms to thawart it straight down the ground for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, excellent finish to the over. Three dots and still it is a 11-run over. {{BOWLER}} goes searching for the yorker and bowls a juicy full toss, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and helps it over short fine with a lap. A ball-boy takes a well judged catch outside the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, take that! Short of a length delivery on the off stump, {{BATSMAN}} shows no respect and pulls the ball handsomely over mid-wicket. Brilliant hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's more like it! Goes down on his knee and hacks the floated delivery over deep backward square leg for half a dozen does the {{TEAM}} skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, as soon as he saw the tossed up delivery, a chinaman, {{BATSMAN}} goes downtown. Kneels down and then slogs it miles back into the long-on stands. That's what {{BATSMAN}} can do\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, {{BATSMAN}} is making the CSK captain think - length ball outside off and he lifted it nonchalantly over the head of the fielder at mid-off - the timing is sweet and the ball sailed over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the air for an eternity and it's also cleared the ropes! Not a bad hit from a lower order batsman. Fuller length from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} lifts it high down the ground. Plenty of elevation and just about has the distance to clear long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another biggie and {{BATSMAN}} has deposited this one into the top tier of Kotla. {{BOWLER}} gave this one plenty of air, {{BATSMAN}} gets a big stride forward and dismisses it high and over long-on. He's looking extremely dangerous\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, one-handed six for {{BATSMAN}}. Tossed it up on off, {{BATSMAN}} used his reach to get to the ball and just went through with the loft, the bottom hand comes off and the ball sails over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a one-handed six now, how do you bowl to this man? On a good length and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was looking to swipe it towards the on-side, his bottom hand came off at the point of impact, but it still had enough power to sail into the crowd at wide long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wrong length from {{BOWLER}}. The off-cutter is landed short of length, sat up for {{BATSMAN}}, who gave it his all to smash the pull over mid-wicket, the in-form batsman has broken the shackles for the home side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, scorching stroke! {{BATSMAN}} is going bonkers here. Expecting the shorter length and makes room before launching it over wide long-off. There was a fielder there but this was wider and higher as well. Back to back biggies for the skipper. He is having a ball on captaincy debut\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another slower {{BATSMAN}}livery and another six. Predictable from {{BOWLER}}. Again {{BATSMAN}} stays so still, doesn't move around at all, over long-on now. Clean and beautiful\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is buffet for {{BATSMAN}}. Couple of steps down and takes it on the full, then heaves it a long way over the cow corner fence. Second six of the over and {{BOWLER}} is under pressure\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a biggie to end the over! Excellent timing on that. Full and floated on middle, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out on the chance to slog it over mid-wicket, a meaty blow that was. That'll spoil the over for the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a price to pay. Slower ball again, {{BATSMAN}} picks it up and mauls the free-hit ball over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, drifts it on leg-stump and that's been handsomely picked up over long leg. Cross-seamed and skidding on, so {{BATSMAN}} had the pace to work with\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is the best of the lot. Similar delivery to the last one and now {{BATSMAN}} goes over deep cover. Again {{BOWLER}} keeps flighting it and doesn't pull the length back too, hammered in-to-out by {{BATSMAN}}. Shows how much talent he has and why Yuvraj Singh was wowing about him when he was in KXIP\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length ball in the slot for {{BATSMAN}}, he stands rooted to the crease and powers it into the cow corner orbit with tremendous timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 17 off the over with two balls to go! In the slot and {{BATSMAN}} has smoked it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, off the mark for six. Again tossed up on leg, {{BATSMAN}} this time slog-sweeps and hits it way back over the stands at deep backward square. The crowd getting catching practice\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and look at how {{BATSMAN}} celebrates Stokes no-bullseye last ball. Gets the right length to smack his bat right across to, and does so effectively. Hedgehopped over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes and now we know why GG was relcutant to bowl the spinners at the death. Length delivery right in the swinging arc, {{BATSMAN}} is known for his big-hittin and he thumps this over the cow corner fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! Bowls length and gets punished. On the pads and just a flick of the wrists. The ball has more than enough wings to clear the square leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, into the clouds. Too good for the multi-pixel cameras to pick this one from the clouds as well. Too short this from {{BOWLER}}, all the time for {{BATSMAN}} to rock back, inherit the line and plunder it away. Hacked away to clear the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that ball stayed up for an eternity. The fielder at long-on thought he was in with a chance, but it is Chris {{BATSMAN}} who is batting and even a miscue from him will clear the rope. Went after the wrong 'un and cue-ended the loft, just about managed to clear the field\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} being taken to the cleaners. That is the fourth six {{BATSMAN}} has struck off {{BOWLER}}. Half tracker on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} transfers his weight back and deposits the pull over deep backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, nothing half-hearted about this. Picked the length (short) early and deposited this over wide long-on with an air of nonchalance. Typical {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! What a shot! A great chance for {{BATSMAN}} to knock a few in the middle and prepare for the remaining games. Short of a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} pulls over mid-wicket and clears quite comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back of a length delivery just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} simply clears the front leg and belts it over wide long-on to bring up his half-century. He just knows how to turn on in these run-chases\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} welcomes {{BOWLER}} with a maximum. A loopy delivery around off and the shouthpaw has lofted it over wide long-off with impeccable timing, looked a six the moment he connnected that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 50 up already for {{TEAM}}. In the slot and {{BATSMAN}} clears his front foot to nail this straight over the bowler's head. Into the second tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, glorious shot! And that's gone all the way. Wow. Fuller ball and {{BOWLER}} got it swing away in the air. Doesn't bother {{BATSMAN}}, who walked forward, crouched low and elevated it over extra cover. Off the meat of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this guy can hit it a long way. Yep, {{BATSMAN}} is turning it on here at the Chinnaswamy. Once again, too full from Piyush {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} clears his left leg and deposits it over long-on with a mighty lofted on-drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a way to bring up the century partnership. NCN went short with this slower delivery, but {{BATSMAN}} got the placement right. There was a man at deep mid-wicket and it went at a catchable height, but he hit it to his right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, huuuuge! Mohammed {{BOWLER}} bowls a fullish ball, {{BATSMAN}} stays deep in the crease and it ends up right in his slot. Gets underneath it and massacres it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, even he gets punished. Tries to bowl a yorker but ends up bowling a half-volley. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out and deposits it over mid-wicket. Way into the stands as {{BATSMAN}} moves on to 86*\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} launches {{BOWLER}} over long-off. Was right in the slot to play the lofted drive, hit it cleanly and went all the way. {{BOWLER}} came round the wicket and bowled a loosener, paid the price\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is {{BATSMAN}} at his best. He does this so often against spinners. Dances down, gets to the pitch of the delivery and takes {{BOWLER}} for a journey over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, why on earth did they remove Rabada after that brilliant over? {{BATSMAN}} was never comfortable against him. This Delhi team does strange things! {{BOWLER}} serves up a length ball on the leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} is good when he connects those slogs and he has done decently well this time, flew over wide mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full, tossed up wide outside off and drop-kicked with all the non-chalance in the world. The long-on area peppered this time. The length allowed the batsman to get under the ball and send it on a journey\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, third six off the over! In the same area again. It was very full and on the leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and launches it over long-off again. Into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this will do. Sinks low, gets under this slower ball and tonks it over the long-on fence for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, caught by Shikhar Dhawan but goes over the rope. Six more. {{BATSMAN}} powered this flat and over the head of Dhawan at long-on, he caught it well but went one step back and trod on the cushion. Still manages a wry smile and a \"ooooohhhhhhh\"\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}}, pushed through flatter and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and thumps it flat and hard over mid-wicket, went sailing over the ropes for another maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another {{BOWLER}}. Another dispatch. Right in the slot. A shimmy across from {{BATSMAN}} to top it up with a full-blooded tonk. Several rows into the long-on stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} greets {{BOWLER}} with a maximum! That's gone outta here. Flat, non-turner on a length, {{BATSMAN}} gets down on one knee and nails the slog sweep to send it over deep square leg. New ball please!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh my! {{BATSMAN}} has got the best possible start to the over. {{BOWLER}} does not have the pace to bowl short and it sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}}, who swivels across and sends the pull soaring over the long leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is dealing in sixes! A short ball by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back in the crease and pulls it over deep mid-wicket for six more. Just the momentum they were looking for!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh just a touch overpitched. And so overpitched that the change of pace doesn't matter much. And to make things worse, {{BATSMAN}} had read it. So waits a little longer and dumps the ball over long-off. More timing than anything else. Connected the ball at the right time and boom, you can hit it with a spoon too. Well, not really. 20 off 24 needed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has arrived and how! Latches on to this length {{BATSMAN}}livery, holds his shape and whacks it over {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket for half-a-dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's one length you don't bowl to {{BATSMAN}}. He thrives with anything short, the round the wicket angle was also taking it down leg, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and helps along the way over fine leg. With the fielder inside the ring it was more comfortable to put it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, we're into the mode of having fun now. A wide yorker gone wrong. Shortened by a few inches and {{BATSMAN}} just leans low, crouches and whacks it down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hat-trick of sixes, RJ is under the pump here at the Eden - tossed up on off, {{BATSMAN}} came down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it high and over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, floated up on a fuller length and {{BATSMAN}} says thank you very much. A much needed six for {{TEAM}}. {{BATSMAN}} plonks his front foot forward and hammers the loft with the turn over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, right in {{BATSMAN}}'s teeing off zone. Picks the slower delivery and murders it over long-on. As easy as you like\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shortens his length and keeps it around off, {{BATSMAN}} stays on the back foot and thrashes it way over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 137.4kph, shortish ball that sits up nicely. Having already shuffled across, {{BATSMAN}} waited for the ball to come to him. A pivot across, followed by a fierce pull over deep mid-wicket. That's mighty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} power for you! It was on a length and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} stays in the crease and smashes it over long-on with utter disdain for a maximum. Hardik Pandya at the non striker's end loved it too!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, superb batting. {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across, goes down on his knee and waits for the low full toss, then nonchalantly helps it over backward square. The connection was so good that the ball sailed over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there's the first maximum for the evening. {{BATSMAN}} cuts loose, gets the required length to swing his arms and clouts it way back into the cow corner stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slower ball again but this time {{BATSMAN}} hacks it over deep mid-wicket. It was slightly closer to off-stump and was given a fair tonk\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's raining fours and sixes here at the Eden Gardens. {{BOWLER}} is being taken to the cleaners. Looped up just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and blasts it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, unfurl the noise now! Slammed down the ground over long-off. Well flighted ball and the batsman spanks it over the fence. He ain't holding back. {{TEAM}} are unstoppable\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now that is some shot! Kohli hit a six over long-off in an international game and this is a little similar to that. Not easy to loft handsomely off the back foot and he did so without balance too. Great shot!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, skips out of his crease and smokes a dart high into the night sky, straight back over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now this has been crunched. Short of length into the body, 147kph, {{BATSMAN}} treats it with contempt as he pulls over midwicket. Skimmer!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! That's some shot. Just a chip from {{BATSMAN}} and the ball has cleared the rope. It was the slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} was deceived for a moment there, checks his loft and manages to time it beautifully, goes all the way straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that slow-and-wide plan to KW from {{BOWLER}} was better. Drifts this in and is slog-swept by KW over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, don't think Bhuvi has been treated in such a way this season by anyone. He's under the pump! Bowls a short one around off, {{BATSMAN}} transfers his weight on to the back foot and pulls it for a clean six over fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautiful flick that. Very less margin for error on this wicket. Full on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} keeps his eyes on the ball and flicks it over mid-wicket with nonchalance. Made that shot look effortless\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} sends it into the crowd. It was a short of length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, makes room, makes excellent use of good bounce and powers it over deep backward point for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the pocket-rocket launches his missile. Saw what was coming maybe, picks the knuckle ball by advancing down the track and deposits over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this guy can hit it a long way. Yep, {{BATSMAN}} is turning it on here at the Chinnaswamy. Once again, too full from Piyush {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} clears his left leg and deposits it over long-on with a mighty lofted on-drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this game is so unkind to the bowlers. {{BOWLER}} has actually deceived the batsman in flight and with length, {{BATSMAN}}, who was jumping out of the crease was nowhere close to the pitch of the ball, but he's gifted with timing and has a great willow in his hands and that combo is good enough for him to back himself and go through with the lofted hit over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a monster! Dhoni-esque. Flat, quick and overpitched, right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} to swing his bat. Clears his front leg and tonks it over long-on for a gigantic six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} brings up his fifty in style! Latches on to the short ball and smokes it over long-on for a massive six. His 8th IPL fifty, this is insane!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cruel game this! {{BOWLER}} bowls this one right into the slot on off and {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knee and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for six more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the Hitman has arrived. Not for the first time has {{BOWLER}} been at the receiving end of such brilliance by {{BATSMAN}}. Remember that six over extra cover Down Under? Hangs back in his crease, stands tall and thwacks the short ball over deep mid-wicket for half-a-dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's smoked that away, Jaddu! This is the second time he's hit a big shot despite being off balance. Slower delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} somehow connects and gets enough power to clear long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 16 runs off the first three balls. This is the best of the lot. Good length ball on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} just picks it up nonchalantly and places it into the stands at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, game over. {{BOWLER}} tries the slower one, but {{BATSMAN}} - in some mood - picks it early and nails it right off the screws, over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}, short and at his body, he gets inside the line, uses the pace on the ball and helps it way over the ropes at long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he means business today! Showing no mercy on the young bowlers. Loopy delivery on off, touch fuller and it has been smoked over long-off for half-a-dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cameras pan to {{BOWLER}}'s face and he's clueless at the monstrosity of his home venue. Slow ball angles across, but {{BATSMAN}}'s dispatched him over deep mid-wicket first ball. Is there a pitch in the pavilion?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a wonderful shot! Was darted in by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} spotted it quickly. Got down on a knee and slogged it over deep mid-wicket with a sweep shot. Off she goes into the stands and thereby silencing the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short of length {{BATSMAN}}livery wi{{BATSMAN}} of off, punished by {{BATSMAN}} who slaps it over extra cover. Turning out to be a great over for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, decides to launch {{BOWLER}} over mid-off. Waited in his crease, picked this fuller length delivery early and muscled it over mid-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shot! {{BATSMAN}} gets down on a knee and slogs this length ball over the deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, third short ball in a row and {{BATSMAN}} punishes it with ease. No venom on this occasion, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and hacked it comfortably into the fine leg stands. First maximum of the innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ahhhh, this is vintage {{BATSMAN}}! Back of a length around middle and leg, easy for him as he swivels just a touch before drop kicking this over deep fine leg. Easy pickings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 120kph slower short of length delivery, sat up nicely for {{BATSMAN}}, who pulls it off the front foot, struck it flat and over the wide long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, I reckon {{TEAM}} got the better trade - after they let Dhawan go, picked the wrong 'un, went down low and swipes it it high and over square leg for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! This is a big over for {{TEAM}}. Second six and 17 has come off it. {{BOWLER}} fails to nail the yorker, misses it by an inch and {{BATSMAN}} makes him pay. Gets under it and dumps it over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, awful from {{BOWLER}}. Cannot bowl short with third man inside the ring. {{BATSMAN}} knew the fielder was in, so went back and ramped it over short third man. Such is the timing that it went all the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's mowed that over deep mid-wicket. Back of a length, maybe a cutter, and it sits up to be whacked. Flat six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, going, going and gone! One of the cleanest strikes of the afternoon. {{BATSMAN}} puts on his dancing shoes and lofts it over long-on for a towering six. Could have been a maximum on any ground, anywhere in the world\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, okay, he's catching up. {{BOWLER}}' no Nortje, and these 130ks are dibbly-dobblers for {{BATSMAN}}, who's clearing out his front leg and heaving it into those conical sheds at cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, THWACK! MS {{BATSMAN}} in the final over is a sight to behold! Slams this short ball, pulling it over deep square leg for third successive six. That's a joint IPL record - 33 sixes in a game...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} misses the mark and pays the price. {{BATSMAN}} dances across his sticks, exposes all of it and picks the ball over fine leg for a sixer. That was smart, not from the bowler though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smokedddddddd! Can't bowl short to {{BATSMAN}}, he'll have you for breakfast and dinner all day long. Clears his front leg and clobbers the pull over deep mid-wicket. Made a cracking sound off the blade\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} shouted \"catch it\" and there was no way anyone could have caught that. The South African goes a tad fuller in his length and that enables {{BATSMAN}} to get underneath it, slams it flat and over long-off for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bring it on! Make a GIF of that shot. {{BATSMAN}} swapped his hands and belted it with switch hit over third man, that's some hitting I tellya. Got behind it and gave it a full whack, bam!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely shot, tossed up invitingly by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} gets a big stride forward and lifts it through the line, long-on is just a spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a six to begin with! Can't bowl in the slot to a rampaging {{BATSMAN}}, you just can't. Just lifts it down the ground, this is another mishit that clears long-off comfortably. How does he hit these mistimed shots for six? Insane!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 150 up for Mumbai and that too in style. {{BATSMAN}} latches on to the slower delivery, right into the slot and it's been muscled over the long-on fence, huge six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, naahhh! {{BATSMAN}} ain't showing any mercy. Tonks it over long-off. Served it up slower and wider of off, {{BATSMAN}}'s long levers coming to the fore.. sends it into the empty stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dropped too short - it's the scarred scared bowling - and {{BATSMAN}} piles on with a rock behind, a front-leg clear and a heave into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, kneels down and lifts the ball away! That wasn't too far away from Rashid at the boundary line. The ball pops over the fence as well. Much needed sixer for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, had it gone a few inches higher, it would have gone past the reach of earth's gravity. Short ball and {{BATSMAN}} gets late on the pull, top edges it over the keeper's head. Goes deep into the stands as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is the advantage of having the ability to play the switch-hit. You can't set fields for such shots. A good flighted delivery on the stumps, nothing wrong with the delivery, {{BATSMAN}} makes decent connection, although it was a top edge and it cleared the rope over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, excellent shot! Moves inside the line, swings hard and towers it right over the bowler's head for a maximum. He's looking in good touch today\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massacred over wide long-on. Again those hands. Down the track and then helicoptered miles into the crowd. The {{TEAM}} crowd are sent into pangs of uncontrolled emotion. They are going wild\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he wants to finish this early. He is just a hit away from a hundred now. Back of a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} pulls and clears deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, well, well, well, it can get cleaner. {{BOWLER}}'s darted this bang into the arc, {{BATSMAN}}'s down on a knee too and goes slogging. If only boundaries were in the second tier!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how has {{BATSMAN}} got that for six? Unbelievable wrists. Down the track and not to the pitch of this length delivery, but he trusts himself and then whips it in the air, Evin Lewis was the man circling under that at deep mid, but it kept sailing over him and then flies over the fence. Stunning batting by {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! This is brutal hitting from {{BATSMAN}}. Third six off the over. Again {{BOWLER}} hurls it quick and in the arc for {{BATSMAN}}, who waits deep in his crease and tonks it over long-off. \"Merciless\" is the word which pops up on the giant screen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's a good striker of the cricket ball and {{BOWLER}} erred in his length. Too full and allowed the batsman to get under the ball, {{BATSMAN}} was down on one knee to smash it over the leaping long-on fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed! A sharp bouncer @139.8km/h, {{BATSMAN}} isn't back and across, but natural talent comes to the fore - the frontfoot across and that pulled high in front of deep square leg for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Watto is off to a flier. Although he has been dropped twice, he's continuing to take on the bowlers. This was a length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} stood tall and clobbered it over the extra cover fence for half a dozen more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the previous over Russell was striking 'em big, it's {{BATSMAN}} in this one. A juicy full toss around off and {{BATSMAN}} has hacked it over deep mid-wicket for another towering six. He's asking for a waist-high no ball but replays confirm it wasn't one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finally! Too many slower deliveries, one had to go big. {{BATSMAN}} picks it up nicely and deposits it well over the mid-wicket fence. First one of the night for MS\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh that's gone a loooong way into the stands. Stand and deliver stuff! Full and in the slot, {{BOWLER}} goes for the yorker, misses the yorker by some mark and {{BATSMAN}} gets under it to send it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, loosener from {{BOWLER}} and he has been dispatched into the empty stands. Back of length angling into leg, {{BATSMAN}} loves it there, picks it up nonchalantly and sends it sailing over backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the cross-seaming sit up. {{BOWLER}} stays in the slot, and {{BATSMAN}} stays tonking. Holds his pose, doesn't over-hit, and still manages to loft it all the way over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, \"Will he catch it? Yes, he will! No, he won't!\", yelps Mbangwa on-air! Good effort by long-off but too difficult in the end. Pandey was the man there, leapt to take it one-handed but the momentum was taking him past the ropes and in the effort to throw it back into play, fails to do so. Floated ball and was lofted down the ground by Karun, gets a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is a jail-break from {{BATSMAN}}! Retaliation from the batter as he camped back to smoke a sixer over deep mid. That was gargantuan from the young man and 61 is needed now. {{TEAM}}, more importantly {{BATSMAN}}, needed that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, too full on off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} picks the flight and sits on one knee to dispatch it for a 75-metre maximum over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act now. {{BOWLER}} is being taken to the cleaners. Slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} spotted it early, lined himself for the big hit and smacked it straight back over the bowler, just clearing the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, uh oh. I will. I have. {{BATSMAN}} gets a six here. Wanted to do this since the first ball of this over but gets the desired length and pace on this ball. Outside off, just short enough and he's slogged this over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whoa! {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act. Read the knuckle ball from {{BOWLER}}, it was full in the arc for {{BATSMAN}}. He just extended his arms and lofted with a clean swing of the bat over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's gone deep into the crowd! Best over of the chase thus far and {{TEAM}} needed this to be fair. {{BOWLER}} is under pressure now. Full and flat just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} fetches it with a slog sweep over deep mid-wicket. Meaty blow!\n",
            "{{BATSMAN}} {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short ball, same result. This time off the back foot. The batsman waited on this and hammered the pull over cow corner for a maximum. That just went over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's why he eats those dots. He knows he can make up for it big time. Flighted delivery on the leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} gets down on one knee and slog-sweeps it from the middle of the bat over square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another one! Bam bam! He reaches his highest T20 score and does it in some style. Greyhounds down the pitch and takes {{BOWLER}} for a journey over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this was in the air for a long time, for a second the fielder at deep square leg looked in business but the breeze here in Mohali takes it away over the ropes. Probably, Archer - the fielder - was standing a few yards inside the rope, had he been near the boundary, he would've had a better chance of catching it. Big misjudgement from him there as {{BATSMAN}} gets away. It was banged in short, {{BATSMAN}} after a few sighters takes it on and pulls. Didn't time it as he would've liked but luckily, the ball sails over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the airrr and just clears a leaping Rohit. A handy six for {{BATSMAN}} and Punjab. Pitched up just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} went through with the loft with a clean swing of the bat, enough wings on it to take it over the ropes at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you miss the length, you will get punished. The idea was good from Kumar, but the execution was horrible. Fullish outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his weight across and bullies it over extra cover. A flat six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the explosion does not seem to stop. {{TEAM}} keep steamrolling. {{BATSMAN}} uses his feet to the flighted delivery and lofts it beautifully over the long-off. Who said he can't play spin?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, too short from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} often doesn't let them go unpunished. This was the slower short ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} spotted it early, stayed back and pulled it over mid-wicket, went a long way into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, second time {{TEAM}} have hit a maximum right after the time out. Back of a length delivery and on a slow surface it was a hit-me ball, Mo swivels back and nails the pull flat over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, first maximum of the 2019 IPL! It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knees and nails the slog sweep over deep mid-wicket for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, okay, {{BATSMAN}} has decided to change gears and he's targeting {{BOWLER}}. Again gets the length up, {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for this. Just gets under it and muscles it a mile over deep mid-wicket. Second six of the over, pressure on the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, thumped down the ground! {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the wicket, converts it into a half volley and lofts it right over the bowler's head. Couldn't have hit a better shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the most powerful delivery boy is here. He has sent it packing over the cow corner region. Brutal sinews into that pull and the ball flies away into oblivion\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}}, came charging down the track, {{BOWLER}} went full and wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} was committed to the drive, gets it off the outside half and still has enough to sail over the ropes - at deep backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clears the front leg to a googly that was right in his slot and lofts it through the line over long-on. Clean strike from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is finding his bearings now. {{BOWLER}} errs in length and dishes out a full ball right in the hitting zone, {{BATSMAN}} frees his arms and launches it straight down the ground, pings the sightscreen on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, not middled but {{BATSMAN}} will take it. He loves facing the spinners. Bit of air given by {{BOWLER}} and that is enough for {{BATSMAN}} to get underneath it, sliced the on-drive over the wide long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, misses the yorker again, this time {{BOWLER}}, and {{BATSMAN}} has hammered it over {{BATSMAN}}ep square leg for a big six. Sized up for a length ball and got a full toss to scream it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, advances, gets right to the pitch of the delivery and hacks him over wide long-on. Nailed!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, got to feel for the bowlers who are forced to bowl a defensive line with these big bats and small boundaries. Can cricket be kind on them please? {{BOWLER}} did the right thing by spinning the ball away from {{BATSMAN}} and bowling wide outside off stump, but he bowled too full and the big man got under it to smash it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, first of all, kudos to the cameraman for following that one. Half-volley on middle, in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} lofts it with every ounce of his power straight down the ground for six. That went through to the stratosphere and back into the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he goes and goes big. What helps him the sensible approach - that is to go with the turn. Clubs over cow corner for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, piles on his luck. Unleashes the first boundary of the day clearing his front leg, walking into the line and down in executing the full bat swing as he clinically dispatches it with a tonk over long-on. All timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} brings up the 200 in style. {{BOWLER}} misses his yorker by a long distance, this was right in the swinging arc, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and pumps it into the first tier near long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slower ball, he has picked it again does {{BATSMAN}}. Not quite off the middle, but he will take it, a 83-metre maximum. Doesn't make any shuffly movements, just keeps his head still and spanks the ball as hard as he can, into the long-off stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} goes one step better compared to his mate. That has been drop-kicked over {{BOWLER}}ep square for a maximum. The runs are raining now. RCB ducking for cover but no where to hi{{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fine slog-sweep. Nails it from the meat of the bat. Knelt down and timed it well enough to clear Cutting at deep mid. Who watches the ball sail over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's straight into the RCB dug-out, the yorker strategy lasted one ball, {{BOWLER}} drops this one an inch short, allows {{BATSMAN}} to get under it and thump it over Hetmyer's head at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another six. Length ball, around off and {{BATSMAN}} has swung it over deep square leg. It's that sort of a day. 18 sixes already\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a way to bring up the hundred partnership! Dropped short, a rank half-tracker, {{BATSMAN}} uses the depth of the crease, rocks back, and throws his entire weight behind that pull over cow corner for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Faf {{BATSMAN}}, you champion! He takes just one ball to do it. Slower ball on a length, whacks it back down the ground to smash those LED boards before raising his arms and letting out a huge roar\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smacked away! Takes full toll of the extra delivery, does {{BATSMAN}}. Full and in the slot for him, he just hacks it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. DD needed that badly, they certainly did\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's got proper hold of that. Good lord. That's gone way back. Not much different than the first delivery as {{BATSMAN}} lunges at a length ball but this time he muscles it right off the middle. Welcome back as an opener\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 21 off the over and the asking rate has come down to 7.4. {{TEAM}} are surely the favourites now. The inexperienced {{BOWLER}} bangs one short, but slightly errs in line. Leg-stumpish and {{BATSMAN}} takes heavy toll of it. Walks across and helps it along its way with a hook over fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's {{BATSMAN}} time at the Chinnaswamy. The decibels have got a notch higher. Treks back and pulls the short ball over deep mid-wicket. Two in two for the skipper as the ball just clears the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the second tier tonks have become boring. So AB goes into the third. Once that front leg goes out of the way, it's always into the orbit. And then the ball's on the meaty length too. Whacked, straight down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, excellent shot to get off the mark. He's in sublime touch, has carried his form into this match too. On a length outside off, stands tall and pumps that over covers for half a dozen. Flat and over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} gets going in some style, his first runs of IPL and it's a huge six, length ball on his pads, he swivelled across and helped it on its way, deep into the second tier at long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed! Right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} - full and angled into the pads, he had ma{{BATSMAN}} room and then his arms came down at a great speed to send the ball sailing over {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's been hit to the ESA kids in the stands. Brings up Mumbai's fastest fifty in IPL. Dragged down from round the wicket, left-handed {{BATSMAN}} goes back and clouts it over deep mid-wicket. It was a pull but more casually ruthless\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! That is a top shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Flighted outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends low and gets under the ball, chips it with the spin over extra cover and the timing is such that it clears the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smoked into the second tier. No respite for {{BOWLER}}. After an expensive first over, here he is hoping to quietly start a new spell. But {{BATSMAN}} catches him at the door. Swipes him away over midwicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a hit-me {{BATSMAN}}livery and {{BATSMAN}} bludgeons it. Half tracker and {{BATSMAN}} picked his spot - {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket and sends the ball sailing into the crowd with a pull shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the googly again, but it's way too short. {{BATSMAN}} jumps on the back foot, times the pull well enough to send it high in the air and over the mid-wicket boundary. A poor over that from {{BOWLER}}, bowled well to Raina, but was very poor with his length to {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, half-tracker and gone! Lovely swivel-pull from {{BATSMAN}}, lands {{BOWLER}} over the mid-wicket fence, brute power!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shot! One of best shots played today. The {{TEAM}} skipper gives the charge by coming down the track and then offers a straight bat to thump this length ball over long-on. Off the middle and off she goes into the stands. Poses for the photographs too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clubbed over long-on! The home crowd were extremely hopeful that it would carry to the fielder but it's cleared him comfortably. Rare bad ball from {{BOWLER}} who gives one in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} who doesn't try to overhit it. Just a clean bat swing to send it over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} does clear the boundary rope at deep mid-wicket. This a half tracker and those bulging forearms come into play, he muscles it way over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that would have been applauded at the Flushing Meadows! That was a superb forehand down the ground. Powered over long-on. Flat and muscular\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wide and slotted over covers. And it wasn't a bad ball from {{BOWLER}}, drifting it wide and making {{BATSMAN}} reach out. But erred in the length and paid by six runs. That's it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes, this is {{BATSMAN}}'s highest ever T20 score. {{BOWLER}} isn't learning here, another length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and lifts it high and over long-on, went a long way over the ropes at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and he's got the distance. It was in the air for a long time but he had made enough connection to beat deep mid-wicket. Slower short of length delivery and it sat up nicely, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and heaves it with a clean bat swing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and now he lets the off-side take the brunt. Patel in his response fires one out flat and wide. The mind-reader that {{BATSMAN}} is, sinks and tonks it through the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wowww! What a start. This is the very venue where {{BATSMAN}} grabbed eyeballs during a champions league T20 game against New South Wales back in 2009. Looks like he's going to counterattack. Flighted delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} muscles it high over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, top-edges are the new first aid in cricket. Didn't {{TEAM}} need that. A back of a length delivery going down leg-side, DK was late on the slog-sweep and ushered a top-edge over fine leg. It was way into the crowd, trust me\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, terrific striking from {{BATSMAN}}. Gets right back to this short ball and muscles it away over the cow corner fence for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 104.5kph from the back of the hand. And {{BATSMAN}}'s picking the screws off it, flat-batting, uppishly, way, way over cow corner. Gee, the audacity\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, VVS was spot-on with his pitch report, he's {{BATSMAN}}finitely trusting the bounce off a length, it's angling away, {{BATSMAN}} lines himself and just casually lofts it over {{BATSMAN}}ep extra cover for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whata a way to bring up the fifty - off 29 balls. Flighted delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and lofts the drive inside-out handsomely over cover. Gentle raise of the bat to the team and the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a poor outing for {{BOWLER}} on his IPL debut. Was too predictable on most occasions. {{BATSMAN}} prepares himself for a short delivery and swings the pull with full flow into the square leg stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is in overdrive. Wants to capitalise on the powerplay. Stays a bit leg-sidish, loads up big time and smacks it with lot of power to send it soaring into the long-on stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dealing in sixes is {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} - it's in the name! A full toss around off, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and swipes it towards deep square leg as he manages to beat the fielder's leap near the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he remains the key for Mumbai. Flighted on off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away by moving to leg, give himself the opportunity to free his arms and lofted it inside out handsomely over extra cover. Cleared the rope comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Kohli walks away in frustration. 20 runs off the final over and make it 36 off the last two. Another full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slices it over point and the short square boundaries help get maximum result\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, here's the first of his dispatches. Where were you hiding {{BATSMAN}}? Gets a friendly length ball - yes. But times the leather off it with a swivelling hack. Right off the screws and right into the crowd over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, \"catch, catch\" shouted Bairstow but it is just over a leaping Shankar. {{BOWLER}} gives it air and {{BATSMAN}} is not holding back, lofts through the line and it was a mishit, stayed up for a long time before evading long-on. 28 off 2 overs and {{TEAM}} are off to a flier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, down the one knee and smashed! Back in the crease with a step and then he picked the bones out of this slower delivery and sent it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over. That last delivery somewhat ruins {{BOWLER}}'s figures - 4-0-32-1. He was unleashed on a surface that aided him and the tall pacer has repaid the decision. This was a back of a length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for it, goes deep in the crease and pumps it over long-on. Not much Stokes could do there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dispatched over long-on! Clear intent from {{BATSMAN}}, doesn't want to settle {{BOWLER}} settle. There is a long-off in place, so he charges down the pitch and goes in the other direction. Over long-on and it was struck so well that it soared into the second tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, small margins for errors. {{BOWLER}} missed his yorker and bowled a friendly full toss, {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for it with a cleared front leg, nice clean swing of the bat and off she goes sailing over the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's ready for the cutter. Stays leg-side of the ball and pumps the free-hit delivery over covers. Highest score for him in IPL\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, mishit. Again. Won't use that famous thing..everytime. Yeah. {{BATSMAN}} skips down the track and lofts over the man at long-off. Eventually it has enough on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed, tossed up well wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} leans across and drags the slog-sweep, didn't get hold of the shot, but has enough to clear the fielder at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, not off the middle really but who cares? He has enough power! The googly and {{BATSMAN}} decided to go with the turn, sliced it away over long-off and easily cleared the fence! Whoa!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that has been flat-batted with a lot of sinewy power! The short ball angled across and {{BATSMAN}} thwarted it down the ground despite not connecting it with the meat of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, nothing mistimed about this one. Hands with a speed greater than 3 x 10^8 as he unleashes a ferocious cut to a short one in slapping it over extra cover. All the way as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 126.4kph, innocuous lazy delivery, off a back of a length sitting up on the pads. And {{BATSMAN}} swipes across the line, getting it over short fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! Just wow! You can't do much when {{BATSMAN}} is in such mood. Seam-up delivery from a goodish length, {{BATSMAN}} decides to go downtown. Moves slightly off-side and bludgeons it over long-off for a gigantic hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely shot! Should be the shot of the match. Carrom ball from Ash, Faf picked it out of the hand, charged out and lofted it with a straight bat right back over the bowler. All the way!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another one to feast on for {{BATSMAN}} and he doesn't miss out. Short and angled into the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} loads up on the back foot and smites it many-a-mile flat over the cow corner fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! 15 runs off the over and {{TEAM}} are surely ahead at this stage. Right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} to swing his bat. He prods forward and thumps it over long-on for a huge six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh he'll run down now. Closes in on where it pitches and then goes inside-out, long levers, long-off. It's KL, the 2018 version\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, going, going, gone... Is there anything he can't do? It's a slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} swipes across the line and muscles it over wide long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, you can't bowl short to this man - this simply sat up to be smacked, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and pummels it high and over mid-wicket for a maximum, 101m hit, a colossal one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} skips a bit, dos not need to dance down. Gets a fullish ball and goes with the swing to dispatch it over the long-on fence. Big hit this one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely shot! Superb use of the feet from the southpaw, sashays down and gets close to the pitch of the delivery, then uses his bottom hand to whip it over the cow corner fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is just a flick from {{BATSMAN}} and it's gone all the way over square leg. Slower ball from {{BOWLER}} that drifted into the pads nicely to be put away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, six again. An action replay of the first six. Just that Baz didn't drop it in the dugout. Using the pace of {{BOWLER}} to a nicety. Expensive over from the Bajan\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, tossed up ball and {{BATSMAN}} makes full use of that. Skips down and goes with the loft. Never intended to hit that hard, clears the long-off fence with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, quick-feeted this time, does just enough to pick the length and marmalize it over KKR's dugout at the long-off area\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a maximum! Even better than the first one. Loopy delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes down and slogs it over mid-wicket. Half a dozen more as it just clears the fence. Was a flat one!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, RJ doesn't learn, tosses one just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets across, plays with the angle and swings it high and over mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gee! How on earth that cleared the ropes. {{BATSMAN}} heaved at this good length delivery, it came off the toe end of the blade and went straight down the ground for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is the flattest hit for six. Rocks back and muscles the pull, over mid-wicket, picked the shortish delivery and was onto it in a flash. Sailed into the crowd\n",
            "Ja{{BATSMAN}}ja to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow. So easy this is for {{BATSMAN}} that it is absolutely ridiculous. Other mortals would have attempted to drive that through cover, but when {{BATSMAN}} saw that tossed up {{BATSMAN}}livery outsi{{BATSMAN}} off he went down on his knee and swept it flat over {{BATSMAN}}ep square leg. The fiel{{BATSMAN}}r was behind square and could only watch the ball go into the cushions\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, I-am-from-McCullum's-team slog sweep. Sits low, gets under this hospitably full ball and punishes it. Admonishes it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is finding his bearings now. {{BOWLER}} errs in length and dishes out a full ball right in the hitting zone, {{BATSMAN}} frees his arms and launches it straight down the ground, pings the sightscreen on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smoked over deep mid-wicket. {{BOWLER}} flights it teasingly outside off, {{BATSMAN}} sinks low and gets under it to smack it all the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, carnage continues! The crowd is loving this. Flighted delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and chips it with ease right over covers, half a dozen more. These two are looking unstoppable\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} attains normal services. Three sixes in a row. {{BATSMAN}} getting into the thick of things. Length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} dismisses it over long-off. Just stood there and dispatched it with disdain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, too easy for {{BATSMAN}}! Angling in and perfect length to hoick, he creams it over mid-wicket for scintillating maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, even better! {{BOWLER}} bowls a full one, right in the slot. {{BATSMAN}} makes room by moving leg-side and lofts it handsomely over deep extra cover. Superb inside-out from the skipper. This is the {{BATSMAN}} we know....\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another full-toss just about waist high from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} gets his front leg out of the way and slams it into the {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket crowd for a massive six! Looks confi{{BATSMAN}}nt, doesn't he?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, sharp short delivery and {{BATSMAN}} is up for the challenge. He gets into position quickly and nails the pull behind square, flat and all the way. Good start to the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 97 metre six! A floated delivery around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and clubs it over deep mid-wicket for six more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and there's the insult rubbed in .. {{BATSMAN}}'s not messing around, staying his ground and for a change not over-hitting as he manages a lovely bat flow in slogging it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fast hands from {{BATSMAN}} come into play again. You cannot bowl length ball at this stage and {{BOWLER}} does that exactly, {{BATSMAN}} picks it up over square leg for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, for a moment, I thought it's headed to long-off. But Finch was there, and the ball would have cleared Finch on Finch's shoulders there. Long, big hit. Made room, as he's been doing, and clouts it over the fielder. Way over him, as I have made amply clear\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length ball from {{BOWLER}}, disappears. What a blow from {{BATSMAN}}. His base was steady as he launched it brutally over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has belted this into the stands for a 94-meter six! It was on a back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} charges down and backs away, keeps his shape and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. This should get him going!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another bat. Another rocket launcher. The angry flat bat face is up and so is the usage in whacking it. Boom. Back into the third stand. Over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, round the wicket, a length ball angling in, no insecurities there, as {{BATSMAN}} uses his long levers to loft it through the line and over long-off for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's got hold of this one! Wow! First signs of {{BATSMAN}}'s abilities. In the slot alright and he's pumped this high over wide long-on. Brute force and to do it against a bowler of {{BOWLER}}'s pace shows that the bloke has the talent for sure\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shot! That's Raina-esque. Slower ball outside off. Overpitched as well, {{BATSMAN}} crouches low and creams the lofted cover drive over extra cover. It came right off the sweet portion of the bat and the ball goes the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is unreal unravelling of {{BOWLER}}, and Delhi Daredevils. Slower on a length say, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and sends it romping over long-off. More timing than anything else\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smoked away! Slower ball but it's in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} has picked it as well. Sits deep to clobber this over long-on. For a moment, Buttler thought he had another catch but in the end, it's well over his head. Brilliant cameo from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 138.5kph, short and wide outside off which allows {{BATSMAN}} to free his arms. The southpaw throws his bat at it and flays it over deep point for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, tossed up on off, {{BATSMAN}} gets close to the ball and lifts it with the angle, sent it high and {{BATSMAN}}ep into the stands at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how high was that hit? What a way to raise a fifty. Such a lovely player to watch at the {{BATSMAN}}ath. Really interesting ploy from {{BOWLER}} to continue to bowl into AB's body than bowl outsi{{BATSMAN}} off stump and make him to force pace. This is just a length {{BATSMAN}}livery that's been absolutely muscled over {{BATSMAN}}ep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Watto is in the house fellas! Gets down on his knee and clubs the floater over mid-wicket, clean as a whistle and it's a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, pure muscle from {{BATSMAN}}. Finally, gets going. Cutter slanted wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} waited and waited before butchering it over long-on. Flat-batted powerfully!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he is looking in his elements today. Form is back, it is certainly back! He identifies the length in a canter(sign of a batsman in form), gets a terrific position and pummels it over deep mid-wicket for another maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now then, now then, it's not a well timed hit but it timed well enough to just clear long-on. Shortish delivery spinning away, {{BATSMAN}} goes back and powers the ball in the air and gets a vital maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full toss and the ball has been banged down the ground! Over the man at long-off and fifty for the skipper in his comeback game! He can do no wrong in this league. That was effortlessly done\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 143ks and that's why it's rushed away to the third man fence. Full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} made some room and carved it away with disdain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fifty for Karun {{BATSMAN}}! Preity Zinta in the stands loves it. Was a short delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the wicket and slaps the slower one over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, who better than DJ {{BATSMAN}} to hit those inside-out shots over cover. You got to admire him. Distraught RCB fans. Delight in the {{TEAM}} camp. Back of a length delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and gets under the ball to smash it over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}'s known for this; hitting biggies at will. Stoops to one knee and gives it a full monty on the slogsweep, found the middle and off she goes. Into the mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there's the release shot. He's been looking for it for quite some time. Fraction short and that is all {{BATSMAN}} needed, quickly moves back in the crease and smashes the pull a long way into the deep mid-wicket stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, so easy. Overpitched by {{BOWLER}} and he sees the white ball fly over long-on. Clean bat-flow and sweetly struck. A welcome {{BOWLER}} won't like\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stunning shot over extra-cover from {{BATSMAN}}. For once, {{BOWLER}} offers a length which the batsman can get under, and {{BATSMAN}} - leaning back - smokes it inside-out. How did he manage to generate that power! Hits flush on the cushions\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely shot, back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}} and he was in complete control here. This was the slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and thumps it over mid-off, went sailing over the ropes for another maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he eats, sleeps and churns out sixes like a mill. Right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}}, he won't spare those. Just muscles it flat-batted over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 13 off 6, and he's slammed the first ball of the final over for six! Far too slow to bother him, and he's nailed this loft over his head for for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dropped and it's Woakes again. He misjudged one in the second over off {{BATSMAN}}, now he's palmed this over the long-off rope. This was an easy catch. Shake of the head. Has already cost the team around 80 runs at least. Shortish and outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} hit that off the back foot, didn't get the distance, but the fielder misjudges the catch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, top-edged .. and taken by Surya at long-on. But he's stepped on the boundary cushion. Straightaway signals a six, making it easy for the umpire. A desperate move from {{BATSMAN}} after three dot balls, he nearly falters but somehow the top-edge flies right at the edge of the boundary, where Surya does really well having stationed himself just inside the ropes. But his weight is leaning back as he stretches overhead and the momentum takes him over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is getting there. He's getting back to being the player he is. Steps out and swats this length ball over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, right in the slot. Talk of the pressure of a chase. Mumbai do not seem to understand though. Sinks, buries and slogs it into the night sky. Rows into the cow corner stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this was coming, this was exactly what {{BOWLER}} was gambling again. He flats it wide outside off, there may have been a deep extra cover, but {{BATSMAN}} carves it powerfully, well over that guy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 15 runs off the over! In-drifter, but the length is tad too full. Ends up bowling it in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and swings his willow hard to dispatch it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, AB tries his best to pull off another one of his Superman catches. But is not able to. Slower delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} picks it away over backward square and he gets the elevation to beat a leaping AB. The South African tried to parry it in but he was not able to\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's more like it, Kings need more of these hits. It was on a fuller length, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it, clears his leg, opens up his shoulders and dispatches it over long-on. High and handsome!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, second six of the over. Fired in but the length allowed {{BATSMAN}} to get under it, he just elevated himself and launched it into the crowd near cow corner. DK walks up to have a word with {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is why {{BOWLER}} was afraid to get anything close to him. The slog-sweep has gone miles. {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across, fetches it from a length outside off and finishes it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, toying with the bowler, toying with his lines, toying with his lengths. This is a full toss and {{BATSMAN}} simply dances down the wicket and wallops it over long-off. Six more! Can't hear anything, the crowd is loving it and so is {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is poor execution from Deepak {{BOWLER}}! He serves another leg-stump dross and it's been picked up neatly from the in-form {{BATSMAN}} who smokes it on one knee and sees the ball sailing over the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a dance and a dispatch. Right up, close and personal to a friendly tosser up and excutes the lofted drive. Clears the tallest man on operation at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brilliant. A slog sweep that's been nailed into the stands, again. Nothing more I can add. He's just seeing the length so early tonight and readying himself for the hits\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, third six for {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} went for the slower delivery after two yorkers. {{BATSMAN}} was sitting in his crease and waiting for that. A mighty swing over long-on and that's the biggest of the lot for him. Chahal is seen clapping from the dressing room\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautifully played, tad too full from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, drives it on the up and clears mid-on with ease - the timing is so sweet that the ball lands on the ropes and it's a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} needs to kick on here. He knew what {{BOWLER}} was doing - bowling back of a length, so he moved across his sticks and muscled the pull over deep mid-wicket. Had to manufacture all the power and he got enough to clear the man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another tripe ball on leg-stump line, it's half a dozen. Banged in short, on leg-stump. {{BATSMAN}} swivels and helps it over disdainfully to fine leg. The ball lands on the ad cushions, the umpires took the confirmation of the third umpire before signalling it a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he has flogged it off his pads for a six over mid-wicket. All muscle from {{BATSMAN}}. I don't think he's got that in the middle at all, but it still clears the boundary comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good length is synonymous to {{BATSMAN}}ath in the {{BATSMAN}}ath overs. Length ball and the batsman hacked the pull shot away to send it packing into the cow corner region. That was out of the top draw from the comeback man!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now puts on the wheels. Comes down the track and mauls it over long-on. {{BOWLER}} clasps his hands but that's not in appreciation, as you'd have guessed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, flat drag down -- just what {{BATSMAN}} needs to break his shackles. Camps behind, swings, flat and deposits it deep into square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Collision between Smith and Stokes. The latter straightaway calls for the physio. After crashing into Stokes, Smith goes bang into the ad boardings. Head first and it bounced off. Smith gets up and has a word with the physio. Seems to be fine. That looked brutal. Slower delivery from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} swung across the line towards deep mid-wicket. Stokes ran to his left and Smith ran to his right from long-on. Both were watching the ball and not each other. It was the Englishman who caught the ball, but once he dashed into Smith the flick back didn't go where he intended\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how did that go for a six? Did Ngidi misjudge that? He ran forward from long-off and then had to come back again. Jumps up in the end, but in vain. Coming to the shot, {{BATSMAN}} wasn't targeting that region. He got down to slog over cow corner. The ball ballooned up off the top-edge and just cleared the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now he's cleared long leg here. Never looked like clearing it, trust me, but this guy packs a punch. Nicely inclined himself outside the line, with no feet, opening the area on the leg-side. Hoicked it up and over, and cleared the man in the deep, who was right at the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, see-ball, hit-ball. As simple as that. {{BATSMAN}} finds one in his arc, brings those strong muscle power and butchers it over long-off. Second six for {{TEAM}}'s skipper..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Doctor {{BOWLER}} changes to round the wicket but there is no respite for him. Proving to be a costly injury that to Nathu Singh. Another length ball and {{BATSMAN}} nonchalantly puts it into the crowd at cow corner. 16 off the first three balls\n",
            "Kul{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dances down the pitch and threatens the cameraman on one of those tiers. Flighted {{BATSMAN}}livery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} got to the pitch of the ball and launches that over long-on. AB {{BATSMAN}} has nicely warmed up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the first bad ball of the over and {{BATSMAN}} says 'Thank you very much!'! Dropped short by {{BOWLER}} and it's launched over deep mid-wicket. Easy peasy for JB\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, exactly! This is what that overthrow has resulted in. A full toss on off and {{BATSMAN}} slams it over long-off as he manages to clear the man at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is exactly what the Chennai crowd wanted. A fuller than a good length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} hoists it over long-off. Set his base and then bludgeoned\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a half-baked bouncer. At half the pace it should have been, so the shortish length is all too easy to deal with. {{BATSMAN}} clubs it over cow corner with utter disdain. Gets to his fifty, another one this season\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh geez! \"This is the shot of the innings,\" calls Sanjay M on air and couldn't agree more. Full on off, {{BATSMAN}} went deep in the crease and whipped it with all his bottom hand over deep backward square. It was just a flick of the wrists and the pace of {{BOWLER}} took care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a hit-me delivery first up from {{BOWLER}}. A leg-stump half-volley at 141.2kph. Easy pickings for the southpaw. The Indian opener flicks it nonchalantly over long leg for half a dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed, that's a long hop from {{BOWLER}}, it was the attempted wrong 'un, sat up to be smacked. {{BATSMAN}} stayed back and flat-batted the pull, high and over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bang in the arc, {{BATSMAN}} obliges it out of the park. Does well to stay inside the line and free up his hands to tonk it into his own dug-out at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is bad bowling now. He is just feeding it in his slot. Flighted and lands it on a fullish length, right where {{BATSMAN}} likes it, he lofts through the line and clearing the fence has not been difficult for him, well over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, okay, his eye is in officially. Also {{BOWLER}}'s tossing this in the slot, when {{BATSMAN}}'s already waiting on a knee. And bang. Over cow corner. Maybe it's still travelling ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, my word! How did this fly over the ropes? A proper mis-hit from {{BATSMAN}}, directs it into the night sky and Virat at long-off was setting himself near the boundary, but it gains some distance and loops over his head. Crazy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fine slog-sweep. Nails it from the meat of the bat. Knelt down and timed it well enough to clear Cutting at deep mid. Who watches the ball sail over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, tossed up on an enticing length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and gets to the pitch, check-lofts it over long-on for six! {{BATSMAN}} turning it on in a big match!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} at his very best. He's very good against spin and shows no respect whatsoever to {{BOWLER}}. Flighted with more air, {{BATSMAN}} lowers his stance and lifts it straight down the ground. The timing is really good and it goes all the way for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! {{BATSMAN}} starting to unleash. {{BOWLER}} goes round the wicket and bowls the back of a length delivery, right in {{BATSMAN}}'s arc and he has no half measures as he deposits it into the deep mid-wicket stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shot! {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knee and smokes the tossed up delivery over deep mid-wicket with a meaty slog. Such. Sweet. Timing! Maxwell does some bhangra in the dug-out to acknowledge the batsman\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, his body lost balance. He was done in by the length, which was full, done in by the lack of pace but he reached out for it. He still managed to drag the ball away over long-off and a six it is\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! That's a {{BATSMAN}} special. Easily done. Short of a good length delivery on off, {{BATSMAN}} moves across, still has the eyes on the ball and scoops it over the keeper's head. Improvisation at its best\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh no! Pan{{BATSMAN}}y has parried it over the rope. Is this the luck {{BATSMAN}} nee{{BATSMAN}}d to get going? This was not all that short and hence {{BATSMAN}} could not get the elevation on the pull, hit it flat towards long-on where Pan{{BATSMAN}}y moves to his left and allows the ball to burst through his fingers. Tough chance but you expect it to be taken\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, floated slightly and {{BATSMAN}} slogs across the line. Connects well and sends over the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, No.2 for {{BATSMAN}}. Picks the slower delivery and out comes the big blade, not a big six, but this will do. No-one at cow corner and he finds the fence. Suddenly {{BOWLER}} is under pressure\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, as long as they fetch runs - mistimed swing again. Gets over the man at long-on; made a bit of room to this length ball and threw whatever he had. Will be happy with the end result for sure\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, well if there is someone catching this it is in the crowds. That's into the railway line. Into one of the Virar locals perhaps. Another variation, in the form of a googly this time and picked out right off the palm as he slogs it while sweeping\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just a lift and off it goes over the long-on fence. For the first time in the over {{BOWLER}} pitches it up, {{BATSMAN}} nonchalantly puts it over long-on. Just an extension of the arm and the ball flew away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a freebie from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} doesn't need second invitations. A half-tracker from the leggie, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and muscles the pull over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, no respite for {{BOWLER}} whatsoever. Tests Alex with a short ball, much like {{BATSMAN}} he gets under it and blasts the pull over the mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is a fine shot. He has a problem with the short ones, much like Raina, but not at that height, at waist-height, he pulls handsomely and sends the white Kookaburra over the deep square leg's head. That shot brings the crowd back to life\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, two men in the deep (long-on and deep mid-wicket), but all they can do is watch the ball sail over the ropes. A harmless short of length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} swings his bat hard and dispatches it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 12 off 3 balls. This delivery had width on it and {{BATSMAN}} picks his spot - deep extra cover, extends his arms and launches it with a clean bat swing over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just when we assumed the earlier flick was good, this one gets even better. Plonks his front leg forward to a pitched up delivery right in the slot and keeps the bat face full in lofting it with all the elegance. Down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, if not for the stands this would have travelled more. Might have got the metro from Pragati Maidan. Fuller length and {{BATSMAN}} cleared his front leg, cracked it hard and hit flat over the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a one-handed six! Short of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard at it, in the process one hand comes off but he somehow manages to clear the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the airrr and just over Pollard at long-off. {{BOWLER}} went full and outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} toe-ended the loft, Pollard jumped on the boundary but it evaded him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, pitched up outside off, seemed like a knuckle ball, but {{BATSMAN}} had no problems picking it. He holds his shape and lofts it cleanly over wide mid-off. Brilliantly timed, goes all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is teeing off now. Reaches his fifty in style. His 3rd IPL half-century. Slower and {{BOWLER}} went wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} goes low and hacks it powerfully over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, backs away, {{BOWLER}} bangs it in, and {{BATSMAN}} spanks him off the front foot well in front of square. That's gone all the way. It's just flying off their bats. Amazing timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, sound! Often that is an indication of the timing. {{BATSMAN}} clubs the length ball over mid-wicket. Looked a bit early on the shot but manages to put more than enough behind the shot to power it over the lurking fielder at the boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he was clueless against Narine. This is a confidence booster for {{BATSMAN}}. Slower ball right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} to swing his bat hard. Moves slightly off-side and lifts it handsomely over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, make that two in a row! Closer to the pitch of the delivery again and {{BATSMAN}} has nailed that over cow corner for a flat maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, steps leg-side, gets a full toss and biffs it straight back down the ground. Another six, his sixth of the evening\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the attempted off-break from {{BOWLER}}, turns out to be a juicy full-toss, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and {{BATSMAN}}posits it high and over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's done it. A couple of sixes to finish the game off just when it was getting away from them. What a player! A full ball on leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} whips it away with unbelievable timing over the deep mid-wicket boundary. Pune clinch the game with a ball to spare\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full ball, buh-bye ball! That has been spanked down the ground over long-off for a maximum! He can hit that blindfold. Overpitched and the batsman just timed it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dumped into the crowd! Fractionally short from {{BOWLER}} and it's not that high to threaten {{BATSMAN}} either. The South African swivels across to shovel the pull high and handsome over {{BATSMAN}}ep backward square leg. Huge hit!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} gets a fuller ball this time. Something that was missing so far in this over. Clubs it straight over {{BOWLER}}'s head. Goes a long way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, six more. 16 off the first 3 balls. {{BATSMAN}} is taking serious toll of what is some very ordinary death bowling. Short of length delivery, neither here nor there. {{BATSMAN}} camps back and bludgeons the pull away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, \"Three sixes in a row for Delhi\" screams Scott Styris on air. Finesse followed by violence. Loads up big time, gets under this full ball and smashes it over long-on. Soars a long way into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! The intention is clear from both batsmen. Slightly overpitched, {{BATSMAN}} gets low and smacks the slog sweep over deep mid-wicket. There was a man in the deep, but he couldn't do anything\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, so the break has helped. It has helped him regain his focus. Picks the bones out of this slower short ball and thumps it over deep mid-wicket for a flat six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fifty in a canter for {{BATSMAN}}. Wow! This guy is a gem of a player. {{BOWLER}} misses his yorker, it was in the slot for {{BATSMAN}}. He clears his front leg, gets in a good position and lifts it over deep square leg for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 3 in a row! Has {{BOWLER}} ever been hammered like this? I cannot remember at all but this is what {{BATSMAN}} does. He can destroy the best of bowlers. Fuller length once more and he just lifts it straight down the ground. Into the sight-screen! He is in the savage mode\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Deepak Chahar catches it......and steps back to ruin the party for CSK! MSD is not pleased and he immediately brings Chahar into the infield. {{BOWLER}} almost started celebrating, but had to hold back and so are the CSK fans in the stands. A loopy full delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the biggie and slices it high into the air off the cue end, the ball keeps swirling and Chahar at long-on couldn't control his momentum around the boundary ropes. Took the catch cleanly but the momentum way always dragging him back. Big moment in the game?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, take a bow {{BATSMAN}}. This time {{BOWLER}} actually gave it some air, {{BATSMAN}} got under the ball and muscled it hard over wide long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there he goes! First of the night for Dre Russ. Googly and {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for it, it landed right in his arc and he went down on his knee to bludgeon it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a gigantic strike! {{BATSMAN}} is in the mood tonight, that's for sure. Shuffles a tad across the stumps and gets a fuller ball closer his arc. Goes through with that classy bat swing of his to send this way into the crowd at deep mid-wicket. 14 off the over! {{TEAM}} are hanging on here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow. Dispatched with authority. Supreme pull shot from the Kiwi skipper. Spots the short ball early, camps back and pulls it witheringly into the deep square leg stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, woah! That's smashed. {{BOWLER}} became predictable there. Slower ball back of a length and {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for this, gets into position quickly and nails the pull flat over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now a shuffle, and goes the other way. It's in line with the stumps, which {{BATSMAN}} now has the spin for help as well as he sweeps it without even bothering to keep it down. Way over fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what do you do to a slow bouncer? You bully it. Despite being in a tangle with your footwork. Had the weight back and could pull the bejeezus out of it. Brilliant shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, up and all the way! He has been good with this shot today - the heave over mid-wicket. Shuffles across and down, gets the right length to send it sailing over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, go fetch that! That has gone out of this orbit. That was flat again from {{BOWLER}} and the batsman shot a firecracker into the night sky to the delight of the {{TEAM}} fans\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, has he sliced this? Yes he has, but that bat in his hands is very good and it takes the ball all the way. The leggie outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} gets down on one knee and goes hard at it, looked like it was going to long-off for a moment, but this isn't Uppal. The boundaries are smaller\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and he ends it with a maximum. Another big over for {{TEAM}}, 17 off it. {{BOWLER}} fires in a full toss around the hip, {{BATSMAN}} was moving around in the crease, stands still at the point of contact and heaves it flat over deep backward square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, up and dispatched. Gives his side something to bowl at on this graveyard. {{BOWLER}} after bowling an eviable yorker misses the next. A cool few inches short and enough time for {{BATSMAN}} to get under it in whipping it over the top. Behind square and into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Mumbai Indians post a competitve score of 161/5 as {{BATSMAN}} finishes it off in style. Gets in a good position and tonks the length delivery across the line. A home-run over deep mid-wicket and Mumbai will be pretty satisfied with the end score\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, follows it with a maximum. He shuffles across to the off-side and slog-sweeps it over the deep square leg for a six. Clean striking from the England batsmam\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 138kph. Now the adventure. He's done coming down the pitch, so shuffles, sits and waits under the good length to scoop it really fine .. 16 off the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is peppering that backward square crowd. Another good length ball right in his arc, he maintains a low base and heaves it with a clean bat swing over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed. {{BATSMAN}} backs away and clatters the half-volley on the stumps back over the head of {{BOWLER}}, flat hit and it went all the way. Power from the diminutive {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, too full. So when it is so full, {{BATSMAN}} can get under that. No chance for the ball doing anything off the pitch too. {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and laces the loft over long-off. Easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smoked over wide long-on! {{BATSMAN}} has to up the ante now, being the set batsman and seems like he has made up his mind. In the slot, slightly oustide off and he fetches it with a clean bat swing. Slog swept merrily over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is his area. Anything on off and middle, {{BATSMAN}} picks it away nonchalantly over mid-wicket. The ball lands right on the ad cushions - second six of the innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, that's a clean hit from {{BATSMAN}}, picked the slower ball early, extended his arms and lifted it high and over long-off for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed over deep mid-wicket. You cannot bowl length to {{BATSMAN}} at this stage. It was a slower one on a good length, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it to arrive and tonks it high and handsome over deep mid-wicket. It sails into the crowd!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Wow! Tossed up, in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} keeps a still head and golf-swings it through the line to deep mid-wicket for four. The most underrated of the big four, and he is proving his credentials today\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is the best we have seen {{BATSMAN}} bat in this season. And it is a positive not only for {{TEAM}} but also for India with WC coming up. {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker, it ends up being in the slot. {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg, keeps his shape and larrups it over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length ball in the channel, {{BATSMAN}} feasts on it with a mighty hoick over cow corner. 87-metres to be precise\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dropped again! Rana is the man again and he fails to judge this skier well. Ends up tipping it over the ropes at long-on for a biggie. Floated up around middle, {{BATSMAN}} went for the lofted stroke down the ground and this went high up into the night sky before setting towards a confused Rana who ended up putting it down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fetches this leg-break from well outside off and muscles it over long-on. {{BOWLER}} turns back as if to say he didn't do much wrong there, and he maybe right. But {{BATSMAN}} looks on tonight\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, glorious stuff from the {{TEAM}} captain! He has come out with clear intent and has decided to unsettle {{BOWLER}}. Expects the floater and is down the pitch in a flash. Lofts it dead straight over the bowler and into the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smoked! {{BATSMAN}} is smashing them to all parts. Small shimmy to convert it into a length delivery, once he did that the rest was easy, went through with the shot and pummeled it over long-on for half a dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} keeps producing some fabulous shots even though he is playing anchor. Picked the carrom ball, used his feet and lofted it through the line, all the way over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, so tempting. So, so tempting and whacked! 85kph, looped up by {{BOWLER}}. It's brave, but it's also too full so it eliminates the risk for {{BATSMAN}} who wallops it over midwicket. Smashes the roof over the first tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ho ho ho! He might have waited 5 years for an IPL debut with {{TEAM}} but has taken one ball to make an impact. Short, down leg and has been lifted over fine leg for a sixer. Whatta start for {{BATSMAN}}!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that shall give him some confidence. Or rather, a lot of it. He's a confidence player. Picks the bones out of this slower delivery and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for half-a-dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bread and butter for {{BATSMAN}}. It looked as though he was waiting for it. {{BOWLER}} drops a rank long hop, {{BATSMAN}} sits back and smokes it over cow corner. Into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, long-on jumped back in desperation, but he never looked like catching that. Clean swing of the willow from {{BATSMAN}}, thumps it from middle-stump channel and deposits it way over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act. Short ball and {{BATSMAN}} pulls handsomely over deep mid. Looked like he was waiting on the back foot for that one and when it came, didn't miss out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, swatted down the ground for a maximum. Full and in the swinging zone, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and murders it straight down the ground for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, quality from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} bowls it short and compliments it with width, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and spanks it over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, look at the swagger on this shot! With due respect to {{BOWLER}}, the man facing him is just too good. Full and in the slot, it's in the arc for {{BATSMAN}} who nonchalantly clubs this into the stands at cow corner. Cold welcome for the young man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} continues to toss it up, too full and right in the hitting zone, {{BATSMAN}} swings and sends it over long-on. When it is so full, {{BATSMAN}} will hit everything out of the park\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is massive, out of the park. Literally. Bowls a slower delivery to start off, {{BATSMAN}} picks it early, gets into position and smokes it over mid-wicket, over the roof and six runs for the big man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is justifying the move to send him up the order. How quickly did he read the slower ball from {{BOWLER}} and lofted it over long-off. Goes the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good use of the feet from {{BATSMAN}}. Puts on the dancing shoes, gets close to the pitch of the ball and swings his bat hard in the direction of the spin. Into the deep mid-wicket stands. Clean strike\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a shot with wings. Lands deep into the crowd. Time for {{BATSMAN}} to use his feet. Ingests the flight and burps out an 85-meter six over {{BOWLER}}'s head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 134.3kph, absolutely holds onto this heave. He's already standing with an open stance, swinging across the line, and then boom. Onto cow corner's second tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Smith has a worried look as {{BATSMAN}} sends another one crashing over the rope. Switched to back of a length and the result remained the same, {{BATSMAN}} went back and nailed it over wide long-on. Pinged the ad hoarding on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's been hit off the back foot, straight back down the ground for six. Some shot. And that's his fifty too. {{BOWLER}} must have thought he'd done enough by sliding it across on back of a length to prevent damage. But {{BATSMAN}} just leans across and thumps it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now then, now then! He isn't done yet! Raises the fifty and DD can mathematically still do this. 20 needed from 4 balls. Backs away to this shortish ball and pulls over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this bloke is a good batsman. Smoked quite a few in the TNPL. {{BOWLER}} floated the googly, but he's lunged forward to that and powered the ball over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, much needed hit for {{TEAM}}. Short delivery and not much pace to trouble {{BATSMAN}}, was bowled at 120kph and sat up nicely, {{BATSMAN}} pulls it off the front foot into the deep square leg stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has destroyed this googly. He has absolutely destroyed it. Slog-swept into the top tier. That's soul-crushing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another one pretty much there. A bit slower you'd think, and {{BATSMAN}} goes straighter here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, too predictable! {{BATSMAN}} knows that {{BOWLER}} will bowl a slower ball. The length was on the shorter side and it sat up nicely for the southpaw. {{BATSMAN}} cleared his front leg and thumped it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, launched over deep square leg! Short balls might trouble {{BATSMAN}} but not this harmless drag down at generous pace. Climbs onto the pull and smashes it into the crowd. {{BOWLER}} better be on his toes because {{BATSMAN}} seems to be lining him up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full toss and {{BATSMAN}} has launched it into the crowd over mid-wicket. That's a gimme and {{BATSMAN}} took full toll of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Bowled a rather decent spell in the last game against MI but he's back to leaking runs. Bowls a gift of a full toss on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} with utter ease flicks it over deep mid-wicket. The timing was bang on!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, woah! What timing. Rashid thought he was in with a chance near the rope but the ball kept sailing over him. {{BOWLER}} in an attempt to dart it in offers an half volley, {{BATSMAN}} backs away and chips the loft inside out, yes just a chip and off went the ball clearing the rope comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot! That's more like it. Short of length around the hips, {{BATSMAN}} gets into a good position this time and smashes the pull into the deep mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh there's the crunch. Another swing, and this one's surely into cow corner. Latches onto the slower one, getting under it and pumping it deep, very deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's what he can do. Actually is in tremendous form in the international circuit but hasn't replicated that in this IPL. But mauls this cutter high into the stands at {{BATSMAN}}ep mid. Stayed back and gave it his all\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's {{BATSMAN}} at his best. Too full and too straight, {{BATSMAN}} sits down and then heaves with all his might, good connection to get it all the way over long-on. Gets the crowd going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, nothing streaky this time. {{BOWLER}} looks for another one to fox the batsman getting too predictable in the process. A mighty swing taking the ball into the clouds before getting it to settle over long-on. Jee, this target setting is getting scary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a one-handed six from {{BATSMAN}}. A full toss, {{BATSMAN}} went deep in the crease and smashes it straight back over {{BOWLER}}, with the bottom hand coming off the bat handle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slower, loopy, leg-stump. Okay, does it matter to a batsman like AB? He just stands his ground and whiplashes it into the crowd over backward square. Gee, the ease...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ufff! When he plays the pull there is no ground big enough for him. {{BOWLER}} errs in length, {{BATSMAN}} had ample time to go back, get into position and nail the pull over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, H-U-G-E! When this man connects well, the ball is going to fly deep into the stands. Slower ball on a good length, {{BATSMAN}} preempted the charge down the track and had a clean golf-like swing. Way into the crowd at long-on. Much-needed one for DD\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} ends the innings in style. Slower short of length delivery, sat up nicely for {{BATSMAN}}, who waits for it and pulls it to deep square leg. The ball teased the fielder, but he could only palm it over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, excellent hit from {{BATSMAN}}! Refreshing intent from the {{TEAM}} former captain and he is wading into the bowling. Short of a length from {{BOWLER}} and Jinks just backs away to flat-bat this down the ground. Such fine connection that it goes all the way. Superb stuff!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, top-edge and six, {{BATSMAN}} was done in by the bouncer, was clearly late on the pull, gets a fat top-edge that sailed over the ropes at fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, becoming too predictable is {{BOWLER}} Patel. The last four balls have been over 100ks. This one's no different either; KP did the smart thing, gave himself room outside off by jumping to the leg-side and tonked this into the cow corner stands with a mighty swing of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this time it goes the distance. {{BATSMAN}} also gets to his highest IPL score. Can he get a hundred? {{BOWLER}} is bowling it in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} muscles it with all his might over long-on. Smith has a worried look\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's an old-fashioned heave. And it will clear long-on with ease. It was a leggie on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} clears his leg, keeps his shape and dispatches it into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, can Gill get there? He can but can only parry it over the ropes. Good effort from him running to his left at long-off. Not easy at all as {{BATSMAN}} lofted it superbly after using his feet. Had enough to get it over the left-hand of the diving fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ufff! {{BATSMAN}} was lining up for the back of a length/ short of length delivery, he moves across and nails the pull flat over deep mid-wicket, the ball goes on to strike one of the ad boardings in the stand. Another costly over from {{BOWLER}}, 19 runs off it and he still has an over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} finishes with a maximum. {{BOWLER}} misses his length and bowls it right in the arc, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and smashes it straight back over. The boundaries straight are not big and it clears 'em with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, BOY O BOY! Clatters the ball out of the park after dropping down on one knee. The moment it hit the bat, it was heading one way - into the oblivion! That was again flattish and the batsman wasted no time in sending it away aerially\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bad ball and he gets the treatment! Leg-break that pitches outside leg and turns towards the left-hander's pad. {{BATSMAN}} won't miss out. Gets down on a knee and nails the slog-sweep over backward square leg. Came down the track as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shot! That's a fine hit from {{BATSMAN}}. Short and at the body, {{BATSMAN}} swivels and pulls, he got it right off the meat as the ball sailed over the long leg fence. The ball is lost in the stands and the fourth umpire brings out a box of replacement balls..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this time {{BATSMAN}} goes leg-side, and collects six. He planted his back foot outside off, got a delivery which landed right in the slot, and shovelled it over wide long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and another.. This just keeps getting bad for Kings XI. {{BOWLER}} lands this right in the arc, {{BATSMAN}} with this kind of hitting form is not going to miss out, he clears his front leg and goes straight, clearing the sightscreen comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, consecutive sixes. The slower delivery from {{BOWLER}} and not sure {{BATSMAN}} was looking to go deep square leg, he intended to hit it over mid-wicket but ended up dragging it over deep square. He won't mind the final result though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, launched well over deep cover! It's raining boundaries here, doesn't matter where they are bowling. {{BATSMAN}} is on another level at the moment. Fullish ball outside off, he didn't get the whole of this lofted stroke but still sliced it way over deep cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} looks around in disbelief. He's not sure how that cleared the rope. Short of length around the hips, {{BATSMAN}} is on the hop as he plays the flick and the ball keeps sailing over backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, carves this googly high and mighty over extra cover. Probably a bit too predictable from the leggie. This is what he was doing against {{BATSMAN}} in the entire last over. This time {{BATSMAN}} anticipates it, sizes it up and smokes it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{TEAM}} right now are an efficient courier service, sending everything into the crowd. Angled in, {{BATSMAN}} played with it, slogging it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 20 off the over. So the move didn't work. This flighted delivery lands right in the arc, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg to get a golf-like swing and he smashes it over deep mid-wicket. Can he get a hundred?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and {{BATSMAN}} goes bang. Well, not quite a BANG, but bang enough. Off-pace back of length delivery, he swipes cross-batted and clears the mid-wicket boundary. It came off the toe-end, but these are short boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, way too many half-trackers from {{BOWLER}} today. Just can't get away with it at this level. {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and blooters it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, drops down on one knee and sends the ball skywards. That was a maximum, the moment it left the bat. He pumelled that with all his might and the ball landed well into the crowds in the cow corner region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, this is dreadful stuff from {{BOWLER}}. What was he trying to bowl there? Steams in and hurls in a full toss that is just over the waist, {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll. Dispatches it into the deep square leg stands. It's called a no-ball for height\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed, a flat six from {{BATSMAN}}, backed away to a short ball and clattered it over cover, went sailing over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, make it four in a row. {{BOWLER}} and death overs are not the best of mates. He goes full and misses the yorker by a couple of inches, {{BATSMAN}} had enough to get under that and smack it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another rubbish delivery from {{BOWLER}}. Googly that is pitched halfway down, {{BATSMAN}} had ample time to pick his spot and it is cow corner, rocked back and pulled it all the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fastest fifty of IPL 2020! A loopy delivery around off and the southpaw has tonked it over long-off for his sixth biggie of the night\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, excellent lofted shot. Full in length around off, {{BATSMAN}} moves away, makes room for himself and times his loft over long-off. Right from the meat and comfortably over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 142.9km/h, doesn't take the pace off this time, short one on the stumps, but {{BATSMAN}}'s trigger is to back away into the on-side - he's absolutely clubbed that, cross-batted, over the long-on fence for six. A fantastic first four balls, spoiled by the last two balls...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, six more! This time goes over deep mid-wicket. This was flighted, {{BATSMAN}} stayed deep in the crease and mowed it powerfully over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another loose ball around off. {{BATSMAN}} swings across the line and for a moment it seems he is in danger of skying this one. But he is not, sends over the long-on fence. Mighty hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} finishes with a long hop. To be fair, it's not abysmally short, but {{BATSMAN}} is so good on the back foot. Rocks back quickly and hammers the pull over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short, wide and six, the plan was to bowl short at {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} had a backward point and a fielder square at point, but this was too short and too wide. {{BATSMAN}} got on top of the bounce, used {{BOWLER}}'s pace and lashed it over the head of third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, these cute Aussie-Kiwi battles. {{BOWLER}} oversteps and then bowls a slower ball, which gets read by {{BATSMAN}}. Clears the front leg and sends it soaring over the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, easy pickings. Picked off the pads and heaved away behind square for a sixer. Not the biggest ground and the ball went over the ropes. Little charge down the track and then the club\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, top-edge but it's that sort of an edge that batsman loves. Unorthodoxy by {{BATSMAN}}, moves across to hoick it across the line with a horizontal bat. A fat top-edge is found and it's going only one way. Over the keeper's head and off she goes for half-a-dozen. Fifty up for the skipper, much vital this for the team. Raises his bat and the dug-out in all applauses\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, has that gone all the way? An overpitched delivery and the batsman checked his drive with power on his bottom hand to hit it flat and just past the diving Christian at long-on. The ball landed on the cushion and the third umpire signalled it as a half-a-dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over Rashid at backward square leg, low full-toss on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} whipped it over backward square leg - Rashid got across and was trying to drag the ball back into play with his right hand, can't do so though\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and six more. He's tearing into {{BOWLER}} here. 22 off the over already, with two balls left. And {{BOWLER}} doesn't know how to react. Poor bowling to be honest. Offers length outside off and is slapped back over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, pumped over deep mid-wicket! {{BATSMAN}} reads the googly to perfection and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for half a dozen. Couldn't have played it any better\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wowww! What a start. This is the very venue where {{BATSMAN}} grabbed eyeballs during a champions league T20 game against New South Wales back in 2009. Looks like he's going to counterattack. Flighted delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} muscles it high over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cheeky and six, how good is this shot? Length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was quick to reverse his stance, plays with an open face and ramps it over short third man, {{BOWLER}}'s pace is enough for the ball to sail over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}'s got hold of this one! Flatter and outside off, he had to fetch this and did so. Chose the safest spot on the ground - straight back down the ground, crashing into the sight screen. Can the old warhorse create a fist of this chase?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, quickly onto his back knee to smoke a slog-sweep over mid-wicket. He sees the ball drifting into leg, it's in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} gets under it beautifully. Just 8 needed now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and he finishes with a six. This is a tremendous over for {{TEAM}}. Watches the slower {{BATSMAN}}livery and carves it high and wi{{BATSMAN}} over long-off. Pure power and CdG ends the innings in style. Boy o boy did {{TEAM}} need that or what\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's masterful! Masterful because he's picked this slower ball, waited and muscled the loft over long-on. Fifty for AB {{BATSMAN}} as well. {{TEAM}} fans would be {{BATSMAN}}lighted to see both AB and Kohli score fifties in the same innings. Part of the reason why they weren't clicking as a batting unit this season. Kohli is so happy for AB\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, chance goes down! Uthappa the man at long-on, don't think he would have managed to stay inside the ropes even if he caught this. Fuller ball and it was lofted down the ground by {{BATSMAN}}. Didn't quite get the elevation on it anc went flat. Luckily for him, just about manages to go for a biggie. Brings up the 50 for {{BATSMAN}}! What a way to start his IPL captaincy stint!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and again! Unlike Corey Anderson, {{BATSMAN}} does not miss out on this short ball. Camps back in time and thunders the pull deep into the stands over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wowww! The shot of the day for me! The greatest thing about this shot was {{BATSMAN}} didn't manage to get close to the pitch of the ball after jumping down the pitch, yet went through the lofted inside-out drive and sent it over the cover boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short ball, {{BATSMAN}} was ready for it. Is quick to stamp his weight onto the back foot and murders the pull over square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, here we go! {{BATSMAN}} is down the wicket as he tonks the tossed up delivery over long-on for a 84 metre six. There was a fielder sprinting across in the deep, but this cleared him comfortably..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, spectator down - into her jaw. Now who's missing Gayle when AB can break jaws as well. Back on a knee, un{{BATSMAN}}r the swinging tonk, and into the second tier at cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 19 balls | 52 runs -- the third fastest of the season. And it's just as stunning a shot to get there, the usual straight high-elbowed lofted punch. It's not everyday that you leave Gayle stranded at 4 off 5 balls while you have your fun\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, crack made the sound! Such a sweetly timed shot that was. {{BATSMAN}} waits back in his crease, reads the slower short ball and thumps it over the cow-corner for six runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now a biggie! {{BOWLER}} is brave to toss this one up, bowls it full and outside off. {{BATSMAN}} gets down on one leg and bludgeons it over wide long-on for a mighty six. New ball, please!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's been belted by {{BATSMAN}}. He sure has some muscle power and he has flaunted it there! He plunges forward, clears his front leg, keeps his shape and absolutely smashes it over long-off for a gigantic six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! {{BATSMAN}}'s intentions are clear here. What a shot this is, nonchalantly picks it off his pads to dump it into the cow corner stands. It was full and in the slot, such fast hands from HP as he takes full toll of the delivery\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a rank long-hop and {{BATSMAN}} has sent it soaring over long-on. {{BOWLER}} tries something funky, bowls a flat off-break on off, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and pummels it high and over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed, short and outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} flat-bats the loft over long-off. Fifty up for {{BATSMAN}}, good knock but he needs to connect them well from here on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this time it comes off. {{BOWLER}} was a bit straight in his line and that allowed {{BATSMAN}} to make contact, sets up a firm base and heaves it over {{BATSMAN}}ep square leg. That should make him feel good\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a shot! He's very good with that pick up shot, fullish and on the off stump, {{BATSMAN}} gets his front across the line and sends it all the way over backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this shot is all about the sound it made. Goes back and across to this short ball and hammers the pull over the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is tonking them big now. That was a length ball, full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} smacks it down the ground with one knee on the ground. That sailed over long-on pretty easily\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full toss on the pads, see you tomorrow! Can't bowl there to AB and that's disappeared at the rate of knots. Straight into the third tier over square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, length delivery on the stumps, right in the hitting arc for {{BATSMAN}}, he gets forward and thumps it high and over mid-wicket, went sailing into the stands for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fetches the length ball and then thwacks the ball over long-on. Length in the later part of the innings spells doom for the bowlers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and now he'll use the turn as well. {{BOWLER}} goes length and {{BATSMAN}} goes tonking them over long-on, swishing the whack, long, hard\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's quality hitting from {{BATSMAN}}. He didn't try to hit it hard, comes close to the ball, keeps his shape and larrups it down the ground. The timing was good enough to clear the long-on fence which is not a short boundary at all\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gosh. Nothing to add. Makes room to a length that has been slightly shortened and Nadals it over long-off. And he says he's not 100 percent..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Mr {{BATSMAN}} why were you hiding in the dressing room in the previous matches. It was a flighted one on a good length, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, makes room and dispatches it over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slower cutter, and the levers have been cut loose. {{BATSMAN}} rocks behind and swings. No, murders. Many, many rows into mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is more like {{BATSMAN}}. This is the {{BATSMAN}} we know. It was a back of a length delivery wide of off, there was enough room available for {{BATSMAN}}. He backs away, brings his willow down at a tremendous speed and cuts it over deep backward point for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it was the slower ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} picks it off the hand and dispatches it over extra cover for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, four followed by a six. That should ideal get him going but not sure today. Short ball at the body, {{BATSMAN}} has no other option but to take it on, the top-edge sails over the deep backward square fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, magnificent shot. Down the track and lifts the back of a length delivery over deep cover. So effortless with so much timing. A crucial blow at the right time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he has finished again with a maximum. {{BATSMAN}} and last ball sixes is a story for the ages! It was angled away from {{BATSMAN}}, was on a length again. {{BATSMAN}} slogs, gets {{BATSMAN}} power behind it. And gets just about enough bat to clear deep square leg who jumped but it was out of his grasp\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, these massive bats. So {{BATSMAN}}'s done in with the lack of pace, he swings across the line, gets the back of the bat. And it finds a way to fly high and into the fence behind the keeper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is not the length to bowl to {{BATSMAN}}. Back of a length, is this carrom ball and {{BATSMAN}} sets himself up for a big shot down the ground, his bat speed ensured that the ball cleared the long-off fence with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act. Short of a length that sits up nicely for him. He backs away a touch and swings over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's scooped this for six, he's scooped this for six. {{BATSMAN}}.... Oh my. Imran Tahir drops his bat and runs across to hug {{BATSMAN}}. There's another run to go, but he doesn't care. Good length cutter angled across off, {{BATSMAN}} bends over - bad hamstring and all - and finds the leverage to lift it over short fine leg. Chennai players are clapping violently\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a 37-ball fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. 40 from 10 needed now, which means literally every ball has to be a boundary. A bottom-handed loft from {{BATSMAN}} that, getting under that full ball and launching it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, comes on. Gets dispatched. A proper sitter, neither-here-nor-there and {{BATSMAN}}'s always been stylish, clearing out his front leg and pulling it bang off the middle over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's what he was trying at the start of the over. {{BATSMAN}} remains the key to this chase. Floated up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} with a stride forward lofts it handsomely inside out over extra cover, just about manages to clear the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smokedddddddddddd! Nothing much you can do when {{BATSMAN}} is hitting them like this. Not even {{BOWLER}} has any answers. Tossed it up, inviting the big hit and that it was for sure. Blasted away by {{BATSMAN}} over long-on for a mammoth blow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} is dishing out freebies. Another nice juicy full toss outside off, just the right amount of width for {{BATSMAN}} to tonk the loft over extra cover. He didn't overhit; just a lift and off she went into the crowd. 17 already off the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, mistimed but six, {{BATSMAN}} just got enough to clear the leaping Billings at wide mid-wicket, got underneath the length delivery, gets plenty of height and just about enough distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} races down, ensures he gets right to the pitch of this googly and smokes it downtown. Already injecting life into the chase and he's only 3 balls in\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, reaches his fifty in style! Comes down the track again and launches it over deep mid-wicket for a mighty six. It has been a terrific innings from the skipper!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, too short from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} stays on the front-foot and then pummels the pull over mid-wicket, went a long way over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dispatched for a six! Stellar stuff from {{BATSMAN}}. It was touch short and was on the body, {{BATSMAN}} identifies the length in a canter, gets in a brilliant position and powers it over deep square leg for a maximum. {{TEAM}} are off to a flier!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX. First T20 hundred for Hashim {{BATSMAN}}. What.A.Player. He posts a leg-side rubbish into the fine leg stands with a clean wallop. Sigh!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, raining sixes at the moment. Good length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} had the space to work with and he accepted the width gleefully, smashed the inside out loft over extra cover for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has gone nuts at the Wankhede. {{BOWLER}} is been taken to the cleaners here from the southpaw. It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} goes back and pumps it over deep square leg for another maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} stamps his authority against spin. Read this tossed up delivery from {{BOWLER}} that was planted outside off, made enough room and lifted it over mid-off. Has enough power to clear the ropes on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, high and handsome over long-off. Flighted just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} loads up and smashes it for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full toss and smashed. A hat-trick of fifties for {{BATSMAN}} and this is a bloke who went unsold originally and was picked last minute at base price. He hits this straight and does the \"baby celebration\" of his. Gets a great round of applause from the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hammered away! {{BATSMAN}} is on the rampage now. Of course, half-trackers like these help as well. Was on the back foot in a jiffy and smashed the pull over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's right in the swinging arc for Mayank {{BATSMAN}}! Loopy on off-stump, he gets underneath the flight and pumps it for a mighty maximum straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a wonderful shot! Shows the nature of the track. An away-slanter from a good length, {{BATSMAN}} squats, reaches for it and slaps it over cover. Off the middle and the ball has enough wings to go all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, non-chalance in that flick - a microsix, 62 meters, flicked away over a leaping Dhawan at deep backward square leg for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, makes him bowl a full toss. Misses the yorker, the dew isn't helping him either. And {{BATSMAN}} doesn't need these, really. You don't have to be this kind. Carved away, deep extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's what he can do. Actually is in tremendous form in the international circuit but hasn't replicated that in this IPL. But mauls this cutter high into the stands at {{BATSMAN}}ep mid. Stayed back and gave it his all\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just the over {{BATSMAN}} needed to get some impetus to his innings. This is a good old fashion slog sweep, {{BOWLER}} errs by giving it some air and {{BATSMAN}} kneels to get underneath it, struck powerfully enough to clear the fielder in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, crunched! The big man kicks off the six-hitting for the night. Expected the short ball and was ready on the back foot, swatted the pull over mid-wicket. Made a cracking sound off the blade\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, is it {{BATSMAN}}'s night? Has been quiet in the tournament and has been in-and-out of the side as well. Picked the back of a length slower delivery, pivoted on his front leg and pulled it over deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, steps down, makes room for himself, gets it perfectly in the slot, and tonks this into long-on's first floor\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, even better! {{BATSMAN}} is looking in fine touch here. Shimmies down the ground and lofts it over long-off. Exquisite timing. He didn't try to hit the ball hard. Relied on timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a smaller six but perhaps a better shot as he had to drag it from outside off. So much power in the bottom hand as he swipes a flat six over wide long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, makes room and goes outsi{{BATSMAN}} leg, sits down and then unleashes the slog-sweep. A flat hit over mid-wicket and all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive! For a second it seemed to be traveling out of Chinnaswamy. {{BOWLER}} changes his line of attack - comes round the wicket and slants it right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and heaves it deep into the mid-wicket stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, his first ball in the match has sailed over long-on. wow. Full and swung away. {{TEAM}} finish with whoppin' 245\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, pressure releaser for {{BATSMAN}}. He was not getting anything off the middle till now. {{BOWLER}} floats one up and {{BATSMAN}} takes it on, slog sweeps straight down the ground and collects half a dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} connects one. Scooches low and smacks one over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} flexes his muscles and tonks one straight over {{BOWLER}}'s head for a maximum. Thrown well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} fetches it from there after bending low and slammed it beautifully straight down the ground. Ruins a good over from {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, umm. Sitting up in the slot, and {{BATSMAN}}'s sitting too. Full-swing, slogging it into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, welcome back to the attack, {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} lays into him, showing no respect to this full ball. Right in his arc and that's been slammed straight down the ground for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} attacks the debutant off his very first ball. Dances down and launches him back over the long-off boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, drop-kicked! Gone for a sixer. The batsman goes with the turn and muscles the ball over long-off for a maximum. {{BATSMAN}} is up and away!!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brings up his fifty in thunderous style! {{BATSMAN}} roars back to form for {{TEAM}}. Short ball, 116kph, and it goes soaring into the second tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he was clueless against Narine. This is a confidence booster for {{BATSMAN}}. Slower ball right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} to swing his bat hard. Moves slightly off-side and lifts it handsomely over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh my goodness! Even {{BOWLER}} won't be spared. High and handsome. Slightly fuller in length and {{BATSMAN}} sends another one into the deep mid-wicket stands. Down on his knees to clout it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is entertainment. Full length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} keeps his head still and powers it over long-off for six more, the bowler is under pressure, straightaway\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slows the pace down, tossed up above the eye-line, the googly, {{BATSMAN}} spots it, hurries down the track to the pitch of it, and lofts it straight down the ground for a colossal six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there goes another! {{BOWLER}}'s death bowling issues this season continue. Is being taken to the cleaners tonight as well. Slower but it's on the shorter side, {{BATSMAN}} gets hold of it and pulls it away over deep backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has not given up, not just yet. A pitched up ball around off, clears the front leg and and cracks hard. Kohli at long-on gets fingertips to that. Not good enough to parry it back. {{BOWLER}} is down again. But wants to continue after having a word with the skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, heaved over deep mid. Sliding on, on the middle and leg line, {{BATSMAN}} sunk under that and clouted it high and over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stylishly done, just a pick-up swivel from {{BATSMAN}} and he sends it into the stands at wide long-on. Was quick to read the length, stayed on the front-foot and launched it into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX. All over! Some glum faces among the crowd. Three back to back wins for {{TEAM}}. A right-han{{BOWLER}}d version of Ben Stokes, {{BATSMAN}} waits for the short ball, once it arrives, he mur{{BOWLER}}rs the pull flat over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is remarkable from {{BATSMAN}}. He's come out and nailed two balls out of the three he's faced. {{BOWLER}} misses his mark with the yorker, offers it in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} tonks it over long-off's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hugeeeeeeeeee! {{BOWLER}} decides not to bowl the slower ball and it disappears. Fullish and in the slot, lots of pace and it's in the arc as well. {{BATSMAN}} does the needful by bludgeoning it way over long-on. Handy blows, these, for DD\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Reaches the landmark in style. A rank long hop from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} is onto it in a flash. Skips back and smokes it away into the deep mid-wicket stands. 14 runs off the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh boy, do we have something special on tonight?! Back to back sixes. This one is a sizzler over extra-cover. Another poor delivery from {{BOWLER}}, bowling it full in the slot around off. {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and smokes a stunning drive inside out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, here's six of them. He's deep in the crease to {{BOWLER}}, he's cleared his front leg and he's swung this into the stands behind deep midwicket. {{BOWLER}} missing his length there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how is he not playing every game? He's turning it on here for {{TEAM}}. Just a bit of air from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} kneels down and nails the slog sweep to perfection, flat and over cow corner. BTW, it is his fifth six of the evening\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, last ball of the over fetches six more. {{BOWLER}} wouldn't like this. He's the most expensive buy of this IPL among Indian players. Short of a length around off, {{BATSMAN}} camps back and hammers it over mid-wicket for a flat six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, all the way. That's a consequence of going through with his shot. Didn't hold back at all. Fullish around off, {{BATSMAN}} has the swinging room he desires and launches into it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now the advance, stepping away from the line to free up his hands. And his hands take it inside-out over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, sees some loop on the delivery, and puts his dancing shoes on in a flash. That's superb batting. He got right to the pitch before launching it straight back for six. 13 off {{BOWLER}}'s final over. It's set up superbly for the final four\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, pretty full from {{BOWLER}}, and this is brilliant use of the crease from {{BATSMAN}}. He takes a step back which allows him to get under the ball. Mid-off was up in the ring, so the idea was to just loft it over him. And despite the bat turning in his hands, it still clears the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, third six of the over, this was tossed up wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and thumps it high and way over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brilliant shot. He is backing away and having to reach out but awesome timing on the lofted square drive. It was full and outside his reach, but somehow {{BATSMAN}} got it over the deep point fence. All timing and the crowd have found their voice back\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there goes the riposte from the {{TEAM}} skipper. He planted his feet leg-sidish and created enough room for a whip of the hands. The ball soared into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is not given up yet. Length delivery right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} winds up with the front leg cleared and gives it his all, heaved away into the deep mid-wicket stand\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, first one of the night. Was bowling so well before this delivery. Should have stuck to his lengths. Offers a juicy half-volley outside off and {{BATSMAN}} goes hard at it, swings hard and gets a thick outside edge that flies over third man. Not convincing enough for the batsman but he'll take that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's raining sixes in Jaipur. {{BATSMAN}} gets hold of it and slogsweeps it over deep square leg for another massive six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's the shot of the game for me. Lovely use of the feet, comes dancing down towards the pitch of the ball and bulldozes it into the mid-wicket stands. Tonk!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, watch out, those in the press box! Off-pace ball from {{BOWLER}}, but he's doled out a half-volley. AB {{BATSMAN}} gets un{{BATSMAN}}rneath it and bludgeons it downtown for a massive six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dropped. Nabi palms it over for a maximum at deep square leg. Very sloppy, should've taken by his standards. Whipped across the line and went towards deep square leg, Nabi sprawls across and gets both hands on it, only to tip it over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow. Just wow. This is sheer timing. Also shows you how good the pitch is. Makes some early room down leg and just chips it. Carries well over the long-off boundary. See it to believe it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Cometh the hour, cometh the captain. This is what responsibility has done to DK. He is a completely different batsman and this knock should rate among his best. Shuffles across, bends down and sweeps it high and into the stands at fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finally. FINALLY. {{BATSMAN}} goes uppish, shows intent, getting under {{BOWLER}}'s juicy length delivery to smoke it over long-off. Also, a fifty, and no one's keeping count anymore, there's no point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, pushed through just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track, doesn't get close to the ball, went through with the swing and sends it sailing over long-off for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, launched over long-off! {{BATSMAN}} is looking in superb touch today. Tosses it enticingly just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} props forward and clobbers it disdainfully for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 105kph. Dropped short, {{BATSMAN}} still takes it off the front leg, freeing up his hands once again over long-on. Ah, flat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bosh! Shot. Never bowl short to {{BATSMAN}}, Sran finds out why. Short ball aimed at the torso, {{BATSMAN}} was ready for it. Picked the bones out of it and muscled it way back into the deep square leg stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the air and over the rope. Seemed like a mishit by {{BATSMAN}} but it carried a good fair distance. Flighted outside off and {{BATSMAN}} lofts it down the ground, clearing long-off. 13 off the over and it was much needed for Delhi\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over.. {{BOWLER}} knows how close it was. Short of length and there was no pace on the ball, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the pull and the top-edge clears a leaping Tripathi near deep backward square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length delivery outside off and {{BATSMAN}} launches it over long-on. Clean bat-swing and the ball sails over the fielder's head. The wicket of his skipper hasn't put {{BATSMAN}} off at all\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how that's! Skid it into {{BATSMAN}}, who went with it and swung it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hoisted over long-on to wrap up a clinical win for {{TEAM}}. Set himself up for this length ball and launched it into the night sky, falls way back into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another slower ball and {{BATSMAN}} has nailed this for a maximum. Moved back and across, waited for it arrive and smashed it flat and straight over mid-off, it crashed straight into the boundary hoardings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good effort from the man in the deep, but he couldn't stop it from going into the fence. A 68-metre six. A leg-break, {{BATSMAN}} gets down and slog sweeps. Doesn't quite get it off the middle of the bat. Nitish Rana at deep mid-wicket waits for it at the edge of the rope. But, the ball had just about enough elevation to go over him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, that might get AB going, banged in short and just outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, in the zone for AB as he pulls it over mid-wicket, went sailing over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is turning out to be an expensive over for DD. Went full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} jumped across and lifted it over mid-off. Not off the sweet spot but enough to take it all the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} ran in hard and then bowled a slower delivery, was right in the lofting zone for {{BATSMAN}} who got forward and muscled it over long-on. Six more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, pick up off the pads. And the spectators pick it in the stands. Onto the hips as it angled in and the batsman just clipped the ball away with a lot of nonchalance to soar it over deep backward square. Back-to-back sixes for Watto\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, early signs: good pitch against the new ball. Length ball right in {{BATSMAN}}'s arc and he goes for it. Will go, 10 out of 10 times. Swings it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the yorkers too cannot stop the bleeding. {{BATSMAN}} rocks way inside, crouches, gets underneath the supposed yorker and carries on from the finals a year ago in tonking the drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's getting worse for {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} skates down the track again, meets the pitch and extends his arms into a lofty hit over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, nailed over long-on. Gentle off-break from {{BOWLER}} which is right in the slot. {{BATSMAN}} grounds his back knee and wallops it through the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed, length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} is all over it like a rash. {{BATSMAN}} was waiting on it, plays with the angle and sends it high and deep into the stands at long-on, 103 m hit - the second longest of IPL 2018\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, round-arm ball from round the wicket, a length ball outside off at 93.5kph, {{BATSMAN}} swings his bat hard and deposits it over long-on. Got it off the bottom of bat, but all those won't matter at this ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the ball hits the ad cushions on the full. Slanted across the right-hander, {{BATSMAN}} stands his ground and smokes it over extra cover. Two men in front of square riding the boundary and he split them to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brings up the 200 and the 50-run stand in style. The cross-seam full delivery, {{BATSMAN}} stays right back in his crease and lifts it over mid-off, the 146kph delivery sailed over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there comes the sweep. He has got outsi{{BATSMAN}} the line as he sits and then takes it from around fourth stump line, sweeps and connects beautifully, sends it into the {{BATSMAN}}ep backward square leg fence. The ball just flew off the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, banged in short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was waiting on it, swivels across and pulls it high and over square leg, no need to run for those\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, wow! What's more it is a no-ball as well. For height. Over the waist. Full-toss gone wrong and he has belted that into the crowd at {{BATSMAN}}ep square. That hit brings the ladies on their feet - with one even whistling away to glory\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} taken to cleaners. He has the Orange Cap now. A floated delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} goes after it with all might and clears the long-off fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that looked like a half-hearted shot from {{BATSMAN}} and it has travelled the distance. Picked the back of a length delivery and pulled it to the vacant deep mid-wicket region, just cleared the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, plenty of hang time but {{BATSMAN}} gets the desired distance as well. He goes down on his knee and slog sweeps it over deep mid-wicket, managed to clear the rope comfortably in the end\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clears the mid-wicket fence, but only just. It's a baby six by {{BATSMAN}}'s gigantic standards. It was a slower one on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, clears his front leg and powers it over deep mid-wicket.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a shot with wings. Lands deep into the crowd. Time for {{BATSMAN}} to use his feet. Ingests the flight and burps out an 85-meter six over {{BOWLER}}'s head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's on the roof! {{BOWLER}} isn't learning, errs on the fuller side again and it's slower too. {{BATSMAN}} mows it over long-on for a huge hit. {{TEAM}} sensing that this is the time to go big\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the slot and out of the park. 500th six of the tournament. Loops it up in the arc for {{BATSMAN}}, no turn. {{BATSMAN}} lowers his stance and launches it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, where has this gone? Monster hit from {{BATSMAN}}. Remember him playing a similar kind of shot in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he's so good with the flicks and glances. {{BOWLER}} bowls the inswinger onto his pads, {{BATSMAN}} says thanks and decimates it a long way into the grass banks at deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, number 2! {{BOWLER}} is erring in line and {{BATSMAN}} is not one to miss out. This one drifts in on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and muscles it flat over deep mid-wicket. The fielder was left as a spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massacred away! The {{BATSMAN}} show continues. Full and in the slot, poor bowling and it's been punished as well. Shoveled away over deep mid-wicket for another huge six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, SMACK! Parag at the boundary has woefully misjudged it, and not for the first time, the outfielder is pointing at the floodlights! Charges down and carts it, with a bit of a hind-limb pirouette, over long-on for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, time for {{BATSMAN}} to show what he's got. Pitched up and right in the swinging zone outside off, {{BATSMAN}} marmalizes it over long-off with a clean swing of the willow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, these small boundaries, I tell you. This was a miscue, right off the cue-end but the ball just clears the rope. A low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} didn't get it off the meat, but enough to clear cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is bigger. And longer. Full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and gives it all, off the middle of the bat and way back into the stands. Nailed that and the ball flies away to the deep mid fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he has got his eye in and he has smashed this one for a gigantic six. It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, clears his leg, gets under it and tonks it over long-off for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, no he cannot! Because he is bowling to someone who is in insane hitting form this season. Misses the yorker and it's a low full toss, {{BATSMAN}} just uses his quick hands and it's a short arm jab. Comfortably over deep square leg. No effort at all there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, low full toss again and {{BATSMAN}} flogs it over square leg. He is 18 off 5. What a blinder!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, why? Just why? Coaches, experts plead not to bowl length at the death but {{BOWLER}} has bowled a slower ball halfway down the pitch. {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and flat-bats it really straight. What a finish for {{TEAM}} - 201\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, first maximum of the match! Loopy delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, makes room and towers it cleanly over long-off for his first big one of the night\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, right up there and {{BATSMAN}} has teed off. Full on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} lofts and clears long-off. He can time them really well too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shot! {{BATSMAN}} is definitely finding his touch! Dances down the track to this flighted delivery, gets to the pitch of the ball and tonks it powerfully over long-on. Moves to 49!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slogs and connects well. Moved off-side even before the ball was delivered and positioned himself for the big mow. The offie was in his slot and {{BATSMAN}} clouted it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, eish! This guy! It's a full toss alright but look at that bat swing. Brutal. Swings this full toss over deep mid-wicket. Way over. 32 off 8 needed..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 105.1kph. Length now, {{BATSMAN}}'s into death mode already, committing big-time into a tonk downtown, smashing the free-ticketers at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, too predictable. {{BOWLER}} sticks to his length that is on the shorter side. But the line is even worse as {{BATSMAN}} picks it up with ease and clears fine leg for half a dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length ball outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, AB clubs it clean over extra cover. That's gone straight into the second tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 50 for the combo! That was a short ball, never got enough wood on it but enough on it to send it packing just over the man at mid-wicket. There were shouts of catch it but that region was unmanned\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, \"looks like he is having a net,\" quips Gavaskar on air. He is treating them that away and has even impressed his skipper at the other end. Flighted and lands full, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and goes straight, that high backlift allows him to have a clean swing and it goes over the roof\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} joins the act. Gets one right in the slot and he isn't in a mood to spare these. Swings his bat down and plunders it down the ground. A crowd catch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, misses his length big time and {{BATSMAN}} laaaaaunches into it. It's a monstrous six over long-on. Probably aimed for the yorker there but ended up bowling right in {{BATSMAN}}'s slot. Disappears\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's in the airrr, mistimed, the fielder jumps and it just escapes him. So that's the game for {{TEAM}}. They top the points table. Fittingly {{BATSMAN}} hits the winning shot. Length ball, {{BATSMAN}} went for the loft straight, long-on ran to his right and jumped but couldn't get a hand on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, okay, finally, a hurry. {{BATSMAN}} gets half a press in front and lofts his whip, many rows into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how nicely has that been played. That's a slower short ball but {{BATSMAN}} steps out and loops the pull over his shoulders. Just helped the ball there to the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just clears deep mid-wicket! Typical DK stroke. Half volley on leg stump, he holds his shape and doesn't go hard at it. Rather swings with the flow and it has enough to clear Chahal in the deep. The skipper is keeping {{TEAM}} afloat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, straight down the ground! The pressure builds, {{BOWLER}} bowls a full-toss on middle and off, {{BATSMAN}} nimble down the track and clubs that straight down the ground into the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, superb shot! Bouncer well outside off, a slight move across from {{BATSMAN}}, followed by an upper cut over third man. Both his feet off-ground when he made contact with the ball. Classy shot. Timing and placement was spot on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, top-shot! Dashes down, wasn't entirely to the pitch of it but decides to go with a big hit and gets enough bat behind it to deposit it into the stands. He played it against the spin, mind you! It needs some skill\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another one to feast on for {{BATSMAN}} and he doesn't miss out. Short and angled into the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} loads up on the back foot and smites it many-a-mile flat over the cow corner fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's hit this miles! slower ball around off, right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} who smokes it down the ground. This has cleared the boundary, and then some, as he clinches it for {{TEAM}}. What an insane, insane finish to wrap up the drama of a final over which will be talked about for a while\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, magnificent shot by {{BATSMAN}}! Russell hit 8 sixes in his innings but {{BATSMAN}} has just hit his 9th maximum of the night. Gets inside the line and picks up the length delivery over deep square leg for half a dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, too full from KG, right under {{BATSMAN}}'s arc and he doesn't let that go unpunished - gets forward and thumps it high and over long-on, went into the top tier for a 99m hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh ho ho! Middles this like a dream! That sound off the blade, wow! Back of a length, sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} who smokes it deep into the stands at mid-wicket. It was just a bit of a short arm jab, such power from the young man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, sits up short. And {{BATSMAN}} isn't hanging around waiting, takes it off the front foot and muscles it uppishly over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} makes {{BOWLER}} pay the penalty. Flighted full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} chips out of his crease, flexes his muscles and smokes it over long-off. Stand and dismiss stuff\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 138.1kph. It's the good length with {{BATSMAN}} in the slog mode. He steps away, frees up his hands and lofts the flat-batted tonk over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bye bye ball. Slips on the legs of {{BATSMAN}}. Was a slower ball and {{BATSMAN}} whipped it from there, skies it high but gets the distance as well. Manages to clear Dhawan at deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, downtown. Talk about rubbing it in. Two lives, and a celebration with a hoick straight down. All muscle, perbably denting the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, top-edge and six, too predictable from Shardul, banged in short and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was swiveling across on the pull - was in no control, the top-edge went high and behind square on the on-side, just has enough to clear Unadkat at deep backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the misery is piled on. This time with the length getting even more horrific. In the form of a rank drag down. A rock back, a swivel and a dispatch off a flat batted mow into the mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is the class of {{BATSMAN}}. This is what he can do. This was a full length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} frees his arms and carves it over third man. Beautiful shot!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn! What quality strokeplay! Fullish ball around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} makes room by backing away lot and just goes through with the extension of the loft down the ground. Such timing and over long-off again it is, deeper this time. 16 off the over!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, my word does he have some ability with the bat! This is a stunning shot. Makes some room to a length ball and flat-bats it over long-off. Wow Deepak {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, flat and over the fielder at deep square leg. Short and quick on leg, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it and drags it powerfully over the man in the deep, that went like a rocket, lot of bottom hand on that blow by {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smoked it! Tossed up delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} slogs this over mid-wicket for half a dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short ball, {{BATSMAN}} clatters the pull off the top-edge, over the keeper's head but who cares? It's a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, where are the seat belts? The {{BATSMAN}} show is here. Full ball and the batsman hammers the ball over long-off for a huge six. This man has made a statement. A big one. 46 off 19 balls!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, that's a nasty nasty delivery from {{BOWLER}}. He came to {{BATSMAN}} to apologize immediately. It was a full-toss above the waist height, {{BATSMAN}} gets his bat down in a good position and smashes it over short fine for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautifully played, the leg-break from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} gets a good stride forward, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and lifts it majestically over cover, went sailing over the ropes for a maximum - {{TEAM}} making a statement with the bat and the ball has been lost in the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} picked the bones out of that. Length delivery right in the slot and it was a clean swing of the bat from {{BATSMAN}}, lofted it with a straight bat and cleared long-on with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is rubbish bowling. Short and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands upright and slaps it flat over extra cover, got enough power behind that to clear the boundary rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the slot and that disappears! This man is a visual delight. Pitched up and {{BATSMAN}} went bonkers to send it over long-off for a sixer\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, even longer. {{BATSMAN}} turning it on here. A scarred ball this - flat, dragged down and real quick. Just the pace required to go for another muscling swat into the favoured cow corner region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there's nothing brute about this shot. Just a serene pick up off his hip, just watched the ball spear into the leg-side and did well to get inside the line and help the cherry on its way for a 75-metre maximum over fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, freebie and away she goes into the crowd! 50 on captaincy debut in the IPL for {{BATSMAN}}. Promoted himself at a crucial part of the run chase and now seems in command. Has to finish it though. Poor ball from {{BOWLER}} who gives a full toss and it's swung over deep square leg Way into the crowd\n",
            "Kul{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's not a bad ball at all from Kul{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}}. Not easy to time the away spinning ball. So Kul{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} bowls one full googly outsi{{BATSMAN}} off stump, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the loft over cover, slices it but the timing it good enough to clear the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gets the slog right. Invites him with an airy googly does {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} throws everything he has into it. Slices it up, slices it high and slices the projectile long enough to take it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there's the fastest IPL fifty. Sunil {{BATSMAN}} is the proud owner of that record. If someone had told me that he would be the holder of that record, I would be laughing my guts out, but here he is proving almost everyone wrong. Short of length and {{BATSMAN}} goes on his toes and lofts it over long-on. That is a very difficult shot to play and even the best of batsman find it hard, but {{BATSMAN}} does it with ease. The {{TEAM}} dugout are on their feet and GG is leading the applause. For once he has a smile on his face\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! Just wow! This man is a powerhouse. That was just punched. Maybe a dropkick of a punch drive and the ball just kept on going and going. It easily sailed over the man at long-off. Slightly pulled back length and the batsman had no hesitation in going through with the shot and hitting it through the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, muscled away! {{BATSMAN}} is on a roll here! Shortish and a bit of width as well, he feasts on the offering with a ferocious slap cut over sweeper cover. Bludgeoned it!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is just toying with the bowling now. Bowlers are not sure where to bowl to him. {{BOWLER}} goes wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} uses the long lever to thump it straight down the ground, all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, DK knows all about {{BOWLER}}. Both play together for Tamil Nadu, a step towards the ball and then swung it from his hips over deep backward square, was a back of a length delivery but such is the form that DK is in, he has hit it for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautifully played, tad too full and wide from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, gets close to the ball, extends his arms and launches it over mid-off went sailing over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, an away-swinger, nothing wrong with this one, on a good length and not a lot of width, {{BATSMAN}} just backs away and has a flash at it - and he's sliced it away over {{BATSMAN}}ep backward point for six. Just over Bhajji at the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there he goes. High percentage shot. Picked the gap and used his wrists to good effect. Generated enough power to send it over the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, A six to finish. Does not matter. 9th successive win for RR in Jaipur and 7th successive win against DD. The rains might have done them a favour. That was full and the batsman clobbered it down the ground by holding his shape nicely to send it over long-on. RR win this 10 runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, H-U-G-E! When this man connects well, the ball is going to fly deep into the stands. Slower ball on a good length, {{BATSMAN}} preempted the charge down the track and had a clean golf-like swing. Way into the crowd at long-on. Much-needed one for DD\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh dear! {{BOWLER}} fails to get his landing right and bowls it in the arc for {{BATSMAN}}. Gets dumped over long-on, effortless from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}} and how well did {{BATSMAN}} read that. Goes on his knee and slog sweeps it to send it deep into the mid-wicket stands. That's a huge hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, {{BATSMAN}} is in the mood today, short of a length and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivelled across on the pull and sent it miles in the air - high and over {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hat-trick of sixes. {{BOWLER}} was brave to toss the ball again. Danced down and bludgeoned it over long-on. 17-ball fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! A superb knock from the southpaw\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this will hurt KKR. {{BATSMAN}} can play this shot in his sleep. Lenght ball down leg, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and hacks it behind square for a maximum. Easy pickings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is in a beastly mood tonight, lovely leg-break from {{BOWLER}}, slower and wider outside off, nearly did {{BATSMAN}} in with the length. He had to lean forward, goes inside out and carves it over extra-cover, went sailing over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, consecutive sixes for {{BATSMAN}}. Should have been caught. Once more goes with the turn, lofts the leggie towards long-off. Got height more than the distance, Christian moves across to his left and parries it over the fence. He misjudged the rope behind him. There was enough space to go a foot back\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! What a strike. Full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} engineers room and slices it with an open bat over extra cover. Such is the power that it carries all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, seven balls faced and he has got his eye in now. It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and clobbers it over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 139kph, bouncer, nah, never mind. {{BATSMAN}} stands with an opened up stance, whacks a pull, and gets it high, almighty outside the stadium, via fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Delhi openers dealing in sixes! Another short ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slashes hard at it and gets an outside edge. This one flies over the cordon and that's six more for the Capitals\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's gone all the way! What a shot! That too under pressure! Mind you this shortish length ball clocked 145kph but that's also what aided {{BATSMAN}} here. He stays back and upper cuts it over short third man. Deep into the crowd. Just the over {{TEAM}} wanted to ease a few nerves in the dug out. What a way to get to fifty! Top knock but he knows that the job isn't done yet\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fuller ball and has been whipped away over deep mid. This is what a redemption does to a batter. Frees his arms and helicopters it over deep mid for a sixer. Oh Raina!!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, top-edge! Six! Gosh! Over long-on. That was unbelieveable. The short ball, the batsman seemed to be slightly late on it and the ball flew away over long-on fence. Incredible\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, pops {{BOWLER}} over long-on to raise his fifty! The equation has come down to a run-a-ball. Don't think he got this one off the middle either, but got enough to just clear the leaping fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that ball hung in the night sky for eternity. Never looked like coming down. For what it's worth {{BATSMAN}} gets the maximum result. Length delivery right in the swinging zone and {{BATSMAN}} did not hold back, went full-monty and heaved it over deep mid-wicket. Six number one for {{BATSMAN}} in IPL 10\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fuller and wider, {{BATSMAN}} frees his arms and lays into it, sends {{BOWLER}} for a 83-metre maximum over long-on. He's striking the ball clean as ever is Rishabh {{BATSMAN}}, just one short of his fifty now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dispatched with disdain! It's too late though. {{BATSMAN}} latches on to the short ball and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for a flat six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he promised some fireworks this year and he's keeping up his words. Anticipated the length to be short, got quickly into position and smashed the pull over the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, geez! That ball hardly left the surface. A flat six from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} missed the yorker by a good couple of inches, {{BATSMAN}} got underneath it and heaved it over deep mid-wicket. {{BOWLER}} leaking plenty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, same result! {{BOWLER}} persists with the shorter length, {{BATSMAN}} whistles it into the same area with a mighty bat swing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is precisely why SRH need {{BATSMAN}} ASAP! Just look at him run down at SRH's key bowler. Got beaten previous ball, but no respect whatsoever and he forces Bhuvi to shorten the length, with it swings across the line with a pull and powers it over the mid-wicket boundary. He's just toying with them\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive blow and {{BATSMAN}} likes that. Has 50 and points at the base of his bat to someone in the dressing room. All done with a smile on his face. Makes room and the length ball is clattered miles into the {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket stands. More of a golf-swing that from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends down on one-knee, picks up the length and swipes it high and way over wide long-on for a humongous hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed! {{BOWLER}} errs by landing it in the arc and {{BATSMAN}} sends it straight back over him. Overpitched and the extension of the arms is enough to take it all the way over the boundary rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, roll back the clock - it's that {{BATSMAN}} of the old. Sran goes short, eventually sitting up and {{BATSMAN}} smokes, flat-batting it big into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, down the track he comes and clobbers it! Just a casual swing of the arms to send it rocketing back over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, pushed through just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track, doesn't get close to the ball, went through with the swing and sends it sailing over long-off for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, mishit? Who cares? It has gone for a six. Maxi, you beast! What power! He looked to have mistimed this full delivery, went for the loft, but the only thing that could have taken that over the long-on fence is his power\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, highest IPL score for {{BATSMAN}}! For a moment, it looked like he would hole out to long-off. Length ball, {{BATSMAN}} walks down the track and lifts it over long-off. It came off the bottom part of the bat, but had enough wings to clear the rope by a long way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the captain did not listen to what the keeper had to say a couple of overs ago. Yes, he pitches it up and then sees himself get muscled over the fence, straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shouts of \"ABD, ABD\" were ringing across Wankhe{{BATSMAN}} and {{BATSMAN}} treats them by dismissing this into the {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket stands. What a strike! Gee. Picked the short {{BATSMAN}}livery early, it sat up well for him too. Easy-peasy as he nails it off the meat and smokes it over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act. Reaches out for a fuller length delivery outside off and effortlessly lifts it over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another six. {{BATSMAN}} gave himself room again, {{BOWLER}} follows him but {{BATSMAN}} still had enough room to clear his arm and dispatch it over long-off again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's into the stands! A loopy delivery around middle, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across, goes down on his knee and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for a massive six. 84 metre maximum that!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dispatched! Short in length around off and {{BATSMAN}} pumps it over the cow corner for half a dozen! Sweetly timed blow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hat-trick of sixes. He's carrying a niggle, but he's hitting them cleanly. Gee, what a turnaround this has been been. Took 11 balls to get off the mark and now he's 82 off 44. Length ball and {{BATSMAN}} blasts that over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a mistime. That's what it was. And it is a crowd catch. The brute that this man is. Gets a pounder on a back of a length climbing up much more than {{BATSMAN}} would have liked but he doesn't bother adjusting. Mows across the line, gets it high on the bat and it the cow corner fence takes the brunt\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, length ball from {{BOWLER}} and it sat up to be smacked, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it and then pummels it sweetly - high and way over mid-wicket for a massive six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 14th fifty in IPL for Faf, and it's been brought up by one of the cleanest, straightest swings of the blade down the ground. Another six that seems to have cleared that diminutive Sharjah roof!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is silly from {{BOWLER}}. You can't be bowling short and wide to {{BATSMAN}}. {{BATSMAN}} stays back and square cuts the ball over deep point fence for a sixer. Easy peasy!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now that is some shot! Don't think many would hit that so far from that length. Not really short and leg stump line, but went back, despite not using the depth of the crease and being cramped, he swivelled and pulled it over the backward square leg boundary and that seems to have cleared the ground. All those gym sessions, that's great flexibility\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lots of flight on this delivery, {{BATSMAN}} clears his frong leg and pumps it straight down the ground for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, greets {{BOWLER}} with a glorious shot. Tossed up delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and times his chip over covers for six more, that's his second one of the night\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed, what more can RCB do? Even muscled mishits are sailing into the stands, a back of a length delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stood firm and then clubbed it over long-on - makes the boundaries look so short. {{BATSMAN}} on fire, RCB look down and out at the moment\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and when the bowler dares to flight, you - on the back of confidence - try it again. This time, {{BATSMAN}} clubs it well over the long-on fence. Too big a hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, some way to get to a half-ton. A pitched up freebie on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} waits on it to swish across the line. Doesn't even bother keeping it down. Flies into long leg. All very nonchalantly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! {{BATSMAN}} is on a roll here. Not many batsmen in the world can dispatch {{BOWLER}} for a six when he nails the yorker but {{BATSMAN}} can! It was very full and was on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in the crease and unleashes the half-helicoper shot over deep square leg for a maximum. Shot of the evening!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, low full toss, didn't dip on the batter and has been spanked down the ground over the bowler's head for a sixer. {{BATSMAN}} didn't hold back there. Mistimed hits from him will carry as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finally gets hold of one! He waited just a moment longer to account for the knuckle ball, and then heaved it away for a flat six. Even this had come more off the bottom of his bat actually, but again, these are short boundaries\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, straight back over {{BOWLER}}'s head. Over the sightscreen. Picks the bones out of this slower {{BATSMAN}}livery, stays till and smashes the ball for a biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a superb shot by Shikhar! Trying to outplay the shots played by Rahane. Goes down on his knee and picks this one up with nonchalance to clear the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whacked down the ground for six. First ball {{BATSMAN}} faces, he leans back and pummels the slower ball. Brings the equation down to 19 needed off the final over. The way this game has gone, don't rule it out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, makes no difference! It won't as well if he continues with this length, {{BOWLER}}. Fullish attacking the sticks, {{BATSMAN}} just shuffles across a touch and sends this flying over deep mid-wicket for a biggie. Another six that had plenty of height on it. Two towering strikes! Perfect start to the over for DD\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, is sweeper in business? No. It has gone all the way. Down the wicket and then cuts it hard and flat over the {{BATSMAN}}ep man's head. For a moment Buttler reckoned he was in with a chance, but it flew over his head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} goes short and {{BATSMAN}} dispatches it over long-on. Went back and flat-batted it disdainfully. The key was - he picked the length early\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a fantastic hook! @136.2km/h, not the quickest or steepest of bumpers, {{BATSMAN}} gets back and across, into the front-on position early, gets under the short one and swivels into a fantastic hook over fine leg for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a biggie! Krishnappa {{BOWLER}} fires a ball right in {{BATSMAN}}'s slot. The skipper, with a big back-lift, swings his bat hard to deposit it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a flat six again. Short of a length on leg, {{BATSMAN}} swivels quickly and pulls it to perfection over the square leg boundary. That went to the fence at the speed of light, none of the fielders had any time to even react\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is now the top run scorer in IPL 2018! What a time he is having! This one wasn't middled well but who cares, it's way over deep mid-wicket for a biggie. Fuller ball well wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} still fetches it to clear the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's like a scoop of butter today. Reads the length so early that he has the time to get under a {{BOWLER}} darter. Lifts it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stand and deliver. Pings the sightscreen. {{BOWLER}} errs by going full and it is right in {{BATSMAN}}'s arc, he latches onto it and dismisses it straight back over {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, exactly what {{BATSMAN}} needed to get himself going. He takes full toll of the free-hit. {{BOWLER}} went off-pace but the length allowed {{BATSMAN}} to flexes those muscles, he powers it over wide long-on. Lot of height and the much needed distance as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fitting finish from AB {{BATSMAN}}. {{TEAM}} are still alive and DD have officially been knocked out. Slower {{BATSMAN}}livery outsi{{BATSMAN}} off stump, AB waits for the ball and lifts this over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} joins the party now! Sees {{BOWLER}} flight the googly, gets as low as he can and smokes it into the cow corner stands for a crisp maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, some more. And more = clean. It's pitched up, but still enough in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} to go further inside to and tonk it neatly into the sightscreen. Also, a personal 50 -- and nothing WWE-like in the celebrations .. aah, someone's grown up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! Just wow! He punches his bat in delight. It was a slower one on a fuller length, {{BATSMAN}} picks it up, delays his bat swing and smokes it high into the sky and over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} finishes it in style. This is the highest ever score by a captain in IPL. He walks off to a standing ovation. We have been witness to a great innings from the Kings XI skipper. Slower delivery that is back of a length, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it and flat-bats it straight down the ground. When he's striking them so well there are no grounds big enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, desperate ducking-hook. Damn fiery bouncer into the head, which {{BATSMAN}} in his attempt to get away from swings his bat mid-way, and surprise, surprise, connects really cleanly, flat and deep over fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oooo, wow. Just wow. {{BATSMAN}} continues dancing, going inside-out, and then holding his pose. Yep, extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gee, this is the shot of the match so far. Could well be the shot of the day. Highest score for {{BATSMAN}} in T20s. {{BOWLER}} bowls a length delivery on the leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} goes leg-side and lofts the drive easily over mid-off and holds the pose for the cameras\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stretches out to reach this googly and then flat-bats it over long-off. Brute power\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, is he a playing a skipper's knock? Reminds me of the knock that Kohli played against Mumbai Indians a few days back. This is a short delivery on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} is onto it in a flash as he middles his pull to perfection. Right over the square leg fence for a flat six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} gets it right into the slot for {{BATSMAN}} who lofts it downwind to clear long-off. The wind was the key here. Don't think he struck it that well but the wind made sure it carried\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, why is Pollard not at long-on? The only man who could have had a chance, but this would have cleared him as well. Currently, it is Nitish Rana who is patrolling the fence. Flatter delivery on the leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} lofts over the top and clears the long-on boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's a 20-ball fifty for Davey {{BATSMAN}}, what entertainment from the Aussie. Greets {{BOWLER}} in grand style. This was the normal offie on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was early into position for the switch-hit and he sent that over the square third man fence. Raise of the bat to acknowledge all the applause. Joint-fastest fifty by a {{TEAM}} player in IPL\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 14 off the over! {{BATSMAN}} has ensured that {{BOWLER}} is not settled. For the third time in as many balls, he comes down the track. It was the googly from {{BOWLER}}, but {{BATSMAN}} made it into a half-volley and bludgeoned it over the bowler's head. A gigantic hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}sanity has started! Stand and deliver from the Queenslander. Right in the swinging arc for him and he lofts cleanly, high and over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, more fun. MORE FUN. A 121kph slower cutter on a length. It's a sin, it's a cardinal sin. {{BATSMAN}} stands like he does, crouched, under it, and slogs over deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, backs away into the on-side, {{BOWLER}} serves one up in the slot, and clobbers this over long-on for a gigantic six! More of these needed. Many more.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, rank length. {{BATSMAN}} lays in, pulling it away, hard, long, cow corner. Such is this pitch, such is this ground, such is I0$ guy, such is I0$ carnage\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}, you beauty! He has given {{TEAM}} the total they were looking for. 24 runs off the final over. Just what the doctor order for {{TEAM}}. It was the slow off-cutter and {{BATSMAN}} picked the bones out of that, waited for it and thumped it over the long-on fence for a maximum. Tom Moody, the {{TEAM}} coach, now affords a smile and has a word with Williamson\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is in sublime touch tonight! Wasn't all that short, but {{BATSMAN}} jumps deep inside the crease and converts it into a half-tracker before muscling the pull over deep square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's getting close to the hundred now. Krishna sends down a length delivery, easy-peasy for {{BATSMAN}}. Just stands tall and dispatches it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh no! Curran has palmed it over the rope. Short and angled across the left hander, {{BATSMAN}} uses the space on offer to play the upper cut to deep backward point, Curran runs across and he is thinking of parrying the ball in even before catching it, in the end he allows it to slip past his grasp\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gets underneath the tossed up delivery and smokes it for a 91-metre maximum over long-on. Gee, that power off the bottom hand...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 10 off 2 balls. This game isn't over yet. Not while {{BATSMAN}} is there. {{BOWLER}} is struggling to execute the yorker. He delivered a low full toss last ball, now a proper full toss at the stumps. {{BATSMAN}} picks it away effortless over long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, does loft over extra-cover really well. Bit of air outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} launches {{BOWLER}} insi{{BATSMAN}} out and gets the maximum. Good end to the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, {{BATSMAN}} breaks the shackles at last - change of pace on this cutter from {{BOWLER}}, but the length was wide of off - {{BATSMAN}} bends down on his knees and pumps the drive over cover - went a long way over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clubbed, the leg-break and {{BATSMAN}} spotted it, gets a good stride forward and heaves it wide of long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, flat and over the fielder at deep square leg. Short and quick on leg, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it and drags it powerfully over the man in the deep, that went like a rocket, lot of bottom hand on that blow by {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, backs away by clearing his legs and then sees the ball like a football to have a clear swing at it. The ball soars over the long-off region for a maximum. {{BATSMAN}} is taking it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gargantuan! More height and enough distance. That was on a length and the batsman dismisses it over long-on for a sixer. Only 67 now off 30 balls as 22 is leaked in that over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, too full, the leverage was there and he has muscled it over the bowler's head for a towering sixer. Massive hit from Killer {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is an unbelievable shot from Ravindra {{BATSMAN}}, even going past the one that Russell hit against SRH. Russell was only about to fall down while reaching for a wide one outside off, but {{BATSMAN}} has proper fallen down but has still managed to club it down the ground for six. This is ridiculous\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, insult to injury! Short of a length around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} stays put and hacks it over deep mid-wicket for a 98m six. There wasn't much power behind the shot, it was the timing that was sublime\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, class! Everything right about this shot. Just a pleasing sight to see {{BATSMAN}} smack a six straight back over the bowler. Fuller and on the stumps, the full face of the bat comes to the fore and then the extension of the arms to send it sailing over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, sails into the crowd. Not the delivery to bowl on this surface - short and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} at no point in time tried to keep the cut down, used the pace on the track and slashed it over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, nobody's getting it right. {{BOWLER}} returns with a full toss, nice and high, and {{BATSMAN}}'s reversing roles. Smokes it into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is a shot and a half. We have seen him dispatch spinners in Test cricket and he is replicating that in this six-hitting format too. He dashes down with a lot of intent, swings hard at it, gets enough bat on it. The timing was incredible, it hit the sweet spot and it sailed into the night sky over deep mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, skids through once again, but {{BATSMAN}} is waiting on the backfoot - very decisive, and he thumps it away over long-on for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, when 11 deliveries have been dot out of 12, you do such things. Like going across the line and sending it well over cow corner for a maxium\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a beautiful shot. On a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall, reaches for the widish delivery and towers it over long-on for half a dozen. No one has treated {{BOWLER}} in such a way so far in the tournament\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, don't tell me he deliberately sliced that all the way for six! Oh he did! Genius! Low full toss outside off stump, not a really bad ball, {{BATSMAN}} has been looking to target third man this innings and he's somehow got under this properly and sent it for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, greets him to the crease with a maximum. Tosses it up, a floppy-hat {{BATSMAN}} plants his front foot forward and launches it over long-off. A blow so meaty that it deserved some extra cheese and french fries to add to it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Bhuvi has taken it. But he has jumped over the ropes. {{BOWLER}} would be gutted! Bhuvi throws the ball in disgust. It was a short of length delivery on the body, {{BATSMAN}} mistimes the pull to fine leg but he gets just enough bat on it to fetch a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a beautiful shot. Class from {{BATSMAN}}. Tossed up leggie outside off, too full and he has knelt down and slog-swept it flat over deep mid. Consecutive maximums for the {{TEAM}} skipper\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, for the faintest moment, all was gone for {{TEAM}}. He backed away to the on-side, waited for the pace-off delivery to reach, and bottom-handed the swat late over long-on for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there's no reason for {{BOWLER}} to flight and be full. Because one time he tries this, he gets lofted over deep extra cover.. inside out. Goes all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clubbed, nicely tossed up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets down on his knees, picks the length early and plays the slog sweep over mid-wicket - hard, flat and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh don't do that. Never do that. A half-tracker to {{BATSMAN}} who chews it up and spits it over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a blow! He takes this leg-break on and hacks it across the line over mid-wicket. Brute power from Colin {{BATSMAN}}. Hits the cushions on the flush\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you can't be slotting in those balls. That was up there, missed the length by a little margin and it was smacked over deep square leg for a sixer. You miss, {{BATSMAN}} hits it out of the park\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, change of ends for {{BOWLER}} and he's greeted in the same way as he was in his first over. Mo jumps out of the crease, gets close to the googly and smacks it flat over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's massive. Such sweetly it was timed. Picks the googly early, gets down on his knee and slog sweeps it over mid-wicket, high and handsome that was\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. It's his comeback game, replaced Tiwary and he's making this opportunity count. {{BOWLER}} gets it too full, {{BATSMAN}} gets underneath it and smokes it a long way over cow corner. Brings up the milestone in some style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a gift from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} thumps it over the rope. A full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} takes a step out and slots it straight back over the bowler's head. Went miles back into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, excellent effort from Rayudu, gets a hand on it, but can only parry it over the cushions. Short ball on off, quick hands from {{BATSMAN}} who upper-cuts it behind square. Rayudu sprints across to his right from third man and flew with his right hand out to pluck, in vain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, top-edge and six, no luck for {{BOWLER}} today. Banged in short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was late on the pull, gets a fat top-edge that sails high and into the stands at long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, a little shimmy down the track, {{BATSMAN}} gets close to the ball, plays with a still head and a straight bat - high and over mid-off, sails over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, first maximum for {{BATSMAN}}. Finds his bearing right this time. Sees a full ball on off, just stands motionless, in fact took a step forward and thumps it over long-on. Doesn't bother to look at the ball at all. He knows it went a long way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, impressive! How well was this timed! Length ball on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} pulls it over square leg for a well timed six. Came right from the meat of his willow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hint of flight and {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes light up. Loads up big time and clears his front leg to deposit into the empty stands over long-off. First six of the innings!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's a slower googly from {{BOWLER}}, which allows {{BATSMAN}} to come down the track and lever it over straightish long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and that has crashed into the demonstration car! Went down on to his knees and slammed the slog sweep flat out of the ground. Cliched but was {{BATSMAN}}tastic\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautifully struck! Turn on this off break but there is width on offer and {{BATSMAN}} does the smart thing, goes with the turn as he chips it over wide long-off. More of an extended defensive push and it goes all the way. Shot of a man in supreme form\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} Ji means business today! He has promoted to number three and he looks in no mood to waste this opportunity. It was an offie on the stumps and {{BATSMAN}} larrups it over long-off for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's lighting it up. Gets the front leg out, loads up, from that massive backlift as he hoicks. Meaty. Long-on. Murder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stunning bit of timing from {{BATSMAN}} and he gets just enough to beat Pollard's leap at long-on. At first instance, it looked like a simple dolly to long-on, the ball kept going and going. Pollard arched back one-handed, got a finger-tip, but the ball was always beating him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 4000 IPL runs for {{BATSMAN}}, this is excellent cricket, tossed up nicely outside off, it was the wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} spotted it early, got a big stride forward, hit it with the spin and into the crowd at wide long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the helicopter is out, MS will be proud of this shot. Length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} waits on it, then brings his wrists into play and flicks it stylishly over mid-wicket, all the way over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, is there a twist? 104.9km/h, a slow length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it and clubs that flat over deep extra cover for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 27 runs off the final over! Poor bowling from {{BOWLER}}. Another length delivery, sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}}, who swings his bat hard and deposits it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautifully played, too full and too straight from {{BOWLER}}, ends up drifting onto {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he prods across, picks up the length and flicks it stylishly over mid-wicket, has enough to clear the ropes on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that should seal it! Full and in the zone and the batsman whistled the ball away into thin air for a maximum straight down the ground. That was a poor delivery, they should have opted for Jadeja\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's an empty cow corner, and KW's exploiting it a little more with his walking-across-carts. Gets behind this back of a length delivery, on top of it as well, in a much smaller smoke\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's into the second tier! H-U-G-E! {{BOWLER}} is extremely young and he's paying the price for inexperience. Still doesn't justify the lengths he's bowling. Middle and leg, in the slot once more and {{BATSMAN}} bulldozes it over long-on. Mammoth hit. Wow!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} connects one finally! This was the slower full-toss from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} backed away, got underneath the delivery and sends it soaring over long-off for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, again shimmying down and going inside-out with this loft over cover. Got right to the pitch and under it. KL {{BATSMAN}}'s good. Real good\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, into the night sky, going..going..gone! Jeez, that was in the air for a long time but guess what, he's got the distance as well! And quite a bit of it too. Length ball, just where {{BATSMAN}} likes it and he swings merrily through the line. Didn't hold back at all and that helped him in the end to take full toll. Into the second tier at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, into the first tier. And a standing admire from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} serves a pie with the short sitter and heaved away. So very typical. Equally friendly bowling here as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}}, his 300th six in IPL, length ball at the stumps, he leans forward and thumps it high and over mid-on, went a long way over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's started to tee off here. {{BOWLER}} misses his mark, bowls a slower ball on a length. {{BATSMAN}} was just waiting for this, backs his muscle power and smokes it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, welcome to the IPL, says {{BATSMAN}}. No respect whatsoever. It was dished out right in the arc just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} freed his arms and opened his bat face at the right moment to clear the in-field. Lost a bit of shape but managed to chip it over point. Superb timing and it just clears the fence for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, biffed away! That goes the journey as it was dragged slightly short. The seam up delivery came on to the bat nicely and was in the arc for the batsman to put it away over deep square leg. {{TEAM}} breaking the shackles?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, off the mark for six. Again tossed up on leg, {{BATSMAN}} this time slog-sweeps and hits it way back over the stands at deep backward square. The crowd getting catching practice\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Dhoni and Smith half-hug in the dug out, Pune's crowd cheers its lungs out. Supergiant beat Gujarat for the first time ever in IPL. {{BATSMAN}} gets a ball sitting up and scythes the ball over square leg. Way over it. With that, it's goodbye RCB from IPL 2017\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's caught, but the fielder has touched the fence in the momentum. {{BATSMAN}} whipped this gift to mid-wicket where Mandeep caught it but at the same time was in contact with the cushions. Needs only one more to complete a fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, tearing into {{BOWLER}} here. 20 off the over already and there's still a ball left. He had gone full at the stumps with this delivery, right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} loft it down the ground for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, why was {{BATSMAN}} held back? Can someone tell me? Such power and timing he possesses. This was more power and the ball cleared Pollard with ease. {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker length and {{BATSMAN}} gets under that, though a miscue the ball still goes over long-on with ease. A rare off-day for {{BOWLER}}, finishes with: 4-0-51-1\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, D-I-S-M-I-S-S-I-V-E! No change of length, in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} whangs it like a fire-cracker over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he is toying with the bowlers now. Stands deep in his crease, spots the short ball early and ramps it over a helpless third man fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is a fine shot! In the slot on middle and leg, a length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} stays put and towers it over long-on for half a dozen, first biggie of the innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, first six of the innings, taken {{TEAM}} 17 overs to smack one out of the park. {{BATSMAN}} gets the perfect length delivery, right in his arc to swing it over the deep mid-wicket fence. Went a long way back\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is proving to be an enterprising knock by {{BATSMAN}}! {{BOWLER}} at its receiving end once again, as the southpaw goes down on his knee and swings it over deep mid-wicket for half-a-dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautiful shot this. Uses his feet and then goes over long-on after getting to the pitch. Hardik was there at long-on but he was left a spectator by the timing on that blow. The {{TEAM}} WAGS are up and celebrating\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, just a little shimmy down the track, {{BATSMAN}} gets close to the pitch of the ball, extends his elbows and lifts it high and over long-off, went a long way into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a monster! Full and right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} to swing his bat hard. Jaddu stands tall and biffs it over long-on for a gigantic six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bashes this short ball into the crowd. Picked the length up so quickly. Leapt back in the crease and pummelled it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what can a bowler do. Bowl, they say. Perfectly good ball from {{BOWLER}} here. Wrong 'un on off stump but {{BATSMAN}} has his front leg out, smacking it over deep mid-wicket with the turn. What have you got, {{BOWLER}}?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, make that two in a row! Another short one and this one drifts into {{BATSMAN}}' pads to launch another maximum into the mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 122.9kph of a filthy nothing. {{BATSMAN}} stays up tall, swinging horizontally. Picks up the empty mid-wicket and a 68-meter hit will do\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that run out doesn't have any impact on {{BATSMAN}}. Gets a juicy toss up in the zone and he hammers {{BOWLER}} clean and straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, uppish and all the way. Scores level! What a hit under pressure. With a boundary through the off-side previous ball and a field set for the leg-side, {{BATSMAN}} knows that the bowler isn't going to bowl outside off stump, so he moves across and flicks this short of length delivery with a strong bottom hand grip to send it clear of the man at fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is looking in good touch, this was banged in short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, doesn't bother to keep it down. He didn't look in complete control - but has enough to send it sailing over the head of the man at long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brute! That's massacred! Maxi is in some form. Watches the ball like a hoop, once he picked the length (short) it was all about connection; that was marmalized, flat and flying over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} gets off the mark with a maximum. A looped up ball, full and in {{BATSMAN}}'s arc. The southpaw stands tall and thumps it over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is a good hit! Slogs with the turn and hits it well over the long-on fence. 91 metre hit that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has looked ultra-positive from the start and this is an effortless hit. He's predominantly a leg-side player and very good with the pick-up shots. {{BOWLER}} tosses it on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} makes him pay. Gets under it and whiplashes it away into the cow corner stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh hello! The best of the lot. Gets down on one knee and slog sweeps this firing in fullish ball into the deep mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 22 off the final over! Third six of the over. Piyush {{BOWLER}} fires another one flat, {{BATSMAN}} expected that. Stayed in his crease, stood tall and hammered it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is off the middle alright! {{BATSMAN}} storm alert! The shorter length and {{BATSMAN}} sits on the back foot to flat bat it straight down the ground. As straight as an arrow and well over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he is in a hurry to finish this off now, is {{BATSMAN}}. Probably not interested in taking this deep. Gets a freebie, slower short ball around leg, doesn't came easier than these with short fine leg in place. He swivels to get inside the line and helps it away down the leg-side with a well-timed pull\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, those wrists have carried this all the way for six. Magnificent timing. He wasn't to the pitch of it even after stepping out, but still went through with the flick over mid-wicket. Plenty of height on it, and enough distance too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is going down with a fight. Short and down leg, {{BATSMAN}} waits before swiveling across and pulling it over long leg. Another huge one from the allrounder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he played an absolute beauty of a shot against Na{{BATSMAN}}em in the last game. Does the same here. Makes room and goes in-to-out - one of the toughest shots in the business but {{BATSMAN}} is a genius, makes it look so simple. Over extra-cover and just crosses the ropes for six. The crowd have gone mad at the Chinnaswamy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's done waiting for something deft. He's down, running, {{BOWLER}}'s gone slower as well for some reason. Swings, big time, and it's more a miscue .. never mind when you've got hands like these. Way over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, did he hit it that well? Got hold of the short ball and just rolled his wrists over that. The ball seemed to have flown away over fine leg for a sixer. Might have been a bit of a top-edge\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slower ball at 112.6kph, on a short of length. {{BATSMAN}} waits, clears the front leg and heaves it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, going, going and gone. No respite for {{BOWLER}} today. Flighted just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends his back knee and slog sweeps it high into the night sky. These Kotla boundaries are not big enough for the Jamaican, for that matter which ground is\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, that ruins the over for {{BOWLER}}, too full and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends down low and slogs it high and over mid-wicket, went sailing into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, make that three in a row! This one's lan{{BATSMAN}}d on the roof! An above-waist full toss - not called a no-ball though. {{BATSMAN}}, surprised by the height of the ball, takes his eyes off the ball, but managed to heave it over long leg. Incredible! Gayle, meanwhile, suggests that it was a fair {{BATSMAN}}livery. Another non-no-ball controversy at the Chinnaswamy?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} clearly has the wood on his England team mates. Stokes in the first game and now {{BOWLER}}. A little shuffle and a crouch down to scoop this length delivery over short fine. The connection was such that it travelled the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is the ball he wanted. A bit of flight from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} gallops down to the pitch of it and lofts it cleanly over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, yea, he's in a hurry. One knee, angry hands and a fierce swing as he swipes it across the line, hammering it flat over long-on. And Kotla's boundaries are no enemy ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 50-stand comes up between the duo with this maximum. Such a clean strike from {{BATSMAN}}. Tossed up at th stumps, {{BATSMAN}} loads up big time and hammers it over the bowler's head. Held his shape and connected it beautifully\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there's six more. {{BOWLER}} may not be feeding it into the slot for him, but {{BATSMAN}} is creating his own length with excellent use of the feet. Gets close enough to this and hammers it back down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a {{BATSMAN}} special! Wow! Slower ball, on a shorter length and not many can generate such power by standing in the crease. Waited that bit longer and unleashed his short-arm jab. Minimum fuss, maximum result\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, down the pitch again, just a clean swing of the willow. Might have read the wrong 'un early, and then used all his might to get the distance, into the stands over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, oh my! Now {{BOWLER}} does a Saini. High full toss that almost took out {{BATSMAN}}'s head, the keeper-batsman does well to duck and swing across the line, the top-edge sails over the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, all smiles in the Delhi camp as the free-hit goes the distance. Touch full on off and it has been tonked right over the bowler's head by {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, puts the seal on it. Crushing blow from Dinesh {{BATSMAN}}. He's offered a good length ball from {{BOWLER}}, sets himself up and drills it over mid-off. Just over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! Really nice cameo this from {{BATSMAN}}. Knew {{BOWLER}} is going to bowl full and wide of off stump, read the slower delivery, got down on one knee and powered this over cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} finishes with a maximum. {{BOWLER}} misses his length and bowls it right in the arc, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and smashes it straight back over. The boundaries straight are not big and it clears 'em with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, caught by the ballboy. Outside the boundary of course. {{TEAM}} needed that. {{BATSMAN}} backs away and picks the slower delivery, lofts well and off the middle of the bat. Just crossed the ropes at long-off and well taken low by the man who is the centre of attraction as the cameras pan to him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a shot. If you miss your length, {{BATSMAN}} will make you pay. Full and zooming on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets underneath it and blasts it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dumped over deep backward square leg! Doesn't take long for {{BATSMAN}} to launch. Gets one that's fractionally short and he is on the back foot in a jiffy. Swivels to absolutely clobber the pull. Went deep into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another tossed up one and Maxi slog-sweeps it all the way over backward square leg. It's on the stumps and Maxi won't miss those. {{BOWLER}}'s having an of day. Tip for you {{BOWLER}}: If you are bowling to {{BATSMAN}}, bowl the away-spinning ones wide outside off stump, hope for {{BATSMAN}} to slog and slice one up in the air\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, excellent use of the feet by {{BATSMAN}}. Tossed up delivery on middle and {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the wicket to pump it over the bowler's head for a biggie, that came right off the meat and met the sightscreen on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the mother of long hops. And {{BATSMAN}} nails his pull, flat and with seemingly enough distance over deep square leg. But Parag's there, and he leaps up, doesn't get to the ball but ends up falling flat over on top of the ice-bucket kept in front of his team's dug-out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hello says the batsman as he was greeted with a short ball. The batsman did not waste time to transfer his weight on the back foot and hammers it over deep backward square leg off the front foot. Terrific hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, on the move, {{BOWLER}} corrects on middle, but {{BATSMAN}}' gone over extra cover. Throws every cell in his body into this hoick\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, into the stands! Premeditated hack and he's got all of it. Nicely floated up by Mo {{BOWLER}} and the next thing he sees is the ball sailing into the mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! This is carnage of the highest level. {{BOWLER}} shouted \"catch it\" but there's no crowd allowed. This was a fraction short and {{BATSMAN}} was quick to pick the length, rocked back and hammered the pull into the deep mid-wicket's second tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} joins the act. Big over for {{TEAM}}, 25 off it and brings the innings back on track. Googly in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} bends a bit and muscles the slog sweep into the crowd near deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, backs away and clears the man at deep extra cover. He went inside out and got enough meat on it to send it packing over the cover fielder's head. Any doubts on {{BATSMAN}}'s powerful delivering skills were quelled down. He didn't time it at all. The batter got it off the outer part of the bat and still enough sinew in it to send it over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely shot, {{BATSMAN}} was in complete control over this pull, banged in short and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swivelled across and pulled it high and over square leg, went a long way over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, COLIN DE GRANDHOMME! Back-to-back sixes off {{BOWLER}} for the New Zealand batsman. Sits on his back knee and wallops the slog-sweep over {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow. Massive strike from {{BATSMAN}}. Bends low on seeing this tossed up, gets into good position and smokes it over deep mid-wicket. Scores are level now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, my word. What was that from {{BOWLER}}? Must have slipped out of the hand. Above waist-height full-toss as {{BATSMAN}} was advancing, it takes the thickish edge and hits the cushion on the full at third man. Only {{BATSMAN}} can play such a shot to a delivery that was threatening to take his head off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whyyy! When those back of a length balls were working so well, why do you want to try the yorker. {{BATSMAN}} smacks it. He did really smack it straight down the ground. Fifty for the {{TEAM}} captain, he's determined and as always confident\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clears his front leg and whacks {{BOWLER}} over long-on. The fielder there seemed interested for a fleeting moment, but {{BATSMAN}} got a decent piece of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brutal, murderous. And it's the first ball that he's faced -- swivelling, pulling, tonking flat over deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, terrific stroke! {{BATSMAN}} is in some serious form and we've seen it already this season. Dug in short and angling into the body, he just shuffles across to get inside the line and uses the pace to control the pull. Easily over fine leg for a biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, long-on would have been interested, but he has to watch it sail over his head. Fullish ball on leg, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and bludgeons it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is in good touch! Not much flight on this ball, {{BATSMAN}} spots it, gets underneath it and lofts it over wide long-on. Right off the meet of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, that's the {{BATSMAN}} we know in the IPL - that's out of the ground, the knuckle ball from {{BOWLER}}, on a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} cleared his right leg and heaved it high and over long-on, 101m on that shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a ridiculous shot. Slices it one-handed over cover for six. Was a near yorker from {{BOWLER}} and gets creamed by {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it was a gamble and it didn't pay off. Darted in on a shortish length, {{BATSMAN}} sets himself up with the front leg cleared, muscles it towards long-on. Maxwell leaps as high as possible, but couldn't even get a finger on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the launch. Can't bowl down leg, not a googly either. Knee, slog, sweep, backward square leg. It's flatly powerful enough to damage a billboard\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} has been taken to the dry cleaners today. Proper pasting. Went too full this time does {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for it. Muscles it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, easy as! That's just a flick off the wrists and the ball has flown away over mid-wicket. A little shimmy down the pitch from {{BATSMAN}} to get close to the ball, picks it away with sumptuous timing. He's been lukewarm so far in the IPL. Can tonight be the night?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clears the fence with ease. How easy he makes it look. It was a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and dispatches it over deep square leg for another six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, a little shimmy down the track, {{BATSMAN}} gets close to the ball and then lifts it nonchalantly over long-on - a towering hit and he's off and running\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! Just wow! You will very rarely see a better power hit than this. It was a yorker on ths stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was deep in the crease and uses his wrists to dispatch it over deep mid-wicket for a massive maximum. Wrist of steel from the younger {{BATSMAN}}!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smoked! That's twice in a row that Delhi have conceded a boundary/six off the last ball. It was turning out to be an excellent over until {{BATSMAN}} decided to use his feet, gets to the pitch of the ball and launches it over wide long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, umm. This looked effortless and it's gone into the crowd. Just a length ball, turning away and {{BATSMAN}} has swatted it over long-on. Clocked 99 meters as if it's body temperature\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, here's another. Shuffled across early, and was able to open up the long leg region. Picked the ball up and bottom-handed it over the ropes there. Just 4 needed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gets underneath this one and lauches it over long-on, picked the length early and was helped with some width on offer\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good end to the over. {{BATSMAN}} hits the first six of the game. He waits for that short of length delivery and picks it off with a well timed pull shot, sails into the crowd near backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! {{BATSMAN}} is on fire here. He's raced to 34 off just 16 balls. {{BOWLER}} serves it fuller and on middle, {{BATSMAN}} moves across and wallops it over deep square leg.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back to back sixes. The length was pulled back and {{BATSMAN}} was waiting on the backfoot, pulls it in front of square and wide of the fielder at deep mid-wicket. He is closing in on his hundred..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}. Full and outside off stump, the ball is turning back in, so the mid-wicket area is a favourite zone for a left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} swings with the spin and sends this all the way - the first six for him this season\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's gone flying into the stands. Greyhounds out of his crease, picks the bones out of it, a Tennis-esque flat-batted smite over wide long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you cannot afford to spray it on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads. {{BOWLER}} just does that and gets punished. He gets inside the line and whips it nonchalantly behind square. Half a dozen!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that ruins the over. Tries to scare the debutant with a short delivery, but {{BATSMAN}} has made a clean connection with the hook shot, got inside the line and used the pace on the ball to place it over fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! He made that look easy. {{BATSMAN}} waltzes down and {{BOWLER}} shortens his length. But there was enough width outside off for {{BATSMAN}} his free his arms. He expertly elevates over the point region and it has enough wings to go all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the slot, a bit of air too, {{BATSMAN}} gets on his knees, and puts all his might into that slog-sweep over {{BOWLER}}ep mid-wicket for six. Didn't seem to time that perfectly, managed to clear it. How does he look elegant while slogging? 50 partnership is up, and it almost hits a car.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 'don't bowl short to me' - {{BATSMAN}}'s body language suggested as {{BOWLER}} overbakes and goes short. {{BATSMAN}} stays in his crease, allows for the ball to come and pulls it with brute force over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is getting a move on. Knew what was coming from {{BOWLER}}, it was the juicy leg-break. {{BATSMAN}} charges out and tonks it through the line over long-off. Archer can only watch it sail over his head for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, rank length ball, released off the knuckles, a massive no-no at this point, and he's carted that over long-on for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} joins the party now. Why should Hardik have all the fun, says the elder brother. Goes down on his knee and smokes it over long-on for half a dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he has absolutely blasted this away! {{BATSMAN}} is hitting them with such ferocity and also clearing the fence by some margin as well. Fuller ball on middle and leg, he was backing away and slogs it merrily over the ropes. Such a huge hit and with such power. Wow!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, goes for the big whammy and succeeds. That was short and has been flat batted over long-on for a huge maximum. Pressure on the youngster\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, doesn't look comfortable doing this, but he's somehow muscled it over wide long-off. Length ball just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} had set himself up by clearing his front leg. Opens his body up and carves it inside out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whoa. Brute. Angry. These bottom hands. These big bats. All in one. Clears his front leg getting it out of the way does {{BATSMAN}}, gets under the friendly length delivery and just jabs it over long-off. The flattest you'd have seen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stands solid inside the crease and pumps this quicker delivery into the long-on stands. Timed!!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full and right in KP's arc, he has no second thoughts. Just dismisses it out of his presence by using those long levers to full effect, sent into the galaxy. Over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't bother wasting any time. Sees a tossed up delivery in his arc, flexes his muscle and tonks it straight over the bowler's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} effortlessly tonks it over long-off for six! Just over the rope...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, why were you sitting in the dug-out, Mr. {{BATSMAN}}! Red flags flying high and handsome in the crowd. It was touch short, {{BATSMAN}} picks up the length early, goes on the back foot and thumps it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} sends it into the crowd. It was an off-spinner from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track, reaches the pitch of the ball and lofts it over the long-off for a maximum. Clean connection!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, great shot. Walks across his stumps, gets outsi{{BATSMAN}} off and then sweeps it almost into the first tier. Sailed a long way into the {{BATSMAN}}ep backward square stands. Is that the strike that gets him back into his fearsome best? Let's wait and watch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, skims over long-off's reach! Picked the googly there, which was overpitched anyway, and hammered it down the ground. Would've been worried for a brief moment, as he hadn't found the elevation, but it's high enough to escape Saini's one-handed leap\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Gabbar unleashes! It is high time they start taking a risk or two. Length delivery right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg out of the way and launches it over the long-on fence. The swing has disappeared and the bowlers need to be clever now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, long stop! Leave the bat regulations alone, they've gotta have some boundary regulations! A 64-meter six! A shortish ball on the hips, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and swat-pulls it half-heartedly, gets a top-edge over the long stop fence for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, pulls and pulls well. With a swivel, picks the slowish short ball and hammers it hard and high into the {{BATSMAN}}ep backward square stands. Sheldon Jackson in the dugout loved that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's Surya-special for you! He shuffles towards the off-side, picks up the slower one, goes down on his knees and slog sweeps it over deep mid-wicket. Into the stands!. Fifty for Surya with this big-hit!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, skips out of his crease, isn't close to the pitch of the delivery but Faf doesn't back out; just goes through with the loft and pings it right over the leaping fielder at wide long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this one has gone the distance! Goes full after bowling a short one, and the batsman reads him to perfection. Down on his knee as {{BATSMAN}} lofts it over deep extra cover for a maxmium\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's been launched! Full in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} and he isn't standing on ceremony there. He certainly isn't. Lots of flight from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes lit up. Huge six down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, tossed full outside off and SKY pumps it for a 73-metre maximum over extra cover, well timed!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's the best he's hit thus far! Stands still inside the crease, watches the full ball dip outside off and creams the loft with high hands, flat for a 82-metre maximum over wide long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 23 runs to cap off the over. Back of the hand slower ball goes awry for Sran. {{BATSMAN}} bent low to free his arms and launched this over deep square leg once again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how well has he hit this! Full and in the slot, he just extends the forward defence into a chip shot and such is the connection that it not only clears mid-off but also the ropes on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh no! Iyer did all the hard work and catching the ball, but the toss up to the incoming fielder goes awry. Similar line and length from {{BOWLER}} and a repeat of a shot from {{BATSMAN}}, smashes it to wide long-off and Iyer races across to his left, takes it over his head but with the momentum taking him over, he tries to flick the ball up for Dhawan. No dice as he ends up throwing it over the ad boards\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} wasting no time whatsoever. {{BOWLER}} pitches it right in the slot outside off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't want any sighters and leans across to dump it into the long-off stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, OOLLLLLAAAAALLLAA! That was a sizzler. Dropped short and the batsman camps back and pulls the ball away into the deep mid-wicket stands. That was powered, muscled and I can go on...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full toss. Talk about ruining a quiet over under the radar. {{BATSMAN}} has his muscles blowing them out of here. 88 meters into the stands behind the sightscreen. And it's a fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} drifts this one wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} gets forward and thumps it back over the bowler's head, all the way for another maximum, 17 from the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the slot and out of the park. Pitched up just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for it, plonks his front foot forward and lifts it over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clobbered over mid-wicket. Stays put, and waits for the ball to arrive, before laying into a delicate bat-swing over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's an extension of punch! Just a mere extension. {{BATSMAN}} expected the googly and hung back to target the shorter boundaries (straight down the ground), timed the stroke to perfection while on the move and cleared the ropes with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 1 off the first 3 balls and 14 off the next 3. T20 cricket for you. Low full toss and {{BATSMAN}} climbed into it. Smoked it over long-off for a sixer. Much needed finish as they scale 150\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back to back sixes. {{BOWLER}} overcorrects by dragging the length back, but {{BATSMAN}} was up for it. In fact, he might have been waiting for it, stands tall and murders the pull over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a great shot by {{BATSMAN}}. Walks down the wicket and flicks the shortish delivery against the turn, the pitch makes it easier for the ball to go the distance, clears deep mid-wicket comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and now he middles it.. into the crowd. Advances down, it's a googly again and this time {{BATSMAN}} picks the bones out of it. Crucially, he went with a straight bat and not across the line. Deposits it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, deposited this into the stands. {{BATSMAN}} means business today. It was a wrong 'un, {{BATSMAN}} reads it late but gets himself in terrific position and launches it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, slower short ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} walks across the stumps and pulls it high and over mid-wicket, went a long way into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full pace feeding the slot -- and {{BATSMAN}}'s camping on the back foot for this precisely, with lovely high elbows on the bat swing to smoke it downtown\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fingertips and Warner has parried one over the ropes. Will it prove costly for SRH? Was a brilliant effort, he was on the move, leapt as high as he could, but managed to only parry it over the ropes - length ball outside off and {{BATSMAN}} pumped it high and over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's the game! Slower ball and {{BATSMAN}} charged down for the swipe over mid-wicket. Was a skimmer and Pandey in the deep showed good awareness as he caught this mid-air in an attempt to palm it back. Managed to parry it as well but the foot touched the ground outside the ropes Just 2 needed now!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cheers says ABD as he accepts the freebie from the bowler. That was a friendly full toss on the sticks and the batsman went across the line to smack the blow flat between long-on and mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clobbered away! {{BATSMAN}} is wasting no time in switching to top gear. Floated up around off, he just clears his front leg and deposits this over the long-on fielder for a maximum. Good proactive batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it is now the highest team total in the powerplay. RCB have found new ways to create records. {{BOWLER}} keeps tossing them up and {{BATSMAN}} sinks to one knee to slog sweep it into the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, excellent use of the feet from MS, comes down the track, gets close to the ball, plays with the turn and lifts it high and over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot! {{BATSMAN}} isn't wasting any time to get going and is happy to target the red-hot {{BOWLER}} who is breathing fire. Short ball that's not high enough, sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} who dismisses it over mid-wicket with a forehand smash sort of pull. Beautifully done\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the partnership between {{BATSMAN}} and Roy is more than 50! Tossed up delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} puts on his dancing shoes and slaugters it over long-on to bring up Delhi's 100 in style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, chance, dropped and six - it's not happening in the field for CSK - Sam Curran, the culprit, this was tossed up slower and wider of off, {{BATSMAN}} had to reach out and didn't get enough on the lofted drive - went flat and and wide of long-off. Curran stretched out with both hands, got to the ball and then let it burst through - was right in front of the ropes and that perhaps put him off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another one-handed six, {{BOWLER}} is getting a serious pasting here. Another length ball on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he was looking to swipe it over square leg, the bottom-hand came off at the point of impact, still it flew high and deep into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 10 off the first two balls. The back of the hand slower one does not come out right for {{BOWLER}}, ends up as a nice juicy full toss for {{BATSMAN}}, who heaves it into the crowd at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed! That has gone around 30 rows back. Back of a length and {{BOWLER}} had become predictable there, {{BATSMAN}} lined up for that length and muscled the pull over deep square leg. That came right off the screws\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just clears Dhawan! For a moment, he was certainly excited but it just about cleared him. The miscued pick up shot from {{BATSMAN}} and he got plenty of height on it. As it panned out, the distance too by a whisker\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is much better off playing conventional cricket shots. Short delivery and at {{BOWLER}}'s pace it sat up for the Australian, who dismisses it with a pull over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over a leaping Samson. The famous {{BOWLER}} knuckle ball on a shortish length, not sure if {{BATSMAN}} spotted it early, went for the pull and the short boundaries helped his cause, over deep square leg for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hammered into long-on! {{BATSMAN}}'s merry ways continue. He is batting on another level now. Slower ball on a shortish length, he just waits for it and slaps through the line. No real effort there, at least not visible but gee the timing, ever so perfect! Another biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, one-handed slap! Wow! Over long-off for a sixer. Tossed up ball and {{BATSMAN}} danced out to canon the ball over the deep long-off fielder's head for a big six. The ball has been kissed by the curse of oblivion as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, high in the air....well over the fence! Booming stroke! {{BOWLER}} isn't hitting the right length, fuller ball outside off and {{BATSMAN}} was already making room for the inside out stroke. Sends this into orbit with that bat swing of his\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, sheer power. That's all made in the gym. What a shot this is. Must be contending for one of the shots of the tournament so far. This is a length ball on off, {{BATSMAN}} went back and used his forearm power to great effect as he flat-batted it dead straight back over the bowler. A flat six. {{BOWLER}} shouldn't feel too disheartened with that hit, it wasn't a bad ball by any stretch of the imagination\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is what he does so well. Those small movements in the crease before the bowler {{BATSMAN}}livers and that puts many bowlers off. This time he backed away and {{BOWLER}} followed him, {{BATSMAN}} swept that high in the air and all the way over {{BATSMAN}}ep backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, right to the pitch after putting his dancing shoes on, wallops {{BOWLER}} into the long-on stands. Easy!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, touch short and {{BATSMAN}} pounces on it. Keeps his head still and smacks it from outside off for a 80-metre flat maximum over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, MS {{BATSMAN}}, far too late in the final over, dispatches this over deep midwicket for six! A {{BATSMAN}} six, and the world goes crazy! My neighbours have gone crazy! Right in the slot and that's carted into the Sharjah streets...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clean hitting from {{BATSMAN}}. Uses his feet, gets to the pitch and extends his bat swing in tonking it over long-on. Stunning timing on that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, superb hit! Adding insult to injury, is {{BATSMAN}}. Charges down on seeing the flight and hoists it merrily straight down the ground. Plenty of elevation and also has the distance as this crashes into the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, into the stands! Clearly the biggest one of the evening. Typical {{BATSMAN}} who nails his pull shot again. Back in his crease as he picks the length early and deposits it over deep square leg for many-a-mile\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, my word. What a blow that is. The weight is on the back foot but he has powered this slower delivery over wide long-on. Looked like he had hit it straight up but it went all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, far too slow for even two bat-swings - 105.2km/h - and this ridiculously slow short ball has been clubbed over deep mid-wicket with a late pull for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ah, the pump. {{BOWLER}} drags his length back, and {{BATSMAN}} makes it worse with his own rock inside. And then adjusts to the scoot in this as well as he crouches, heaves, a long way over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 14 off the first three balls. {{BOWLER}} is predictable and {{BATSMAN}} is toying with him, plants his front foot across the stumps, laps it over backward square, a better connection meant maximum result\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, that should seal this match. This was the wrong 'un from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} spots it early, gets a big stride forward, plays with the turn and smashes it high and over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a little shimmy down the track, reaches out to the pitch of the ball and wallops it over long-on. {{BOWLER}} under pressure, probably for the first time in this IPL\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! That's delicious. The bottom hand power, my goodness. Was a full ball on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} just walked across and flicked it over deep backward square leg. Top shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slowed up just for a change, and {{BATSMAN}}'s no slow coach - he makes room and goes inside-out in a lofted extension of his arms over extra cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, touch short and {{BATSMAN}} sees it early. Camps back and dispatches it to the deep mid-wicket fence. 89 metre hit this\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whoa. Take that. A gallop down the track, inherits the ball right in the slot and just swings the bat all along. A massive swing and lofts it over deep mid-wicket. Several rows inside\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bangs it in short but it's a leg-cutter and it just sits up. {{BATSMAN}} makes room and spanks a flat-batted shot over extra-cover. Woof!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, has he got enough on it? Jusssst. Shimmied down and swung hard, got it close to the bottom of the bat but the muscle behind it was good enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and the last ball has cost 7. Could well cost RCB the match as well. A nothing short ball, around waist high and {{BATSMAN}} has muscled the pull flat into the deep square stands. Looks like he was waiting for the short one, {{BOWLER}} didn't get any shoulder or height on that, Kohli is not happy at all. Suddenly now the equation looks easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fifty for Faf. Picked for the first time and he's grabbed the opportunity. Why were they hiding him? Flighted delivery around off, Faf kneels and smokes the slog sweep into the advertising hoardings near deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, *jumps into a well* This is turning out to be a ridiculously good innings. Unicorns are real, and so are DD chases. Gets a pitched up delivery and slogs it over long-on. No half measures. None at all. Pick the length and swing. Has been so successful so far\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is out of the box quickly and lofts it over mid-on. This white ball surely travels. Goes way into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! That was just an extension of the arms and the ball flies over the fence. For a change {{BOWLER}} goes full, right in {{BATSMAN}}'s arc, he stays rooted to the crease and presents the full bat face to loft it straight back over the bowler. Held his pose for the shutterbugs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is his strength. Anything that is back of a length and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to pounce on it, he uses his reach to good effect to thump it with a straight bat over cow corner. Just managed to clear the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh my goodness, the sound that made! Wow. {{BOWLER}} flights the leg-break up around off, {{BATSMAN}} quickly goes down on the back knee and belts a slog-sweep into the second tier over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} goes full and {{BATSMAN}} slog-sweeps behind square, {{BOWLER}} was doing alright bowling the hard length, {{BATSMAN}} wins the battle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a 145ks delivery no good for all-hands {{BATSMAN}}. Moves a little leg-side and scythes this short incoming delivery over backward square leg. Didn't even rock back fully. Didn't need to\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, tossed up nicely by {{BOWLER}}, fell right into {{BATSMAN}}'s hitting zone, he gets forward and clubs it high and over mid-wicket, went a long way over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, mighty blow from {{BATSMAN}}. So this is why he is denying the single on offer. Backing himself to club a few and does so this time in style. Slightly short and slow from Shardul, pulled away over deep square leg after a slight shuffle. Handy runs these\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Fab stuff. Goes downtown. Moved across a bit, with a clean swing of the bat lifted it nonchalantly over mid-off. Such is the timing that it went sailing all the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is a comprehensive hit from {{BATSMAN}}. And he has deposited it a long way back. It was fuller and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} larrups it over deep cover for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, walks down the pitch and smashes it for a maximum. Just the kind of finish {{TEAM}} wanted and the whole of Delhi camp are delighted on seeing {{BATSMAN}} Sharma get his highest score in IPL. It was straight and short from Jaddu, {{BATSMAN}} ambled down and clobbered it straight back over the bowler's head. Crashed flat into the boundary hoardings...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another one in the zone and this time it's {{BATSMAN}}! Clears his front leg and clouts the length ball over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finally he gets one where he wanted. Down the leg-side and full, {{BATSMAN}} whips over the fine leg fence. Only just clears the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the onslaught continues... Full ball, don't even look back Mr {{BOWLER}}, the ball has gone to Brisbane. Period\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, going, going and gone! That's hugeeeeeeee! And tell you what, he has only used one hand. This is unbelievable power-hitting from {{BATSMAN}}. It was a slower delivery wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} takes it from wide of off, brings his bat down at an incredible speed and launches it over long-on for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, na, na, na, just waited for it to land in his zone. With that sort of a form in CPL, he won't mishit those. Easy to the eye straight loft into the sightscreen. Expect the bowler to push it quick and short?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shot! This is what {{TEAM}} exactly want. Short again on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} stays in his crease and swings it over square leg. Way into the stands, such sweet was the timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fine shot! Short delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} was on the front foot, but quickly transfered his weight back and pulled it behind square. There was a fielder in the deep, but placed it well wide of him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, flat and over the leaping fielder at sweeper cover! Two sixes in a row. Was smidgen short and {{BATSMAN}} freed his arms to slap it over Shami in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's hit the boundary cushions on the full. Was a back of a length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} heaved it over deep mid-wicket for a flat six. Where was this man all these games? Playing his first game of the season and making an impact right away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a shot! {{BATSMAN}} puts on his dancing shoes, reads the googly, gets to the pitch of the delivery and lofts it over deep extra cover for a perfectly timed six. Run fest at the moment! And that has forced Karthik to have a word with his bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gets hold of this one! Finally, {{BATSMAN}} has middled one and sends this way over long-on for a six. Huge strike! Was backing away to make room and {{BOWLER}} shortened the length to help the Australian's cause. Blasted away over the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has a reputation of a clean-hitter, but we haven't seen any of that this season. Picks the right ball this time to play the slog sweep, flighted delivery on off and middle, {{BATSMAN}} went through with the shot and gained maximum result\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, strewn full and into the pads, and {{BATSMAN}}'s picked his area on this. Dispatches this over mid-wicket with a bat swing that suggests many more similar hits. He's hit the purple patch again, if this innings is any omen. 58 needed off last 7\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has found his bearings. Rahman errs, bowls it full on QDK's strong zone. Just bent forward and lifted it through the line. Ah, all timing as it sails over the ropes over mid-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dumped over long-off! This is incredible from {{BATSMAN}}. We've seen this so many times over the years but still, it looks better every time he repeats it. Another horror ball from {{BOWLER}}, widish length ball and it's dumped with that clean bat swing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stand and deliver! Short of a length delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} reads the length early and lofts it over the leaping Maxwell at long-on. He can attack right from the word 'go', hence he's so crucial towards these later stages\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there you go. Picks it off his pads and just hoicks it away with disdain. Waits in the crease and swings his bat at the right time, poppin' the ball over deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over Tahir at deep mid. {{BATSMAN}} slogging the slower delivery and managing to clear the leggie, when he hit it, looked like he holed out. Enough, just about to get a biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, woah. {{BATSMAN}} wasting no time. Gets into the business straightaway. Full on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and whiplashes it over cow corner. Into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this will do. Sinks low, gets under this slower ball and tonks it over the long-on fence for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely shot, a simple extension of his arms and {{BATSMAN}} has sent it sailing over extra-cover. One of the shots of the tourney, on a good length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, plays a check-push and sends the ball soaring over the infield\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh shot! Hit on one leg. {{BOWLER}} tried a similar ball to the previous one, {{BATSMAN}} connects with the pull this time despite being cramped for room and it hits the backward square leg rope on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and there. Crunch. Targets the smaller leg-side, premeditates a sweep, slogging it uppishly, deep into mid-wicket. That should simplify things\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, half-volley and {{BATSMAN}} dismisses it out of his sight. Loads up and launches it over square on the leg-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's the way he plays. Swagger. Saw the revs and lined himself up for the biggie, clean connection and bam it goes over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Nic {{BATSMAN}} in the house folks! Back in his crease as he tonks the short ball over long-on for a huge six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what's in that cricket bat? A slower one on a length, and that's a no-no to the world's best finisher - on his knee and he's mowed that over wide long-on for six! 92 meters!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, halfvolley, dispatched! Loads it up full and bowls straight, {{BATSMAN}} uses those long levers to smack the life out of that leather. All the way over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, typically dragged down. {{BATSMAN}}' smart, he sits, gets it in his slot and heave-sweeps. Checks the railway tracks behind square leg..the ball's there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} gets his man. But, this wicket should belong to McCullum. Hang on! It was a low full toss outside off. {{BATSMAN}} stays in his crease and doesn't get hold of his lofted drive over extra cover. B-Mac at long-off runs to his right and takes a flying one-handed catch. The Lions are confident. The umpires want to go upstairs. Soft signal is Out. Oh wait, did his floppy hat make contact with the rope? Oh, yeah. What a shame! Baz's brim of the hat saves Chris {{BATSMAN}}. The southpaw has a big smile on his face as he comes back. He gets six runs as well. Even, Kohli came and shook hands with the SUPERMAN to applaud his effort. Credit to McCullum for he immediately gestured that his hat may have touched the hoarding. Felt the touching motion\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, {{BATSMAN}} has been in sensational form this IPL and this was a gift from {{BOWLER}}, full and wide of off, lets {{BATSMAN}} free his arms and lift it high and over cover, into the first tier of the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this over compensates for the previous two overs. {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act. It was the googly and {{BATSMAN}} was hitting it against the turn, but still had enough to clear the wide long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed. Down the track and to the pitch of the length delivery then lifts it straight back over the bowler. No holding back from {{BATSMAN}} and he gets the crowd going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he doesn't want to hang around for too long..loopy ball, {{BATSMAN}} sits down and slog sweeps it over deep square leg for a sixer. Only a shot away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}'s balance was shot when he lofted that. His head was falling away to the off-side, but the followthrough of the bat and the timing on that was special. Went all the way over long-on. Just cleared the fence. {{BATSMAN}} picked the off-pace delivery well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, six more to finish the over, ruins the figures of {{BOWLER}}. Puts his dancing shoes on, and despite not getting to the pitch of it, he's able to drag it away over the wide long-on boundary. The key was that he went through with it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finishes it off by pulling this short ball over the long leg boundary, and then calmly tips the bails over. And that's how the IPL 2018 league stages end, with SRH, {{TEAM}}, KKR and RR going through\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bang in the arc. {{BATSMAN}} won't let the rhyme go wrong, he'll tonk it out of the park. Short, full, short .. and yes, too full - which {{BATSMAN}} gets slightly inside the line to and lofts it behind the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} uses the pace of {{BOWLER}}, all 140kph of it, and whips the pull away over long leg. What a brilliant shot. He swivelled across, remained on the front foot while pushing his weight back and used his wrists gloriously\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a high full-toss and {{BATSMAN}} has sent is sailing into the stands - prods across and then brings his wrists into play, came at an uncomfortable height, but he was equal to the task, pulled over backward square leg for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that could have taken a couple of them down in the crowd. {{BATSMAN}} swings. Why not. Length ball, sits up there and {{BATSMAN}} just swings across. \"The big Ben,\" the screen displays\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a nice way to nail your form back. And he exhibits it with some toying around. Just crouches, takes on the line off a length sliding in and swats it flat batted. Such is the timing that it flies all the way too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, over Mayank's ambitious one-handed leap at deep square leg! Was pulled away by {{BATSMAN}}. Short and at 132ks isn't going to threaten him on this pitch. So he swivels, without bothering to keep the shot down and gets it all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, first maximum of the 2019 IPL! It was a fuller length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knees and nails the slog sweep over deep mid-wicket for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the usual suspect. To deal with the mystery spin. {{BATSMAN}} pre-plans his switch. Gets quickly the other way and fetches this off the middle stick to slog-sweep it away over point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} would be proud of that shot. Banged in halfway down and the line was around off, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to transfer his weight onto the back foot and nails the pull over deep square leg. Third six that {{BOWLER}} has conceded\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, not quite as pretty as those Dhoni's bottom-handed whips over long-on but this is good enough. Carries all the way. Takes on the seam-up length ball and muscles it across the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, make that two sixes in two balls for {{BATSMAN}}. This was the shot he attempted against RCB in the previous game and picked out the fine leg fielder. This time he knew the fielder was inside the ring. Moved across his sticks early, stayed low and helped it supremely over the fielder's head for half-a-dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} is greeted with a maximum, dropped it short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and pulls it over square leg, went sailing over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} is not learning. He keeps bowling those slower balls right in the batsman's arc, {{BATSMAN}} sets up with a good base deep in the crease and then swings through the line, straight back over the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, one of the best shots of the day! Short ball at a decent pace, {{BATSMAN}} has no trouble in pulling it over square leg for a maximum. He absolutely middled it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there he goes! First of the night for Dre Russ. Googly and {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for it, it landed right in his arc and he went down on his knee to bludgeon it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} surely picked that from {{BOWLER}}. It was the off-spinner and he played it with the turn, plants his foot across and whips it over the cow corner fence for a maximum. This was more timing than power from the Englishman\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, drifts on leg-stump with this off-cutter and is swept into the stands. {{BATSMAN}}, having picked up the line in a flash, got into a brilliant position there before swinging it over backward square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, this was the slower short ball from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} spotted it early, waited on it and slaps it high and over deep mid-wicket, went a long way into the stands. {{TEAM}} are finishing well here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gosh, that's big from Patel. Way back into the stands. {{BOWLER}} turns one into him this time, Patel goes down quickly and picks the bones out of the slog-sweep. Elevation as well as the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that should relieve the pressure off {{BATSMAN}}, a rank long hop from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and nails the pull over wide long-on, went a long way over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just gets hold. Takes the slog off the front foot, with more height than he'd have liked, but then 77 meters is enough over here, at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's {{BATSMAN}} for you. Banged in short and {{BATSMAN}} smokes it over cow corner. A 81-metre hit. The ideal length for him and he tees off. He's away with a maximum and Warner liked it too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, no sir! Don't bowl there, he'll thrash you even in his sleep. When it's full and that front leg is out of the way, he hardly misses out on the slog. He was down on one knee and smashed this over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 18 off the over! {{BATSMAN}} is shifting gears and has found momentum on his side. Expects the lad to go short and he is sitting deep for that already, clobbers the pull over deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow. This is from {{BATSMAN}}'s refrigarator of awesomeness. Pure class. Drops it a tad short, does {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} is ready for it. Handsomely hacks it behind square, such is the power that it carries all the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautiful, just a lovely extension of his arms, {{BATSMAN}} came down the track, got close to the ball and then let his hands take over - sent it sailing over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that will hurt. The free-hit has gone the distance as {{BATSMAN}} lines up against the short ball and clubs it off the back foot over wide long-on. Sweetly timed maximum. Started with four dot balls and ends up conceding 14. Life's harsh sometimes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the sound of bat hitting ball was like a gunshot. Such a big hit and so well hit too. After not getting to the pitch, {{BOWLER}} seeing {{BATSMAN}} come down, dragged it down, but {{BATSMAN}} is seeing so well at the moment that he goes through with the pull and muscles it over deep mid\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this maximum brings the 50-stand up for the duo. Another drag down delivery from {{BOWLER}}, comes off the final ball of his spell. {{BATSMAN}} sees it early, pivots back and smacks it over cow corner. Feel for {{BOWLER}}, he's bowled so well, just that lost his line and lengths in his last over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashes the roof of Chinnaswamy! Rank long-hop from {{BOWLER}}, just the ball which got rid of Kohli and {{BATSMAN}} in their previous home game. But {{BATSMAN}} is having none of that today. Rocks back and hoists it away over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, straight down the ground from Faf, clean strike. He's got to pick his bowlers now, and he's got 10 off two balls from {{BOWLER}}. Swings through the line of the full ball and sends it soaring over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lapped over the keeper for six! Thrilling stuff. {{BATSMAN}} has stooped across and picked this full toss from middle-stump. It came right off the middle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is in the mood. Mind you, he's not been in the best of forms, but IPL is his cup of tea. {{BOWLER}} dishes a full length delivery and hopes to get away with it, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't allow him to, carves it over long-on for his second maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} just puts enough power in the shot to send it over the ropes. It was in the fuller length zone, perfect length to hit. {{BATSMAN}} goes back in his crease and tonks it over long-on for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's H-U-G-E! Into the top tier! Whoa, what a strike! {{BATSMAN}} has decided to join in the fun as well. Tossed up nicely by {{BOWLER}} and it's blasted high down the ground. One of those sixes that had good height and distance. Lovely\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow. Gorgeuous from {{BATSMAN}}. Brings up the fastest fifty for {{TEAM}} in IPL. Stands motionless and lets his hands do the talking. Extends his arms and lifts it handsomely into the long-on stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, over deep mid. This is the biggest! It's gone outta here. Once again, {{BOWLER}} misses his yorker by a couple of inches, {{BATSMAN}} stays deep in the crease and uses his wrists to send it out of the ground. For those stuck in the traffic jam, watch out!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, connects. Cleanly at last. And then it's going only one way. {{BOWLER}} tries a flipper, but {{BATSMAN}} with his shuffle gets under, sits under and dispatches it into long-on. Nothing subtle\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a similar length, but {{BATSMAN}}'s too smart to be fooled twice in a row. So he walks well across his stumps and pummels it off his legs into deep square leg, 86 meters\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length. Juicy, sitting up length. {{BATSMAN}} plants his leg, hammering it 85-meters into long-off. So damn one-sided\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Dhoni carves a final spot for Pune in IPL 2017. What a 'Sundar' performance. It means beautiful in Hindi.. Anyway, assuming you have let that pass, let's get back to cricket: {{BATSMAN}} finishes by swatting a six over deep mid-wicket, where the fielder almost has it but then dives over the ropes. Nothing matters. Cricket doesn't allow 27 runs to be scored off one ball. Sane cricket, so to say\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is a glorious glorious pull. {{BOWLER}} just stares and walks back to the top of his mark. You do that when you've been pulled off the front foot, and the ball flies over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a 22-ball fifty for KP. He pumps his fists and lets out all the excitement. It was full and right in his swinging arc, KP gets underneath that and launches it many-a-mile over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, chants of \"{{BATSMAN}}, {{BATSMAN}}\". He's looking in ominous touch here. Not all that short from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} went deep in the crease and might have top edged the pull, looked mistiemd at first, but the ball kept gathering momentum as it flew over the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, boom, there you go. Slightly short outside off, and even though it's turning away, {{BATSMAN}} has the room to smack it over long-on. And then the gymnasium and those arms take over. Give the ball wings. Sails over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} comes down on it like a house on fire and dismantles the ball over long-off for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, abysmal start for {{BOWLER}} (sans highlights), a lousy half-tracker, {{BATSMAN}} just swivels into an effortless six in front of deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a hint of flight on offer outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and swings his bat through the line, runs his hands through it in lofting it over long-off for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the Rajasthan dugout erupts. Back of length slower ball, not easy to hit, but {{BATSMAN}} hacks it with stunning power over mid-wicket. Wow what a shot. This should be the blow which seals it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and he's not done yet! Don't bowl full tosses sir! At least not when he's in this mood. {{BATSMAN}} waits for the ball and smashes it over the mid-wicket boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Pollard is flirting with the boundary hoardings today, another crash avoided. A full toss from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} got all of it; he seemed to have mistimed it for a fleeting moment but got enough height on it to get it well and over the leaping fielder at long-on. Pollard tried his best and nearly crashed into the hoardings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, length ball on {{BATSMAN}}'s pads, he picked up the length and swung through the line, got plenty of height and for a moment - Tripathi at deep square leg was an interested party. But the wind comes into {{BATSMAN}}'s aid and the ball kept going - clears him by a distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, my word! Don't drop it there to this lad. On seeing the loop, he gets down on his knees and bludgeons it barrel straight over the bowler's head. Runs raining at KKR's E-DEN\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, my goodness! That was absolutely murdered. A juicy loopy full toss upfront from {{BOWLER}}. There is no way {{BATSMAN}} was missing that. Moves slightly off-side and clouts it over deep square leg. That's colossal\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, for a second the ball seemed to be heading out of Wankhede. But just clears the rope. Slower delivery on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and heaves it to deep mid-wicket. Not off the middle and hence didn't go a long way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, perfect finish for the Lions, but Mumbai Indians will be the happier side. {{BATSMAN}} gets underneath this half-volley and blazes it over long-off. Clean ball-striking!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this will help {{TEAM}}! The skipper tees off and clears the fence with ease. Fullish and in the slot, flatter trajectory helped {{BATSMAN}} as he clubbed it dead straight over the bowler's head. Lovely placement too as you cannot have a fielder there. Not that it would have mattered\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full toss again, you gotta be kidding me. {{BATSMAN}} uses every ounce of his muscular stamina to whip-loft it into mars. Bam!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} {{BATSMAN}}ad to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the last ball of the match has gone the distance! But, Chennai Super Kings face their third straight loss after winning the tournament opener. Gets to the pitch of the delivery does {{BATSMAN}} and thumps it right over the bowler's head for half-a-dozen!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, too full from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} gets un{{BATSMAN}}r it and clobbers it high and over wi{{BATSMAN}} long-on for a mamximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is glorious from {{BATSMAN}}. He wasn't to the pitch of this leg-break, but the timing is still so beautiful that it's gone all the way over wide long-on. The form seems to have come back along with the captaincy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, kaboom! Vintage Yuvi. Yuzvendra {{BOWLER}} over-corrects and doles out a half-volley. Right in the southpaw's slot and {{BATSMAN}} has bludgeoned it straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, half-tracker and goodbye! Cannot bowl such stuff on this pitch, easy for {{BATSMAN}} who rocks back in a flash and deposits it into the stands at deep mid-wicket. Huge hit!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is some statement from {{BATSMAN}}. {{TEAM}} fans are going berserk in the stands. Flighted delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} stays low and pummels it over long-on. Welcome to the attack, {{BOWLER}}..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, KKR bowlers have been too short so far! {{BOWLER}} bowls another short ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} hops a touch and slices it over deep backward point for six more. It's raining sixes at the Eden Gardens, Delhi Capitals off to a flier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, .. and {{BATSMAN}} needs just one ball to continue RCB's torment, flighted delivery at the stumps, he leans forward and smashes it high and over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, missed the yorker and goes for six. Turns out to be a slower {{BATSMAN}}livery, {{BATSMAN}} sits down and slices it over the sweeper, gets enough on it to go all the way. Kohli likes it and roars 'come on'\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, consecutive sixes to end {{BOWLER}}'s spell. This short ball was around leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and plays the pick up pull to send it sailing into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another slower ball perhaps? Patel picks it up and nails it over long-on. He's been hitting them really well today\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that ones with the crowd now. Big hit over long-on there. {{BOWLER}} bowls it a touch slow, and {{BATSMAN}} makes that last-minute room to chidingly loft it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back of a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} knows what is coming, a mini shuffle outside off, forehands it over wide long-off. Carries over the rope, not by much but it will do\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, super shot! {{BOWLER}} was a bit predictable there. Full and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lined up for the loft over extra cover and nailed it to perfection. All the way and a much needed one for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another lost ball? A length ball, the white marshmallow {{BATSMAN}}ceives {{BOWLER}}, as it doesn't move off the wicket, a tad wi{{BATSMAN}} outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, but {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and clubs that high and mighty over cow corner for six! Into the stands!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is so stylish flicked! Stunning hit! Rohit folds hands and looks. Fullish and angled in, {{BATSMAN}} just uses his hands on that to wrist it with a strong bottom hand grip, so easily clearing mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh my god! This guy is playing some outrageous shots. Flighted delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} steps out, gets closer to the pitch of the ball and slogs it hard over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, rocks back, deep in the crease, getting that front leg out once again. And targets the smallest part of the ground - cow corner. And swings. Smoking\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, a hat-trick of sixes, length ball at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and thwacks it flat and hard, wide of long-on for a maximum - worse, {{BOWLER}} has overstepped by a massive margin and a free-hit is coming up\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, top-edge and six! First of the innings and this might get {{BATSMAN}} going. {{BOWLER}} shortens his length and {{BATSMAN}} is through the shot and hence the top-edge, went high and cleared the long leg fence with ease. Small boundaries at Wankhede\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, banged in short, the batsman plays an awkward shot to pull the ball away fine on the on-side for a maximum. He had eyes away from the ball and then the evasive action with the bat coming down on it made good enough contact\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, get outta here, Rishabh {{BATSMAN}}'s bat screamed with delight. Saw the length (short) early and launched this flat over mid-wicket at the rate of knots. Phewfff!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ugly from {{BOWLER}}. Perhaps, took a cue from his skipper. Half-tracker, sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}}. He gets under it and clubs it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's high and it is handsome as well. Not quite off the middle but {{BATSMAN}} will collect another six. 26 runs off the over. Third time this season, {{BOWLER}} has given more than 20 runs. Fullish ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard on his lofted off-drive. Rohit tried his best at long-off, but can't do much. He falls outside the boundary rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that was a miserable {{BOWLER}}livery and {{BATSMAN}} has given it the treamtment it {{BOWLER}}served. It was a slower one on a short of length, {{BATSMAN}} goes on the back foot and pulls it over {{BOWLER}}ep mid-wicket for a massive six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is where he is very strong! On the hips, just a pick up shot and that has gone many a mile over the deep backward square stands. 53 off 37 looks far more gettable\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed! {{BATSMAN}} keeps the boundaries coming for Delhi. He picked the back of a length delivery quickly, got into position and swatted the pull over deep mid-wicket. Clean strike\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short and in his arc. DK swivels a touch and plays the pick-up pull over short fine. All the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how good is that? Pacy short delivery and at the body, what does {{BATSMAN}} do? He just ramps it for six. Using the bat as a help, periscope style. I guess it is Baz who caught that? in the {{TEAM}} dugout. No my colleague - Nikhil tells me Baz has dropped it and he is right\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smacked! {{BOWLER}} misses his yorker by a couple of inches - ends up bowling a half-volley. {{BATSMAN}} moves leg-side, clears his left leg and hoists it over the bowler's head. Bent his back leg and muscled it!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh that's a poor ball. A absolute no-no at this stage, {{BOWLER}} takes the pace off, and {{BATSMAN}} swings through the line, clubs it over long-on for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's toying here. And from Pant's brutal attack, it's come down to {{BATSMAN}}'s delicacy. {{BOWLER}} threatens him with a bouncer, it's off target, it's with width and he carves/upper-cuts it over a vacant third man\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, advances, right to the pitch of the ball and he smokes it for a maximum over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how easy was that for him? Stands tall and nonchalantly lofts the tossed up googly over long-on for half-a-dozen. Pressure on the young wrist spinner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wowza! {{BATSMAN}} sends one into the first tier. Poor delivery from {{BOWLER}}, short without any purpose. {{BATSMAN}} moves across his sticks, gets under it and hammers it behind square on the leg-side. Wonderful!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a horrible delivery. {{BOWLER}} overcooks the delivery and it ends up as a full toss, {{BATSMAN}} does not need a second invitation, deposits it to the biggest part of the ground - to deep mid-wicket. Even some of his team mates were impressed on the distance he got\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, PP starting from where he left off. Short ball, angled into the body, his head stays still as he pulls this handsomely into the crowd. Sight to watch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the short straight boundaries has worked against {{BOWLER}} here. He can't believe it - for a moment, long-off thought it was an easy chance, but he kept watching it soar over his head. Coming to the ball, it was another lovely leg-break, {{BATSMAN}} was completely done in by it, mistimes it badly and still gets a maximum. Who wants to be a bowler in T20s?\n",
            "{{BATSMAN}} {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bowled at 116ks that! The quick hands come down on it like a house on fire and explodes the ball over widish long-on. He tried bowling it quick, the batsman got a length to get under it and muscled it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, proper drag down - as bad as it can get. And it's the googly as well in it, giving {{BATSMAN}} all the more time to read it better - not that he needed it - but then he waits slogging it several rows into deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, {{BOWLER}} misses his mark, offers a length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets underneath it and sends it high and over long-on, hits the roof of the second tier and bounces back into the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, monster blow from {{BATSMAN}}. He'll make a mockery of you if you miss your length. And this is the shot he will play even in his sleep. {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker, sends it into the swinging zone for {{BATSMAN}} and he makes him pay. Gets under it and tonks it powerfully over long-on. That's going, going and goes a long way into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}'s looking ominous. He sizes up this overpitched delivery, gets his front leg out of the way and swings through the line. Clean six into the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, any confirmation needed about what form {{BATSMAN}} has been in? Have a look at this. He's pulled that into the stands, making it look so easy. Short of length over leg-stump, that's usually a very awkward line. But {{BATSMAN}}'s so quick to get outside the line of it and then helps it on its way over fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he is running out of partners but that does not bother him. Finally a delivery that is 141kph and on a length. {{BATSMAN}} gets across slightly to cover the angle as it was bowled round the wicket. Whips the pull over the square leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, maiden fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Raina stands and applauds. Picks the wrong-un and pulls, it was catchable for Nabi at the deep mid-wicket fence, but he was mindful of the ropes behind him, goes reverse-cup and can't catch it. Can't push it back either. {{BOWLER}} doesn't like that effort from his countryman\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and he spoils the over with a maximum. {{BOWLER}} gives a bit of flight, {{BATSMAN}} extends his arms and clubs it over long-on. He had to fetch it from well outside off but {{BATSMAN}}'s got some long levers. Clean strike from the southpaw\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, if that ball had voice, it would have pleaded: \"{{BATSMAN}} please take me for a journey\". {{BATSMAN}} heard that and obliged, rubbish length ball outside off and the next thing {{BOWLER}} sees is the ball flying over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} has had a rare off day today. It was a wrong 'un on a short of length, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and clobbers it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. Gee! He is in fine touch!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's huge! Short length by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it and smokes it over deep square leg for a massive six. Just the kind of delivery he was looking for in order to break the shackles. {{BOWLER}} has just given him that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's gone all the way! How flat he is sending this into the stands?? Wow! Fractionally short and slower in pace, {{BATSMAN}} just swivels and absolutely cracks this pull over deep mid-wicket. He is looking ominous straightaway\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's starting to turn it on now. That's not in the slot, let me tell you. And he hasn't used his feet either. Just plants the front foot down with authority and swings through the line over long-on. Brutal batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, off a knee now. {{BOWLER}} tries going down the brave route - tossing it up - and finds it being slog-swept deeper, longer, cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow!! {{BATSMAN}} is up and running. Similar line from {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} won't miss out this time. Swings hard and connects well to deposit it into the fine leg stands. A huge hit from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the roof has come down at Chepauk. {{BATSMAN}} seals the win with a mighty six. Did I say he's not connecting 'em well? He's just nailed this one. The slower delivery, off-cutter from {{BOWLER}}, right in the arc for {{BATSMAN}}, who waits before teeing off, full swing of the arms and the ball sails over the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length {{BATSMAN}}livery, off-pace as well, {{BATSMAN}} has his weight on the back leg but still manages to slam it over long-off for a sixer. Was sweetly hit. {{BATSMAN}} has to fire tonight for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just grazes Pathan's fingertips at fine leg. Hooks a short ball and wasn't quite in control of it, it loops up and goes flat to the right of fine leg who sprints with his right hand stretched to the maximum. Just can't get there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh what a shot. He's picked the bones out of it. An 87-metre six pumps up the {{TEAM}} {{BATSMAN}}gout while raising the fifty for the South African player. {{BOWLER}} offers it in the slot again, and gets smoked away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, woah! A one-handed six. The knuckle ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was completely deceived for pace as he looked to loft it straight down, the bottom hand comes off but the ball ends up over the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ends the innings in style! Take a bow, {{BATSMAN}}! Phenomenal stuff! {{BOWLER}} loses his length (once more) and sprays this outside off on a good length, {{BATSMAN}} sits deep in the crease and flat-bats this merrily over long-off. What a way to finish! DD end on 219/4!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, tripe. Drags it short and {{BATSMAN}} is so quick to latch onto that. Rocks back and dismisses it way back into the deep mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clubbed, {{BATSMAN}} charges down the track to a good length delivery, didn't look like he got to the pitch of it, still went through with the bludgeon and gets enough to send it over the ropes at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another gift from {{BOWLER}}. Long hop and {{BATSMAN}} had all the time to pick his spot, he rocks back and muscles the pull over deep square leg, just managed to clear the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gets hold of this .. under the length to a fuller-than-usual delivery to smoke it over long-on against the spin\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and this is why - another full-toss and it has been sent into the mid-wicket stands, presses across and then whips it with the bottom-hand, high and long into the crowd - {{BOWLER}} can't bowl such stuff at this stage of the innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, they needed that. They definitely needed that. A nothing ball from {{BOWLER}}, gaining no height on the short of length delivery. It sits up for {{BATSMAN}} and he pulls it away into the stands backward of square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, crikey! We have seen everything from MS in this game. Never will play the big shot off just his second ball, but here he has done so and got six. Down the track to the tossed up delivery on leg, heaves into the deep mid fence. Off the mark with a biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, here's the start. On the pedal. A wrong radar stuff this..down leg. Compounds the misery further with he front leg planted inside the line and then it is business as usual. The flattest of airy-sweeps you'd ever come across\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, they need more of these! {{BATSMAN}} goes across the line, the ball did not turn and came in with the arm, helping {{BATSMAN}}'s swing. Goes well over the cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, told ya! {{BATSMAN}} is making that drop count. Yet another maximum.. Tosses up by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} didn't get it off the middle but still has imparts enough power on it to smash it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, crunched! A 24-ball fifty for KL {{BATSMAN}}. How well has he played thus far in the tournament! Shortish delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} pulls off the back foot, hit flat and hit over the mid-wicket boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{TEAM}} need many more of these, length delivery outside off, that's right in his hitting zone, clears his left leg and clouts it high and over mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the slower ball disappears now! He held his stroke back a bit, the ball chalked the toe-end of the bat and landed well over the cow-corner for a towering, welcoming six for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, for the first time this over, he pitches it up and {{BATSMAN}} goes bam! Gets underneath it and launches it for a maximum over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is in some form alright, comes down the track, doesn't get too close to the ball, allows him a free swing and he deposits it high and into the sightscreen. Another expensive over for the Knight Riders\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, {{BATSMAN}}'s toying with {{BOWLER}}, comes down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it high and over long-on, 18 runs already from the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's sent this to the moon! Oh, my! What a hit! Short of a length, sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}} who clears his front leg and goes booooom! Soaring into the skies at the deep mid-wicket region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has seen enough. Deci{{BATSMAN}}s to take matters into his own hands. Such a difficult shot to play - against the spin to a turning ball, but {{BATSMAN}} nailed the shot to perfection. Down the track and to the pitch before hoisting it long over long-on. Again timed so well and it went way back into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a home-run! Goes for the slower one and concedes six more. {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in his crease and towers it right over the bowler's head. It's raining sixes, literally\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashedddd! Why are you not bowling slower balls {{BOWLER}}? Strange! Length ball, goodbye! You are asking for trouble. {{BATSMAN}} actially felt some pain after launching this over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you can't drop it that short! Mince meat for {{BATSMAN}}. Picks the short ball and slams it over deep square leg for a sixer. Much needed one for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} is being taken to the cleaners. Tosses the googly up and {{BATSMAN}} picked it out of his hand, he went down on his knee and slog swept it with the spin over cow corner. Got plenty of height and the required distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is {{BATSMAN}} at his best. 200th IPL six. Dances down the wicket, gets to the pitch of the delivery and once he does that the rest is easy, lofts through the line and clears long-on comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, #{{TEAM}} make a mockery of RCB's 148, ABD's 46-ball 89, win by 8 wickets with 33 balls to spare. Maxi is blasting it all around the park, puts the finishing touches with a brutalizing maximum over long-off. Got underneath a flat delivery and killed it...Watto smiles as he shakes hands with his dear friend. Lo! That's all he can do at the moment\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, make it 19. Poor {{BOWLER}}'s tried out everything - full tosses, bouncers, length - andhence {{BATSMAN}}ci{{BATSMAN}}s to try out the one thing that remained, a back of a length sitter on the tummy. AB obliges, with a swivel, and a proper hack behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smoked! That's twice in a row that Delhi have conceded a boundary/six off the last ball. It was turning out to be an excellent over until {{BATSMAN}} decided to use his feet, gets to the pitch of the ball and launches it over wide long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, mighty swing of the bat, timing very good, but all too late? Slower delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets down on one knee and lofts it over long-on. Looks like Rayudu isn't happy with {{BOWLER}} for bowling a ball in the slot, earlier he was hinting to the bowling to bowl a bouncer\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over the fielder. Length ball around off, {{BATSMAN}} whips it away and he had the whole of Chinnaswamy concerned for a bit. But they shouldn't have been. Not with those wrists\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, nah. Drops it short, {{BATSMAN}} looked ready and hammers the pull into the stands. Way over the ropes. Lovely, lovely hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, {{BATSMAN}} has sent this ball into the roof of the Holkar Stadium. Banged in short and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, frees his arms and muscles it high and over square leg. This one will not come back, new balls please\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just the perfect over-ruiner. And {{BOWLER}}'s to blame -- letting out a rank short sitter outside off, slow as well for {{BATSMAN}} to line it up as he swivels and pulls it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, scorching hit from {{BATSMAN}}! Prowled down the track in a jiffy and although this wasn't that short, he picked it up beautifully. Propelled it over deep mid-wicket with a shovel-flick. Such power! He's looking ominous tonight again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 24 from the over. {{TEAM}} needed something and {{BOWLER}} has gifted them a perfect launching pad. {{BATSMAN}} is in some form alright. This was tossed up slower and wider outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends down his knees and clubs it high and over long-on, went a long way over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX. Bouncer. Top-edge. Six! Are you surprised? Oh! The bats these days. Big chunk of edge as {{BOWLER}} drops his head in disappointment. Went for the pull did Jos {{BATSMAN}} and {{BOWLER}}' pace took care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} ruins a fine over from {{BOWLER}}. Plenty of width outside off, all {{BATSMAN}} had to do was watch it close and get it over point (no fielders in the deep). He does exactly that by timing his upper cut and slicing the ball over the boundary ropes for a crisp maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} has a wry smile at {{BATSMAN}}. Won't help though. Pace on the ball and off the bat as well. Full on middle, {{BATSMAN}} makes room and goes over cover, hit well and just about clears the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brings the hoick out. The defence was meant only for the first delivery. Spots the googly and decides to let the mid-wicket ropes take the brunt of the hammer once again. Tantalizingly over the fingers of a leaping man right at the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's more like it. Right in the slot and it is a 83 meter six from {{BATSMAN}}. Just a bit of shuffle to off and got nicely underneath the length ball, the big forearms then took over to smash it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bit of TR from Bumble. \"{{BATSMAN}}, {{BATSMAN}}, goes deep.\" is his comment on air. Sheer power from {{BATSMAN}}, waits for the shortish slower delivery, then flat-bats it with brute force and clears long-off easily. The key was knowing what {{BOWLER}} will bowl and setting himself up for the shot. Perfectly executed\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there you go! Overpitched and {{BATSMAN}} latches onto it. Presses forward and dispatches it over long-off for a huge six. Just an extension of his off-drive. Brings up the 50-run stand as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that ain't coming back. Woof! What.A.Strike.Sunil.{{BATSMAN}}. Doesn't move an inch, keeps himself steady and lifts {{BOWLER}} high into the night sky. Way back over the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's Steven {{BATSMAN}} at his very best! Ah, those whippy wrists - International cricket missed you! Shuffles a tad, like he always does, and absolutely smokes it into the second tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, so much power on that. Was a tossed up delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} went down on his knee and smoked it flat over long-off, even a leaping Pollard near the fence couldn't take the catch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, huge blow! This boy is known to hit the ball long and hard, and this is a sample of that. Slot ball from {{BOWLER}}, leg break and {{BATSMAN}} gets down on his knee to slog sweep this over deep mid-wicket. Clean strike and a much-needed blow for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, thumpy thump! What a sin. {{BOWLER}} has overstepped again and one more free-hit for {{BATSMAN}}. Hurls one full outsi{{BOWLER}} off, {{BATSMAN}} plants his front foot across and smashes it flat and hard over extra cover. Such is the power that it carries all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, top stuff. And to imagine this guy hasn't played a FC match yet .. he anticipates the quick bouncer, is quicker to pull it off his shoulder, smoking it so damn cleanly over deep square leg. Punjab > 160\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short again, this time it's all the way. It might have been a googly, but it's way too short. {{BATSMAN}} nails the pull over long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, too predictable from {{BOWLER}}. Another slower ball and the length is way too short, AB had all the time in the world to pick his spot and he marmalizes it into the mid-wicket orbit without breaking sweat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, thumps it straight down the ground. Nothing delivery from {{BOWLER}}, pitches it up and in the zone for {{BATSMAN}}, who extends his arms and goes with a clean bat swing to send it all the way for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and {{BATSMAN}} is in some hurry now! Kneels down and slog sweeps it over the widish long-on region for a sixer. They are racing towards the target\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another one from {{BATSMAN}}! For a fleeting moment he seemed to have mistimed it, but the breeze takes it over the boundary ropes. Fired wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and toe-ends the lofty hit over wide long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, tossed up well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} gets a good stride forward, picks the wrong 'un, opens the face of the bat at the last moment and sends it soaring over extra-cover for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there's the trademark {{BATSMAN}} shot! Flighted wide of off, Yuvi, with a huge back-lift, lofts it handsomely straight down the ground. The long-on fielder moves to his right, can only watch the ball sail over his head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over a leaping Miller! If there was one KXIP fielder who could have gotten to this, it was him but not to be. Drag down from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} launches it off the back foot down the ground. Raw power and just about manages to get it over long-on. Miller leapt high as much as he could but it kept going over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another charge, another bat swing, another boundary. Gets really close this time and has it in him to go straight down again. All in the air this time. All the way this time too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has had enough of the miscues. Backs his power and goes for the biggie. It was a flat length ball, the right-hander stood tall and bludgeoned it over long-on. Didn't worry about his shape, there did {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, unstoppable! Slightly short ball on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} hacks it over deep mid-wicket for six more. Unbelievable hitting this!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 20-ball fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. What a player. What a knock this has been. {{TEAM}} back in the game. Another big over. Flatter leg-break from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} skips back, makes room and murders it over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. He's blown hot and cold this season. Still getting used to the new batting position. Almost a similar delivery that got DK out, but {{BATSMAN}} was able to get under that and tonk it over the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, this is an exhibition from KL, a gentle loosener from {{BOWLER}}, full and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, presents the full face of the bat, high elbow and the ball sails into the first tier of the stands at cover\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dropped and parried over the fence! Nadeem even before taking the catch was looking whether he was about to the touch the boundary. Lucky escape for the left hander batsman. A short ball that was pulled away to deep mid-wicket by him and as a result of {{BATSMAN}}'s mess, he not only gets a life but also a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fabulous shot! {{BOWLER}} gets wicket with this delivery but not that of {{BATSMAN}}. Floated it outside off and tempted the batsman, {{BATSMAN}} keeps a low base, gets low and underneath that to loft it handsomely over extra cover. Goes all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a gift which {{BATSMAN}} accepts with pleasure. Full toss just below the waist, {{BATSMAN}} maintains a low base and helps it along the way, over long leg for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! How did he generate the power? Back of the hand slower delivery, sits up outside off and {{BATSMAN}} still had a lot to do, he forehands the slap over extra cover and it travels the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, touch short and spanked! {{BATSMAN}} is quick on his wheels as he jumps back to thump {{BOWLER}} over mid-wicket. Mighty!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, he's just landed this in the slot for him to power it over mid-wicket. A lot of height on that one and it cleared the fielder in the deep. Oh he's overstepped again! What are you doing {{BOWLER}}!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, goes over deep cover. {{BATSMAN}} didn't find it off the middle of the bat, but has got enough bat to send the ball soaring into the crowd over deep cover. Tough tough shot but {{BATSMAN}} trusted his ability and played it supremely\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you don't bowl length to this lad. Not when he's in form. Clears his front leg and smokes it with superb ease over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, down the wicket and bam! Was nowhere near the pitch of the delivery, but fast hands and power of {{BATSMAN}} takes care of everything. No half-measures. Swung it as hard as he can and got it over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hammered! He is toying with the bowling. {{BOWLER}} is clearly rattled, bowls a juicy full toss as {{BATSMAN}} dances down the wicket, easy pickings for the batsman as he slots it into the crowd at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is a much better shot from {{BATSMAN}}. He backs away, makes room for himself and cuts it over point, connection was so good that it sails over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is awesome. This is so awesome. {{BOWLER}} - one of best T20 bowlers going around - has been effortlessly creamed into the long-off stands. Fifty off just 25 balls for {{BATSMAN}}. Now this should set the cat among the pigeons\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's {{BATSMAN}}-ed! A slower delivery by {{BOWLER}}, on the shorter side and {{BATSMAN}} bludgeons his pull over deep mid-wicket for a flat six. All about power!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gigantic, massive, monstrous! Length ball outside off, a huge no-no in T20, {{BATSMAN}} gets room to swing his arms, and goes through the line, golf-swings that over wide long-on for six. Monumental hit...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over Hardik. The slog sweep and {{BATSMAN}} almost found the only man in the deep on the leg-side, shuffled across and mistimed the sweep towards deep mid-wicket. Hardik jumped but the ball was well over him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! That is some shot. He looks so elegant when on song. Picked the short of length delivery early, stayed on the front foot while transferring his weight back, pulls it handsomely over deep square leg and cleared the field comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, once again the batsman seemed to be done in by the length, but {{BATSMAN}} has still managed to send this one way into the stands at wide long-on. On a good length and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} was backing away on the slog, had to drag it in the end and still gets plenty of bat on it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 28 off the over! It was another off-pace ball from a short of length, {{BATSMAN}} waits and flat-bats it over long-on. The fielder in the deep - Tripathi - jumps in an attempt to catch it. It beats him comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, RJ runs across and palms it over the boundary rope. Hit his thumb - his bowling hand as well. Hope it's not serious. It was a full toss and {{BATSMAN}} hacked it over mid-wicket. Jaddu covered a lot of distance and the momentum was taking him futher across. Stuck his left hand out, couldn't hold on, despite a jump\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is dismissive from {{BATSMAN}}. Off the mark with a maximum. Wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} picked it, went down on his knee and slog swept it with a clean bat swing over long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dropped! How costly will that dropped catch prove to be? Was a shortish delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} pulled it hard to deep square leg where Gill lets it through his palms. Tried to reverse cup it and made a mess of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautifully played, banged in short and angling across the left-hander, {{BATSMAN}} backs away,uses the pace of {{BOWLER}} and helps it on its way, no one in the deep and the ball sails over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the ball is lost! Find a new one. If someone is outsi{{BATSMAN}} the stadium near the {{BATSMAN}}ep mid stands, they can take that as a souvenir. And frame it and keep it for posterity sake. {{BATSMAN}} does a Guptill as he sits down and then does not keep his eyes on the shot, the head looks down and the eyes away from the line of where the ball is going, where's the ball? Over the roof at {{BATSMAN}}ep mid. One hit in the last game came back in from there, but this is isn't. Monster hit! My colleague Akshay tells me that it is a 111-metre six - the biggest of the tournament so far\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, half-volley outside off, clears his frontfoot, and makes it 4 out of 5 balls dispatched for six! Clobbers this over long-off! That's the fifty-stand - only 7 of which have been scored by Dhoni. Faf is in rhythm...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there he goes! Loads up big, gets under this short ball and dismisses it into the deep mid-wicket stands. Into the top-tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, no edges this time. Down the track and over deep mid. Didn't get to the pitch but once it is in his range, he decides to deposit the tossed up delivery into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a googly delivered outside off, not a bad idea. But it's too full, right in the slot, which counters {{BOWLER}}'s thinking. {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and clobbers it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} second guessed {{BOWLER}} there. Waits for the slower short ball and marmalizes it into the mid-wicket stands with zero tolerance...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ooh. It's the googly, and {{BATSMAN}} couldn't care less. He stands his ground, clears his front leg and swings big, lofting it so damn cleanly, with lots and lots of altitude over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, one-handed chip over deep extra cover! Second time that {{BATSMAN}} hasn't quite middled it but has as many sixes to his name. Will this be his night? Was probably undone by the slower ball and got early into the chip shot. One hand came off in the process too but what he did well was to have clarity. Chose to go over the infield and ended up going over the ropes too. Wow!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short ball, journey ball! That has gone into the stands. The batsman does not bother to go on the back foot and pulls it off the front foot. That was a bad bad delivery and the deep square leg region was peppered with the sinews working in tandem\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back of a length delivery, slower again and {{BATSMAN}} is out of his crease, weighed on front foot to whack this out. And he does. Over deep mid-wicket. 22 off 8\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} gets into the act now. Goes inside out over cover. Gets a good connection and the ball has enough legs to sail over the leaping long-off fielder for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bye, bye ball. Margin of error against this man is so less. {{BOWLER}} dares to flight a bit and gets slogged over the deep mid-wicket fence. Well into the crowd with the wind\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, kaboom! {{BATSMAN}} finally times his charge down the track well, gets to the pitch of this and lofts dead straight down the ground. Long-on can't do much as it's well wider and flatter\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, on the sticks, he goes down onto his knees and then the biggest of the night is unleashed as the ball scales some other orbit and disappears out of the stadium. Sensational hitting from ABD and {{TEAM}} have something to fight with\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} likes it there, no spin and slightly short, he sends it into the orbit over wide long-on. So easy. Just makes batting look so simple this lad\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, raining sixes already, we are already in the fourth over. This is the third six of the innings. It's a slower delivery by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it calmly and bludgeons it right over long-on. Off to a flier is Sunil\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this time he does get under the short ball, and absolutely pummels it over backward square. It's his favourite pull shot, and {{BOWLER}}'s lack of bounce isn't going to dissuade him once the length's there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh and he isn't wasting around. {{BOWLER}} tries delaying things with a real fierce bumper, you know, quick, climbing up outside off. But {{BATSMAN}} backs away bigger, swishes outside off and upper-slices .. and Kotla is tiny, really tiny to stop Hyderabad from topping the table\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that has gone flying into the third tier. Just slid on with the arm, {{BATSMAN}} picked the bones out of it, thumping it high and handsome into the long-on stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} fires this well outside off and would have hoped that he's got this out of {{BATSMAN}}'s reach. But {{BATSMAN}} is still able to fetch the slog-sweep comfortably over wide long-on. Amazing shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has found his elements. A short ball without any purpose, sits up nicely for {{BATSMAN}}. He rocks back and muscles the pull over deep mid-wicket. The crowd aren't willing to return the ball. So, the fourth umpire has arrived with a set of replacements\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full delivery angling towards leg, the googly, but {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track and gets to the pitch so fast that he doesn't let it turn. Gets that bat of his down from a high backlift and slogs it into the deep mid-wicket crowd for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good over for DD, 12 runs off it. They need plenty more of it. Slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} picked the bones out of that one, delayed his loft and smashed it straight back over, pinged the ad boardings on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, that spoils the over for {{BOWLER}}, fraction too short and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to latch onto it - rocks back and pulls it high and over mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now 50 for AB. Just a raise of the bat and a glove-punch with {{BATSMAN}} Kock to celebrate getting there. Picks the slower {{BATSMAN}}livery and heaves it into the {{BATSMAN}}ep mid stands. The key was standing still and then going through with the shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, out of the crease in a flash and so was the ball. Tossed up delivery and {{BATSMAN}} charged out to heave it over long-on. Big six. {{BATSMAN}} has put on a show so far\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hoisted. And with sheer timing. A slider this from {{BOWLER}} onto the pads further amplified by a shuffling across {{BATSMAN}}, who picks and posts it over the long leg ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's the confidence he's carrying! On the pads and {{BATSMAN}} helps it over the deep square leg fence. How nonchalant did he make that swipe look like?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, excellent shot! Full in length around off, {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and pumps it over long-off. Back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}} and the crowd is lovin' it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's the pressure releaser. Needed a boundary or something to get himself going. Backed away to leg and got the length delivery right in his arc, swung it away over long-on. Not quite off the middle but still had enough\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, woah! This is a shot of authority from {{BATSMAN}}. Effortless and dominant stuff from the South African. {{BOWLER}} served it up in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} takes his front foot forward and freed his arms, making proper connection to launch over long-on. He's the batsman in form!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, on one knee and launched! {{BATSMAN}} into the 90s. Wanted to have a piece of {{BOWLER}} once more, got down and thwacked him with a slog-sweep over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, much-needed six for {{TEAM}}. Touch fuller from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} crouched a bit low, sets the base and smokes it over long-on for half a dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh my word! How on earth has he managed to hit that so well and so cleanly? This is actually a slower ball very well disguised by {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} was beaten for pace, almost was early into the shot, but managed somehow to reach out and muscle the ball over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, time for {{BATSMAN}} to join in the party! Takes on his Afghan team mate and thumps the floated delivery right over the bowler's head for a clean six, couldn't have played it any better\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow. Just wow. This is sheer timing. Also shows you how good the pitch is. Makes some early room down leg and just chips it. Carries well over the long-off boundary. See it to believe it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}, what a strike! Never mind my comment that they have no real firepower to come. This has been caned over point. Full and wide from Sran, {{BATSMAN}} clatters it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, M-A-S-S-I-V-E! What a blow by {{BATSMAN}}! This over has most certainly sealed the game for Mumbai. Excellent hitting under pressure from these two. {{BOWLER}} errs on the fuller side once more and feeds it right where {{BATSMAN}} was wanting it. He backed away, cleared his front leg and deposited it over long-on for a mammoth six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shot! The only thing wrong with the delivery was it was too straight, on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} stays deep in the crease and picks it up nonchalantly over long leg. He just manages to clear the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes! Sublime wrists from {{BATSMAN}} as he whips it off the pads and sends it sailing into the deep mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a miscue? Does it matter? It continues to fly. More of the sitters from {{BOWLER}} enabling {{BATSMAN}} to get on top of the bounce and he just clobbers it over cow corner. The required run-rate is a mockery now\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, two sixes in the over, just the kind of momentum Delhi were looking for. {{BATSMAN}} was expecting a short ball and {{BOWLER}} gives him what he desired for. The ball skids on, {{BATSMAN}} takes his eyes off the ball and swivels. Gets a fat top-edge that flies over the keeper's head. 14 runs in the over!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} getting some pasting from {{BATSMAN}} here. 14 runs off the last three balls. The intent was fine but the execution went haywire. Banged it short, no purpose on it and allowed {{BATSMAN}} to free his arms. Arched his back slightly and ramped it over the cordon. More off the edge but it went flat and hit the ad cushions on the full. They checked with the third umpire and it was confirmed on the replays\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, just praised his skill of bowling yorkers and guess what, he delivers a full-toss above the waist height. {{BATSMAN}} larrups it over deep mid-wicket for a gigantic six. Free-hit coming up! It wasn't above the waist height so that was a harsh call from the umpire\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and another {{TEAM}} batsman has been denied a century here. This time by his partner but the team wins. Was a floaty delivery and was heaved over long-on for a sixer. KKR were favorites and have been humbled here by a professional {{TEAM}} team, who move to number 4 in the points table\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, unstoppable! Shortish delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} camps back and pulls it over the mid-wicket fence. The fielder near the fence watches it sail over him. Has been the story of the match so far...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, not going to see it off on this occasion. This bouncer is directed at the torso, it was kicking rapidly at him. But {{BATSMAN}} gets his weight back and helps it over short fine leg for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what wrists he has. Played a similar kind of shot against Basil Thampi a couple of games ago. That one flew over deep square leg, this over long-on. A little shimmy and picks the slower delivery, then the wrists take over. Like a flick of a switch, he uncorks those wrists and the ball sails a long way over long-on. No-one else in world cricket can play that pickup shot from the pads as well as {{BATSMAN}} does\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fuller delivery angled across, {{BATSMAN}} lofts it huge over deep cover for a sixer! Lovely hit. The freedom was there for the southpaw and he just opened his arms\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, swept all the way over short fine. Shuffled across slightly to get insi{{BATSMAN}} the line of this off-break, {{BOWLER}} drifted it in on leg to aid the batsman further, and gets swatted into the stands with a powerful sweep shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short ball and six! That was a splendid hit. More of a reactive shot as he looked like he was slightly late on it but that travelled the entire journey. Over the deep square region and {{BOWLER}} takes some more punishment\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, rare loose {{BATSMAN}}livery from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} comfortably smokes it over the fence at {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket. Dragged it short, sits up superbly for {{BATSMAN}} and he takes toll..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that should get AB going, a rank long hop, short and down the leg-si{{BATSMAN}}, AB swivels across and pulls it high and {{BATSMAN}}ep into the stands at backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 20 runs off the over! This is boom boom Sunil {{BATSMAN}}. Gets hold of the slower delivery yet again, it's slower in pace too. Plenty of time for the entertainer to camp back and clobber it over mid-wicket. The crowd has gone berserk\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, third six of the over. This time off {{BATSMAN}}'s willow. {{BOWLER}} hurls it full and in the swinging arc, {{BATSMAN}} presses forward and sends it sailing over long-off. {{BOWLER}} ends with 4-0-52-1 on IPL debut\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} as expected shortens his length, but in the process has over-corrected. A half-tracker, {{BATSMAN}} is quick to jump back and pummel the pull over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's toying around here. The mind-reader reads the slower one and the fullish length on the stumps. Deals with a backing away and a sinking lofted power over the covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} was deep in his crease and he gets himself in a good position and slogs it over deep mid-wicket for another maximum. {{BATSMAN}} is on fire here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, feeds him a revenge gift. Short, on the body, and {{BATSMAN}} swivels, almost base-balling it into the second floor. Where else, but behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is making six-hitting look incredibly easy. Loopy delivery and he unleashes those muscular arms to club it flat over the extra cover fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a nice shot! Banged in short, head-high bumper at 140.4kph, {{BATSMAN}} picks the length early, stands tall and pulls it away with aplomb over deep square leg for a 68m six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shot! This is what the crowd has come for! Tad short outside off and {{BATSMAN}} lofts it over covers for an excellent six. All about timing was that shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, consecutive sixes for {{TEAM}}. {{BOWLER}} missed his yorker by a few inches and is launched into the crowd. Low full toss outside off, {{BATSMAN}} keeps a firm base and carves it over point. Went a long way back into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Hardik Pandya slaps the seat in frustration as he sits in the dugout. Another six. This game has come alive out of nowhere. {{BOWLER}} goes round the wicket, bowls a full toss on the pads and is whipped over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 72 metres maximum square on the off-side. Well, well! {{BATSMAN}} is nailing it. He is treating {{BOWLER}} like a club bowler, hammers him with a throw of the kitch sink on the off-side\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, half tracker and {{BATSMAN}} dismisses it from his presence. Real poor bowling from {{BOWLER}}. Gave {{BATSMAN}} all the time to pick his spot and muscle the pull over the cow corner fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whoa.. {{BATSMAN}}, you beauty. This lad is a very good player against spin and he's showing his class here. {{BOWLER}} doesn't correct his length, floats it up just outside off and {{BATSMAN}}'s eyes lit up once more. Gets under it and whacks it a mile over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed. That's some way to treat a bloke who's bowling at over 140 clicks. Down the track and flat-batted the short of length delivery straight back over the bowler's head. Had enough on it to go all the way\n",
            "San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full toss, you don't want to know what happened to the bowler. That again forced the batsman to crouch low and trample the ball away into the on-si{{BATSMAN}}. That ball almost scaled the moon before it came down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finishes the over with a maximum. Walks down the wicket to get close to the pitch of the ball and then hoicks it over the cow corner fence. Gets the crowd going as well. Good day for {{BOWLER}} in the office, 4-0-25-0\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 10 years down. And {{BATSMAN}} puts up another show. Against the very same opponents. A real drag down and pulls out the agricultural heave in pocketing a half-century with a max over his favoured square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, here's it, again. A big front foot stride that somehow opens the leg-side for this man. Hacks the ball across and popped it away over square leg. Scratch that. Not popped, but bruted\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, looked like a mishit but that has gone for a half-a-dozen. The ball was in his zone and the batsman played the cross batted swipe to tonk the ball away over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, PHHUUUUUU!! 97 metres hit after he sank down on his knee to clobber the ball away towards the {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket region. That was a low full toss and the batsman got un{{BATSMAN}}r it to send it into oblivion\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, moves well across the stumps. And is down on a knee. To execute some more of his slogs. An angry sweep in the air and a dispatch into the stands behind square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has mixed all his frustration and power on that shot. Attempted googly, lands too short for {{BATSMAN}}'s liking, he rocks back and fires it into the stands over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short ball and {{BATSMAN}} seems to have got his eye in. Goes back in no time and times the pull well over the deep backward square leg fence. Goes deep into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh my! That's a {{BATSMAN}} special. How did he manage to time it so well? Looked like he was initially cramped for room, just moved his legs to the leg-si{{BATSMAN}} for a wee bit, somehow managed to get un{{BATSMAN}}r that ball and loft it insi{{BATSMAN}}-out over wi{{BATSMAN}} long-off. Right then, he's moved on to 10 off 5. Good start you would say\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good length ball on leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} whips it gloriously into the fine leg stands. What a pick up! The runs are flowing for Mumbai\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wowza! For a moment, it looked like {{BATSMAN}} had mistimed this but nope, got enough timing on it to clear Shardul at long-off. {{BOWLER}} has his hands on his head. Slowish and serves it outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat and didn't connect it off the middle. Came off the toe-end but such is his power that it sails a leaping Shardul for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, over mid-on again, a much cleaner strike. {{BOWLER}} is drawn towards {{BATSMAN}} down the leg-side, and is bashed through the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you can't bowl short at this pace. And {{BATSMAN}} is a good puller of the cricket ball. Quickly spotted the length, went back and hammered it powerfully over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, oh this is just awful from {{BOWLER}}, not only with the delivery he's bowled, but also that he's overstepped. With third man inside the ring, he bangs it in short outside off. {{BATSMAN}} happily throws his hands at it and whirls it into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is some hitting from {{BATSMAN}}! Slower and short, climbs onto the short ball and muscles it over deep mid-wicket. Another huge hit!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bang into the comm box! There was a cracking sound and it's back into the ground. {{BATSMAN}} has gone bonkers here. In the slot this one and he just extends the chip shot down the ground. Beautifully done and comfortably goes over the fence. Wow!\n",
            "San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, umm, you aren't a cricket binge-watcher if you didn't see this coming. Dropped short, and AB has smacked it into the oblivion. Over {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket. You would envy how early AB sees things, cricket lengths here. Got into the position beautifully and swatted it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, high and handsome! This should get {{BATSMAN}} going. {{BOWLER}} was bowling brilliant slower ones but for some reasons he went for a yorker, misses it and ends up serving it right into the slot for {{BATSMAN}}. He clears his front leg and hoicks it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hundred run stand. You have to ask {{BATSMAN}} how he got under this full ball. Drifted in by {{BOWLER}}, and {{BATSMAN}}'s waited that extra second to nail that loft over long-on. A wristspinner from {{BOWLER}} that!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 29 off the last over! And Mumbai ends the innings in a sensational fashion. It was a fuller length delivery wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} uses his wrists brilliantly again to lift it over deep backward point for another maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is a lovely lofted off-drive, nothing better than this sort of a shot to get going. Length ball, nice pitch to bat on, so {{BATSMAN}} hit through the line and collected a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a tripe length. Short and {{BATSMAN}} has pulled him over deep mid-wicket. No fuss. Looked a six the moment he hit it, unlike that hoick over long leg last over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's how it is done. A banged in sitter and {{BATSMAN}} just stands tall and slogs. Connects right with the middle of his sweet spot and in the only ball he faces gets the ball into the crowds. Over long-on. 159 is what the Sunrisers manage\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} greets the new bowler with a maximum! A floaty delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} waltzes down the pitch, gets close to the ball and pumps it downtown. The sightscreen has to bear the brunt\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cow corner is {{BATSMAN}}'s favourite spot and he dismisses one for a maximum. Krishna misses his yorker, {{BATSMAN}} cleared his front leg and banged it flat, enough timing on it to take it all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and, {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of the free-hit. {{BOWLER}} overpitches one, it's right in {{BATSMAN}}'s arc. The left-hander clears his front leg, bends his back leg and bludgeons it straight down the ground for a 81m six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now follows it up with a maximum. This is {{BATSMAN}} at his best. Googly around leg-stump, that is easy pickings for the left hander, kneels down and sweeps it with a clean bat swing over long leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, switches to the off break and {{BATSMAN}} launches him over deep mid-wicket. Just the length you can swing across\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short ball, the batsman drops down on to one knee and pulls the ball away over fine leg for a sixer. Fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! That was a terrible delivery but what hitting from the burly all-rounder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, might just be {{BATSMAN}}'s night. Even mishits are fetching him runs. This was a short of length delivery at the body, {{BATSMAN}} swivels to play the pull and the top-edge sails over long leg, for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, number 2! {{BOWLER}} is erring in line and {{BATSMAN}} is not one to miss out. This one drifts in on leg-stump, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and muscles it flat over deep mid-wicket. The fielder was left as a spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, deep into the mid-wicket stands. He pounces on this short ball. Picks length up strikingly early, hops back and nails the pull away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} attacks {{BOWLER}} straightaway and gets a maximum. This is going to be an interesting battle. It was a flighted one and was on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} takes a good stride forward and lofts it straight down the ground for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, has that gone the distance? Yeah, of course, it has! Right into the slot around off, slightly up, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles a touch in the crease, gets underneath the length and clubs it over long-on for the first big one of this evening in Dubai\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! That's special. We have seen this before but to do it to {{BOWLER}} after being hit on the head. Hats off! Full delivery just short of yorker length, {{BATSMAN}} crouches down and reverse laps it straight over Buttler, the pace of {{BOWLER}} ensures it goes the distance. Even Smith was impressed with that shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh these bats, modern day cricket, power, so cruel for the bowler. Quickish delivery on the leg stump, {{BATSMAN}} was caught between a sweep shot and a pull shot, but he's somehow sweetly muscled this to clear backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, excellent use of the feet from {{BATSMAN}}, comes down the pitch, gets close to the ball and then launches it back over the bowler's head, brings up his first fifty of the season\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, back of a length and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} was prodding forward, uses the bottom hand and smashes it high and over long-off, has enough to clear the ropes on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, all the innocous-ity. 92kph, dug in half way into the pitch, turning into him down leg too. {{BATSMAN}} waits. And waits. And swivels, rejecting the wide to pull it into fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, booooooom! Cannot bowl it in his arc when he is in this mood. Full and in the slot on off, he just lofts it down the ground effortlessly. Crashes into the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a hit from the younger {{BATSMAN}}. Flighted delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't try to over-hit the ball, just lofts inside out over long-off and timed it sweetly enough to clear the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Koushik is being taken to the dry cleaners today. {{BATSMAN}} joins into the act. Gets underneath this one and dumps it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, an absolute treat to watch him bat. Especially when he gets his timing right. Goes down on his knee early and carves the length delivery over deep point, that's a flat six for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, races to the pitch of the ball and lofts it over wide long-on. {{BATSMAN}} may have the net run-rate at the corner of his eye\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, fraction short and {{BATSMAN}} is quick on the pull - rocks back and pulls it high and over backward square leg, went sailing over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fastest fifty of IPL 2019. This is insane hitting by the six hitting machine. He's turning it on here! Heaves the flatter delivery over the deep mid-wicket fence for a massive six, gets to his half century in style. What a knock!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, connects well this time! {{BATSMAN}} was getting foxed a bit and decides to transfer the pressure right back on the bowler. Tossed up once more but this was in his arc, he lofted straight through the line over the bowler's head. Into the sightscreen. Relieves the pressure a touch for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} welcomes {{BOWLER}} with a maximum. A loopy delivery around off and the shouthpaw has lofted it over wide long-off with impeccable timing, looked a six the moment he connnected that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a special shot! Back of a length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} opened up the off-side by backing away. He generates massive power and biffs it over cover for a maximum\n",
            "Markan{{BATSMAN}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the arc and that's gone! Lovely floater outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, AB gets un{{BATSMAN}}rneath it and smites it over wi{{BATSMAN}} long-off with the cleanest of bat swings you'll ever see\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, off the mark in style. {{BATSMAN}} does not want to hang around. Back of a length and not much wrong with the delivery, {{BATSMAN}} just goes through the line and smashes it over the leaping long-on fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a dramatic photo finish. {{BOWLER}} tries another short one but this time {{BATSMAN}} ain't surprised. Stands up, uses his entire height to good effect and smokes it away. Admiring it as he does so. As flat as the bat motion could get\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, much needed maximum for {{TEAM}}. They have lost the momentum completely. Flatter delivery and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to kneel down and deposit it over deep mid-wicket. Not off the middle but enough to clear the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short {{BOWLER}}livery, sans any pace and the batsman hammers the pull away over the man at {{BOWLER}}ep mid-wicket for a sixer. {{BATSMAN}} has changed gears as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, blimey, what a blow! Some momentum into the {{TEAM}} innings now. This was fired fuller around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} held his shape and swung through the line. Sent it soaring over long-on for a biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, freaky, this is sensational from {{BATSMAN}}, length delivery on off, he makes room by backing away and goes inside out over cover, went all the way over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's been picked up like a bestseller on the shelf. Length on the pads and {{BATSMAN}}'s lovely wrists come into play. Whipped all the way over deep square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 50 up for {{TEAM}} with a maximum! Too hot, too cool. A short delivery down the leg side and {{BATSMAN}} picks it up over deep backward square leg for a flat six. Right over the opposition's dug-out she goes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it has gone for six. A checked loft. Are you serious? Dhawan can only smile wryly, as it loops over his head. {{BOWLER}} deceived {{BATSMAN}} completely, with a slower delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} arrested his shot at the last moment, but it just flew and flew\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is not bothered with a wicket or the break. First ball after the break and he sends it soaring over the fence for a maximum. Tossed up delivery on a fullish length, {{BATSMAN}} just went through the line and lofted it handsomely over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back to back sixes and this was superb. The reverse sweep that goes all the way. {{BOWLER}} pushed it through after being hit over his head, {{BATSMAN}} spotted that and used his pace to broom him away over the third man fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whoa. Absolute carnage. Once that knee bends, things don't stay in this circumference. {{BOWLER}} dishes out full pace but {{BATSMAN}}'s swing is mightier. Smashes the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, poor ball from {{BOWLER}}, drops one short and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and pulls it high and over mid-wicket, has just enough to clear the ropes on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a monster! Fired in on the legs of {{BATSMAN}} and {{BATSMAN}} deposits it into the mid-wicket stands with a heave. That cleared the boundary rope by a long way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, no ball, SIX, my word. What was that from {{BOWLER}}? Must have slipped out of the hand. Above waist-height full-toss as {{BATSMAN}} was advancing, it takes the thickish edge and hits the cushion on the full at third man. Only {{BATSMAN}} can play such a shot to a delivery that was threatening to take his head off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is a high-quality shot. Oh hold on, bat turned in his hand at the point of contact. But the velocity of his bat swing helps him in clearing the fence. It was a pacy delivery on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} takes out this closed-faced whip shot and clears the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just brutally carved through the line. Goes after top-edge width outside off and just like that has managed to get it easily over deep point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's so good with that pick up shot. Plays it in his own way. Stylish! {{BOWLER}} once again bowls the perfect length to lift over the top, the full ball was on the leg as well and {{BATSMAN}} used his lovely wrists to whip it away over the mid-wicket boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fired in flat from over the wicket, angled in, {{BATSMAN}} gets on his knee and throws the kitchen sink at it - flat-bats that over deep mid-wicket for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, going...going...going..GONE! That was in the nightsky for an eternity and yet had enough distance to go deep into the crowd. Clean hit! Full and in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} who just goes through the line with the loft. Didn't seem like he got hold of it initally but boy, didn't he??\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, they have recovered from that tidy last over. Back of a length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} short-arm pulls it over deep mid-wicket, the short boundaries taking care of the rest\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, not off the middle, but it doesn't have to be when it is {{BATSMAN}} Singh. The cross-seamer on off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg to heave it into the on-side, off the base of the bat and over the man patrolling the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, the slower ball from {{BOWLER}}, but the ball simply sat up to be smacked, {{BATSMAN}} made room and clears long-on by a distance - simply stunning from {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautifully played, length delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward, presents the full face of the bat, high elbow and the ball sails over the sightscreen for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, superbly played by {{BATSMAN}}, length delivery outside off, he reached forward, got close to the ball, a clean extension of his arms and he drop kicks it over the long-off fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, runs down, gets close to the pitch of it and smacks it straight down. He's been looking for this for quite some time now, and he really needs this\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, spoils the over by conceding a six off the last ball. Lands it full in the arc for {{BATSMAN}}, he clears his front leg and smacks it over long-on. The fielder seemed in business for a while but it sailed over his head for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is much better. Why nudge and nurdle when you have the shots? {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the wicket and though he wasn't to the pitch, he went through with the loft and it sailed over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how does it matter? He is smashing the ball into the crowds. A half-volley on the pads, he whups it for a 97-metre maximum over mid-wicket. Just compare Raina's score with {{BATSMAN}}y. Tells you that he's in some mood\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, top edgeeee, but fine leg is inside the ring. Wouldn't have mattered though because it cleared the rope. Shortish from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} goes for the pull and gets a thick edge, the bat swing is hard enough for the ball to have enough legs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finally a maximum! The asking rate is up high, the runs weren't flowing and {{BATSMAN}} gets a much needed six. Read the slower ball very early, moved across the stumps and waited for the short ball to come and smashed the ball into the backward square leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} gets in position by clearing his front leg and then wallops it over wide long-on with a clean swing. Ordinary delivery from {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, if Dhawan from other end is changing gears, {{BATSMAN}} decides to up the ante as well. Skips out, {{BOWLER}} gives more flight. KW isn't to the pitch, but still goes through by getting his weight forward. Sends it soaring over long-off. All the way!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 27 runs off the over. {{BOWLER}} has been taken to the cleaners. Drops it short on seeing {{BATSMAN}} move to leg. {{BATSMAN}} throws it bat and smashes it over the in-field on the off-side. Sails over the ropes by a few inches. Just the momentum {{TEAM}} needed at the end of Powerplay\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely shot, {{BATSMAN}} is hurting KXIP here, length delivery on the stumps, he presses forward and thumps it over mid-on, has enough power to pop over the fence on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} powers this slog-sweep to the left of deep midwicket, sending it crashing into the ad cushions. That's hit them on the full. {{BATSMAN}} has come out firing from the onset in contrast to his usual formula\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good length ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} slaps it over extra cover for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, rubbing salt on the wounds. Flighted ball outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes inside out and chips it to perfection over wide long-off. The fielder tried hard, but the ball just cleared the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! What power. It was the slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} had to manufacture all the power, he waited and waited before standing tall and smoking it over long-off, cleared the rope comfortably as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this was coming with Bumrah's quiet over. {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the wicket, gets close to the flighted delivery and smokes it into the second tier near cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short and in the swinging arc, {{BATSMAN}} loads up and hacks it away over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, nicely done! If {{BATSMAN}} gets going, it'll be tough to stop him. Krishna pounds in a shortish delivery. {{BATSMAN}} is expecting that. Stays back in his crease and pulls it over backward square leg with a swivel. First six for the West Indian\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dropped short, poor bowling, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back, very deep in the crease, and pulls it with an elegant flourish high and mighty into the cow corner crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is not good bowling. Dare I say {{BOWLER}} doesn't have the pace to trouble {{BATSMAN}} with the short ball. It's playing into his strengths. And he's absolutely nailing these pull shots\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, first of the game and Chennai need plenty more of this going into the final phase of the innings. Slower cutter on a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} delays his loft and crunches it over extra cover. That came right off the screws and went a long way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's it! How cool is he man! Is he human? {{TEAM}} have won with two balls to spare! Unbelievable stuff. More than 100 runs were needed in about 7 overs but he never showed any signs of pressure, nor did he play rash shots. Just played his trumpcard of taking the match deep and backing himself to finish and boy, what a finish it was. Just a jump across to the off-side and slogs this full ball with all his might to clear deep mid-wicket. This is RCB's first loss defending in excess of 200 at the Chinnaswamy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back to back sixes. Darted at 117kph, on the shorter side as well, that's all too easy for {{BATSMAN}}. Muscled the pull over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ABD kneels and he will eventually bring you down on to your haunches. Stays low, and scoops the ball over fine leg for a huge six. Full marks to the anticipation and execution\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow. {{BATSMAN}} is still keeping Mumbai in the hunt. Pivots back and swats this short ball over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, read the cutter nicely here. Shifted just outside the line of the ball, which is on middle-stump say, and picked it up -- all the way! -- over backward square\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} moves to 99. Spoils a good over by {{BOWLER}}. Pitched up just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} spots it early and smokes it disdainfully over long-off. High and handsome\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's meditative. Pure timing. Uses his feet and times this carom ball over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a switch to over the wicket makes no difference. Pounds it short, pounds it wide and {{BATSMAN}} unleashes the mighty forehand smash. The concrete on the stands taking a real beating here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and now {{BOWLER}} flights. Overdoes it and gives some room as well. {{BATSMAN}} cracks it over the long-off fence. {{BOWLER}}'s wrist looked as if he attempted the googly but it went away from {{BATSMAN}} there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bread and butter for KL {{BATSMAN}}! On the pads and a real loosener that from {{BOWLER}}, lines it up perfectly and swats it into the mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, parried over the ropes for six! Gowtham was standing around 5 yards inside the boundary, stretched his arm out while back-pedaling but never looked like taking it. May have been a different story had he been all the way back. Slower short of length delivery, sits up for {{BATSMAN}} who thwacks it down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and {{BATSMAN}} slams the pull away! Adds a lot of red chilly into the wounds of CSK. Powered over deep mid for a sixer. That was hugeeeeee\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, muscled away! Much-needed release stroke for {{BATSMAN}}. He was crawling along and this should help. Fired flat and on a good length, {{BATSMAN}} was down on one knee in a flash and slog swept hard. Flat over deep square leg for a biggie. Nicely struck\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, first six of the innings! It comes in the 16th over. Better late, than never. {{BATSMAN}} makes room and thumps the fullish delivery right over the bowler's head. Straight into the sightscreen and that's a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}'s half a Yuvraj, 3/5th a Tewatia. Another full toss, and {{BATSMAN}} - as if for fun - just swipes and smashes a hoarding on the square leg boundarys roof. Right, just to make sense: with an asking rate of 18-an-over, {{BATSMAN}}'s done it n half the time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely shot, on a good length and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} makes room, swings through the line and clears mid-on with ease, has enough power to send it soaring over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's getting better as this innings is progressing. Gets down on his knee and picks the length delivery over fine leg. Good enough to reach the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} who swipes it into the stands over wide long-on. 28 off the over. He's killed this game off just like that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} continues to travel.. Throws it up wider expecting to get away but {{BATSMAN}} has other plans, he makes use of the width and smokes it straight back over, not the power of Samson but has enough to clear the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} kock continues his terrific form in this IPL. It was a back of a length {{BATSMAN}}livery on the stumps, not that short from {{BOWLER}}. But {{BATSMAN}} i{{BATSMAN}}ntifies the length early, gets in a terrific position and powers the pull shot over {{BATSMAN}}ep square leg for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finally connects. Was trying since quite some time. Receives a short delivery and {{BATSMAN}} makes sure to camp back and heave it over the mid-wicket fence. Clean as a whistle!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, flicked away for a six. Horror delivery from {{BOWLER}}, very identical to the previous ball. Slanting it on the legs, {{BATSMAN}} ain't missing out on these freebies. Walks across and helps it away expertly over short fine leg. Almost smashed it towards the Harrier car\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slightly slower and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} plays his favorite slog to leg, connects cleanly and it goes all the way over mid-wicket. Can't give him the room to swing his arms\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has taken over the baton after Rahane's dismissal. Runs down the wicket, gets close to the delivery and then uses his power to muscle the ball over the cow corner fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, even better. The gorgeousness of the shots increases in an arithmatic progression. Much straighter this from {{BOWLER}} but once again off a generous half volley length. A seam up and dispatched into the sight screen with a full flowing drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the slot and out of the park. {{BOWLER}} gets his line closer to off, {{BATSMAN}} stays still and biffs it powerfully over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh dear, that simplifies things. A 79-meter six. 19 needed off 11 now. A full toss and that has been bruted over long-on. A full-blooded bat swat and boom, it's outta here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is turning it on here now! He walks down and lifts this shortish ball over mid-off. The ball has enough wings to go into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} breaks the shackles, at first look - he didn't looked to have timed it, but it kept soaring high and into the stands at long-on. Just short of a good length and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} swung through the line and collects his first maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a hit from the younger {{BATSMAN}}. Flighted delivery outside off stump, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't try to over-hit the ball, just lofts inside out over long-off and timed it sweetly enough to clear the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dumped into the stands! {{BATSMAN}} has been promoted to up the ante and he is at it. Makes a hint of room and gets a fuller ball in his arc, smokes it into orbit at long-on. Powerful hit!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is exactly what RCB don't want. That was full and that disappeared. Booming hit over covers for a sixer. Flat and powerful. This landed in the range of the batsman and {{BATSMAN}} drop kicked the ball away. Is there {{BATSMAN}} magic on the cards?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, it's raining fours and sixes at the moment, fraction short and at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and pulls it flat and hard - went sailing over wide long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fifth six for {{BATSMAN}}. He is putting on a show here. {{BATSMAN}} clears his leg, keeps his shape and tonks it over long-on for another six. He is dealing in sixes at the moment!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's another monstrous hit from {{BATSMAN}}! Shimmies out of his crease and smokes this well flighted delivery into the cow corner orbit with a dash of swagger\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, continues his fun tira{{BATSMAN}}. Keeps getting nothings on the pads, sitting up to be smacked. Obliged. Fiercely swatting into {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, chipped all the way! Superb stroke from {{BATSMAN}}. Sat deep in the crease and didn't try to overhit this one. Just hit through the line and stressed on timing more than power. Served him well as it's cleared the ropes at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 23 off the over! Wow! Universe boss is on fire! {{BOWLER}} delivers another slower one, he is not learning from his mistake. It was on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it and unleashes it straight down the ground for another six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} flights it up and AB immediately clatters him over long-off. Just got the length wrong there. It was a bit too full outsi{{BATSMAN}} off. Still, it's a superb shot as AB had to reach out\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, highest score for {{BATSMAN}} Sharma this season. He spots the slower ball that is on a short of length and smacks it away over deep mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a six and a half! That ball is gone into the sea of reds in the cow corner region. That was a slower {{BATSMAN}}livery and {{BATSMAN}} spotted it like {{BATSMAN}}ad meat after giving the charge and picked the bones out of that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow wow wow! The helicopter has crash landed into the hearts of DC fans. That was a superb blow. Stays deep in his crease, and those steely wrists take the ball over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} shortened his length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} backs away, makes room and slaps it over cover. The timing is good and the ball sails over the ropes for another maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, my word, what power down the ground. Short from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} thwacks it straight back over long-on. It's off the back foot too. Stunning\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gets one out of the screws, finally! Gets into position early against the short ball and hammers the pull flat into the mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Mumbai need more of this. A dragged-down delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} has all the time in the world to hang back and swipe it over deep backward square leg. Brute force from {{BATSMAN}}..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} is almost forced to bowl it closer after the call, gets into {{BATSMAN}}'s arc and gets nailed over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, into the stands! {{BATSMAN}}sanity at the Eden today! It was fuller and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it and larrups it over deep mid-wicket for a mighty six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, third maximum of the over! {{BATSMAN}} has gone bonkers. Walks down the track and makes room as well, {{BOWLER}} continues to err on the shorter side and this disappears as well. Way into the crowd at cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a big one to get off the mark. Puts on his dancing shoes, gets to the pitch of the ball and deposits it over long-on for a massive six. Was middled and timed to perfection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how well has he hit that? Boy! He is having some fun out there. Skates out of his crease, wasn't quite to the pitch, but why bother? He swung it handsomely over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, but that is not the way {{BATSMAN}} thinks.. Anything with flight and in his arc, {{BATSMAN}} will go for it, through the line and with a clean bat swing sends it soaring over the long-on fence, into the second tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, second hundred this season, mighty Hash has done it on the big stage! Gets a handshake and a hug from his skipper. Cross-seam full delivery wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} goes inside-out over extra cover. Crunnnnched off the meat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's two in two now. {{BOWLER}} under the pump. Errs again, hurls in a similar delivery. {{BATSMAN}} was ready for it, waits for it and absolutely clobbers it over long-on again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a brilliant hit under pressure. {{BOWLER}}, why did you run in and bowl a full ball in the slot? He followed {{BATSMAN}} who was backing away, but landed perfectly for {{BATSMAN}} to tee off over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, six to end. Shuffles across and inside the line, too predictable, slower delivery again, {{BATSMAN}} swings it to the deep backward square leg fence. No-one there and anyway it has the legs to go over the fence. {{TEAM}} end with 175\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 25 off the over! Not the start the debutant would have hoped for. The pressure got to him and he darted a full ball on the pads. Easy pickings for {{BATSMAN}}, who flicked it over backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's it. Gujarat Lions win their first game of the season. {{BATSMAN}} goes deep inside the crease, expects pace and envelops it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, welcome to your new spell says {{BATSMAN}}! Length ball wide of off allowing {{BATSMAN}} to free his arms. He is balanced in the crease and elevates it straight over long-off for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a clean strike by {{BATSMAN}}. Skipper versus skipper and the younger one wins the contest. Takes on Ash and thumps the floated delivery right over the bowler's head, straight as an arrow and over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slower ball in the slot for {{BATSMAN}}. Doesn't move an inch, just pumps it for a clean maximum straight down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the result of that deliberation is a short ball at the body. It's brisk from {{BOWLER}}, but {{BATSMAN}}'s sharper. He's onto the back foot quicker, swinging the pull over fine leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's dealing in sixes at the moment, third for him. Drifting in from the round the wicket angle, {{BATSMAN}} swings through the line and smokes it all the way over wide long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX .. aaand Delhi make it to the top two, for today at least. Rajasthan get knocked out, officially. Everything courtesy yet-another {{BATSMAN}} slog, the usual, sitting on a knee and smoking it into the first floor at cow corner. Oh also, he has his personal fifty\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finally {{BATSMAN}} connects with one and sends it into the crowd. Floated up just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} sinks to one knee and slog sweeps it over deep mid-wicket. GG certainly didn't like it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} takes full toll of the free hit. Length ball right in the slot for {{BATSMAN}} to clear his front leg and tonk it over long-on. If Pollard can't do anything about it, there's nothing anyone else could have done. Good start to the over for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has mixed all his frustration and power on that shot. Attempted googly, lands too short for {{BATSMAN}}'s liking, he rocks back and fires it into the stands over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, keep calm KKR and accept the Murphy's law! They have been annihilated here. Loopy ball and has been banged over deep mid with the help of a slog sweep. {{BATSMAN}}, like he did against CSK, finishes off with a sixer\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a behemoth, gosh. Third six off the over. {{BOWLER}} bowls it full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} bends his knee and lofts it handsomely over extra cover. All grace, elegance and class. Go watch a smooth wave caress the shore, this is that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the slot and goodnight! Fuller in length and {{BATSMAN}}y likes it, tonks it many-a-mile over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a huge six! Slightly short ball and {{BATSMAN}} treks back to smoke it over deep mid-wicket. Could have been a six on any ground. Just the kind of shot {{BATSMAN}} was looking for to cut loose\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 'what a way to bring up the fifty,' shouts D Morrison on air. {{BATSMAN}} skips down and lofts {{BOWLER}} with the turn over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and now a full toss to cap off the misery. Swings across the line and sends it over the deep square leg fence. Went high and handsome\n",
            "San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, carves it over extra cover. AB waits patiently now, it's another one of {{BOWLER}}'s slower balls that sits up on a length. And boom, and the virus has saved someone in the crowd from a broken nose\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stand and deliver! Uses those Popeye-esque arms to smash a pull off the front foot, sheer power! It has gone flying into the mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} moves into the 80s. {{BOWLER}} bowls length - a crime at this stage and AB slogs it over cow corner for another sixer\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive hit! Makes a dent on the ad hoardings on the roof. Right in the arc - length delivery and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg and heaves it all the way over long-on. Needs to play all the six balls\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just clears long-on! He didn't get all of it, having to fetch it from outside off, but there was enough power in those shoulders\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and now one better. Swivels this time, and deposits the short ball over long leg this time. Game slipping, or has it already?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this guy and his timing. Reads this short ball early and waits on the back foot. Pulls from there into the deep square leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it only gets another twist. Spoke too soon. Converts a wide length ball into one in the arc with a run across his stumps. And then it is his swing that takes over. Hacks it across the line and despite the top-edge the big bats ensure it flies into the stands over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, got out to a half-tracker in the previous game, but not this time. Rocks back and manages to beat the fielder at deep mid-wicket by quite some distance. Wasn't in complete control of this pull, but the timing was good enough to go the distance, and it was also the shorter boundary that he targeted\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full toss in {{BATSMAN}}'s arc and out of the park. Takes his right leg out of the line and sends it over the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Mumbai {{BATSMAN}}'ed at home. Slow ball sitting up and martyed over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a way to get off the mark! Wide half-volley and at Sharjah of all places, that's gotta go. {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and lofts it cleanly over long-off. It's gone for a mammoth six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, excellent cricket from {{BATSMAN}}, banged in short and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} got on top of the bounce, used {{BOWLER}}' pace and helps it over the lone slip, went all the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short of length delivery around the hip, and if there's anyone you don't want to bowl this length at, it's {{BATSMAN}}. Whips the pull away into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, well he's been waiting, and he reminds us that he can tonk them around too for fun. Dances, swings, deep, long, game, set, match\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and he celebrates with some more. More of the charges down, more of the swings through the line. The zone of having fun here\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed. Over deep mid. Picks the slower delivery and then smears it powerfully over mid-wicket. With all his body weight going into the shot. Sends the RCB-pro crowd into delights of joy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes for {{BATSMAN}}. It's raining sixes here in Hy{{BOWLER}}rabad. It was a good length {{BOWLER}}livery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} clears his front leg, keeps his shape and tonks it {{BOWLER}}ep into the mid-wicket stands for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, drops it short and into the body, but Faf picks the slower one - waits for it to arrive and clubs the pull over deep midwicket for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length ball at 123kph. {{BATSMAN}} trusts the bounce, gets into a good position and dispatches it over mid-wicket. Off the sweet spot of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that has gone out of the Chinnaswamy! And might have lan{{BATSMAN}}d on something or someone outsi{{BATSMAN}} the ground. What's AB's reaction - stoic! Again his tra{{BATSMAN}}mark shot, sit down, move across, a juicy full-toss and it has been sent over the {{BATSMAN}}ep backward square leg roof. A souvenir for someone to take home. Chants of \"AB\" echo around the ground as the players wait for a fresh cherry. Meanwhile AB and Moeen Ali have some refreshments\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, incredible shot! Wasn't a bad ball by any means. A short of length delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} stayed in his crease and went downtown. Thumps it over the bowler's head for half a dozen. It was on the stumps and {{BATSMAN}} generated all the power from the crease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, deposited into the crowd. {{BATSMAN}} moves across a bit, gets inside the line and swings it with the spin over backward square leg. Made decent connection as the ball sailed 20 rows back\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it has gone for six despite it coming off the bottom of the bat. Again a bit too full from {{BOWLER}}, in the hitting range and {{BATSMAN}} tees of. Over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is a brave ball, but {{BATSMAN}} is a good player of spin and he loves the slog-sweep. Landed full and {{BATSMAN}} went aerial over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, reminds of that night in Mumbai. Flat-batted pull on this back of a length delivery. Does not go high in the air, almost goes flat to the deep mid-wicket fence. So much power behind this one\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, a little shimmy, {{BATSMAN}} gets close to the ball and lifts it nonchalantly - wide of long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 128.8kph, slower ball on a shortish length, sits up nicely. {{BATSMAN}} walks across, waits for the ball and pummels it over deep backward square leg with a pull shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is into a parallel universe from the universe boss. Length ball was like a dead meat and {{BATSMAN}} picks the bones out of it. Over cow corner for a mighty six. That was poor bowling\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, did someone say the boundaries are bigger? Not for this guy. {{BOWLER}} feeds him another back of a length delivery and the Mumbai skipper has smoked it over deep mid-wicket for six more\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, steps out close to the pitch and launches it down the ground. May have come close to the bottom of his bat, but there's still enough for a 74-metre six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he is a small man but when he hits them, he certainly packs a punch. Short of length delivery angled across off, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep inside the crease and pulls it over deep mid-wicket. Flat and all the way. 50-run stand and 150 up for {{TEAM}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ahh, the new DD captain doesn't think so. What a way to greet the mystery spinner in his new spell! Floated up around off, {{BATSMAN}} did well to go with the spin and executed the slog sweep beautifully. Easily over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, super shot! He is picking his deliveries and time to attack the left-arm spinner. {{BATSMAN}} dances down the wicket and gets close to the ball, swings it with the spin over deep mid-wicket. This came right off the screws and went a long way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot - made it even more special as he was done in completely by the flight. {{BOWLER}} saw his coming, slowed down the pace, dragged it wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} reached out and slaps it back over the bowler's head, all the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a stunning shot! That's gone a long way back. His highest score in IPL. Picked the length (short) early, got into a good position on the back foot and muscled the pull over deep square leg. Right off the meat of the bat. Picked it up beautifully\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, for a fleeting moment AB seemed to have mistimed it. Wasn't to be. AB was moving to the leg-si{{BATSMAN}} but {{BOWLER}} kept it wi{{BATSMAN}} of off, bowled it on a length and ma{{BATSMAN}} AB fetch; carved off the bottom half but no problems, it keeps traveling and sails over the leaping sweeper cover fiel{{BATSMAN}}r\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this was right in the slot and {{BATSMAN}} ensures it is dispatched. Flighted outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} had the width to free his arms and he smacks it straight down the ground, clearing the sightscreen comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, low full toss. {{BATSMAN}} stays crouched, gets under, and boom. Swinging slog, into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, sensational pick up shot from {{BATSMAN}}! Treats {{BOWLER}} as a spinner here by walking across and just drop kicks it over {{BATSMAN}}ep square leg. Beautiful connection\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's been palmed over the ropes! Mavi, the fielder. Was a slow, flighted delivery. Slightly too full, {{BATSMAN}} goes hard on the lofted on-drive and doesn't time it too well. Mavi moved to his right and probably didn't time his jump well. Gets a hand, but that's been parried away. SIX\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh what a shot! The quicker delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} slogs really well and the timing is exceptional, sails into the second tier over the mid-wicket boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he is playing the innings of his life in the IPL. Gets a six off the first ball of the over- doing it the Kohli way. Holds his shape, clears his leg and smashes it down the ground for a six\n",
            "San{{BATSMAN}}ep {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, width again. {{BOWLER}} doesn't bother changing his approach, something AB's read well in advance to slap over point this time\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the slog-sweep from {{BATSMAN}} and he has sent it over Morris' head at deep mid. Right in the range for that shot and {{BATSMAN}} sent it into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's picked the bones out of the slower one, and it's clear why - 75.5km/h, off the back of the hand, and it was so slow, he could have swung once and swung it again in time. Decides to wait, and clubs this over long-off for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is playing a gem here. He is getting the big hit at the right moment. The slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for it with a crouched stance, gets underneath it and nails the pull over deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this lad is known to hit massive sixes. 143.2kph, {{BOWLER}} misses the yorker, {{BATSMAN}} stays deep in his crease, gets under it and bludgeons it over the bowler's head. The sightscreen has to bear the brunt..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, consecutive sixes for {{BATSMAN}}. He needs to kick-on, at least to get his form back. Wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} had to fetch it from outside off, cue-ends the slog sweep just over a leaping Searles at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 50 for {{BATSMAN}}. He is getting tired and losing some of his power, but this he sits back and waits for it to be bowled short, then mauls the pull over deep mid. Third six of the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, second ball and {{BATSMAN}} takes {{BOWLER}} to the deep mid stands. The trademark {{BATSMAN}} slog-sweep, as soon as he saw a bit of flight on that tossed up delivery on off, bent down and clattered it. Nice way to get off the mark\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is dealing in sixes. {{BOWLER}} has a wry smile on his face. Down the track and to the pitch before lofting this clean over long-off. The fielder was just a spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, chips down the track and lofts it huge down the ground! Superb hit from {{BATSMAN}} as he wants to have an early finish\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, half-tracker from round the wicket, flat one, {{BATSMAN}} whacks it high and mighty over deep mid-wicket for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, collects a six as he gently sweeps over square leg. Nicely on a length from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} meets it with good timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, terrific shot! It was a slower delivery, {{BATSMAN}} deals with him like he'd treat a club bowler. Waltzes down the ground, gets to the pitch of the ball and bludgeons it over long-on for a flat six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, excellent shot to end the over. He can do this, doesn't matter if Lynn is back to the pavilion. Gets sight of the loopy delivery, sets under it and smokes it right over the bowler's head. In fact a tad to his left, but it's a clean strike. Long-on is a mere spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fuller one on off, {{BATSMAN}} gets low, makes room and throws his hands at that to loft that over long-off for six. Massive hit. Great start to the over for {{BATSMAN}}. A bit of a slice, but with these kalyug bats, the meat is much bigger\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, that should break the shackles for DD, too full and in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} extends his arms and lifts it high and over long-on, Rohit was a mere spectator as the ball sailed over his head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there's a man at deep square, but he is just left ball-watching. Floated up into the pads, PP uses those lovely wrists to send the flick aerial over square leg. Sheer timing. Nothing else\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 26 runs off the final over as {{BATSMAN}} ends on a scintillating 128*! Walks back to a standing ovation as he muscles the full toss over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clubbed, {{BATSMAN}} comes with a reputation and he gets his first six of the IPL - back of a length and just outside off, he clears his left leg and hammers it high and over mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, into the second tier. {{BOWLER}} is predictable with his change of pace and {{BATSMAN}} was waiting for it, cleared his front leg and smashed it straight back over the sightscreen. Mumbai need plenty more of this\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} nails this one into the crowd. The slower ball from {{BOWLER}} drifted into his hips, sat up to be put away, and {{BATSMAN}} flogged it a long way over long leg. Don't think we're getting the ball back. Someone's taking it home. Ball change required\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} goes the distance! Pitches this one on a full length around off and {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knee to pound it over long-off, over the fence comfortably\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's gone all the way! {{BATSMAN}} is taking a liking to {{BOWLER}}. Charges down the track and knows that the length will be shortened. Adjusts to pull it over deep mid-wicket. Easily over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and he does. Rightaway! A rank long hop, {{BATSMAN}} sits back and clobbers it a countrymile over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slower ball bouncer, sits up nicely for the right-hander and {{BATSMAN}} deposits it into the stands. The ball doesn't rise as much as {{BOWLER}} would have liked it to. {{BATSMAN}} stands tall and pulls it fiercely over deep square leg. {{TEAM}} have crossed 160\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} is being taken to the cleaners. 14 runs off the first three balls. Pitches up, just where {{BATSMAN}} was hoping for. Gets under it and thumps it over long-on for a maximum. Just clears M Ashwin, who was patrolling the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the track, makes room as he did so and goes high and over long-on, went a long way into the stands. Watches in admiration as the ball kept going and going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the punch. The pose. Gets the length right in his slot, loads, shows up the full face and tonks it straight down. Talk about the lack of respect\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed over long-on! Huge test this for {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} is in the mood to destroy him tonight. Loopy leg break and it's too full, launched down the ground for another huge biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a much needed six. {{BOWLER}} is brave enough to toss it up, {{BATSMAN}} kneels down and fetches the slog sweep from outside off, smacks it over long-on and has the crowd going again\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, launched!! Slightly fuller and in the arc for {{BATSMAN}}, he stays low and smokes it into the stands over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, comes down the track and launches into the lofted hit, gets good height and the desired elevation over deep mid. Clears the fielder\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length ball angling into middle, {{BATSMAN}} lays into that slog-sweep on the up and sends that into the deep mid-wicket orbit for six! Boult takes a phenomenal catch there -- leaping and reverse-cupped -- but the momentum has him going over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stand and deliver! A tossed up delivery on middle and off, {{BATSMAN}} gets it right into the slot and thumps it over long-on for a huge six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shambles, follows up with a full toss, {{BATSMAN}} ain't sparing those. Gets under it and murders it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, when it is tossed up, {{BATSMAN}} will look to play over mid-wicket. That's his signature shot. Sit down and then slog-sweep the spinner. Connects beautifully and loops over deep mid\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the McScoop! Ridiculous batting. Saw him do this to Tait who was bowling at the speed of light in a T20I - if I'm right at Eden Park, New Zealand - when he made a hundred. He just put off Tait that day with some unbelievable shots. This he sets up a good base, takes the full-toss from middle and ramps it over Ishan Kishan's head. All the way too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, more in the slot, more of the obvious slower ones. {{BATSMAN}} can line it up, swing, and hoick downtown\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed. Over deep mid. Picks the slower delivery and then smears it powerfully over mid-wicket. With all his body weight going into the shot. Sends the {{TEAM}}-pro crowd into delights of joy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's how you cash in. Something for Billings to learn. 95kph slower delivery and {{BATSMAN}} picked the bones out of that one, delayed his shot and that allowed it him to send it sailing over long-on. That gets the crowd going as well\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, woah! Has he launched this one into the moon or what? What a shot. 97-metre hit. Length ball in the slot for {{BATSMAN}}, {{BATSMAN}} set himself and whacked it with ferocity, behind square on the leg-side and into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, sheer power from {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} helped his cause with a long hop, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and flat-bats it back over the bowler, deep into the stands at long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, one over too many for KW - Warner had to complete the fourth over from his fifth bowler- but this is going the distance. Tad too full and well outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out and slugs it high and wide of long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full ball on middle, {{BATSMAN}} gets his front leg out of the way and belts it over long-off. Not a clean contact, but this isn't the biggest ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a massive shot! No doubt, it's {{BATSMAN}}. Slightly short, {{BATSMAN}} sees it and is quick to jump back in his crease. Pummels the pull into the deep mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} has actually bowled a full toss way outsi{{BATSMAN}} off stump, but that big back and across movement of {{BATSMAN}} helps him easily time this kind of sweep shot over backward square leg. He's just awesome to watch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, huge over for {{TEAM}}, this was another slower ball and DK picked the bones off it. Gets well forward, uses his wrists to good effect and whips it high and wide of long-on. More problems for MS and CSK\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, MAAMMAAAMIAAAHH! The Big Show has arrived. The showman lays the bat on that and crunches that over the man at long-on. That scaled many a light years before coming down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's in the crowd! Typical powerhit from {{BATSMAN}}. He will go after it from the word go. This was the bouncer, leg stumpish and he got inside the line to help it over fine leg. Into the second tier\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't reach the pitch of the ball but he still goes through with the shot and connects well. It was a flighted delivery at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} comes down the track and lofts it over cover with the turn for a six. He hit it inside-out, one of the hardest shots to execute. Ball hit the ropes on the full and umpires are confirming it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, conventional, leg-lined, but {{BATSMAN}}'s smarter. Clears his forward leg, steps away too and then swings. Into long-on's first floor\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, blame the willow, if you are a bowling fan. Or call it a beautiful display of timing, if you support the batters. A gentle chip on this shortish ball where {{BATSMAN}} looked deceived for a while. But manages to clear the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slower ball and smashed, {{BATSMAN}} danced down the pitch and slogged at this, didn't catch the middle of the bat but caught enough to clear the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, first six of the evening. {{BATSMAN}} is underway. A high full toss served to him and {{BATSMAN}} just about manages to put it away. He lofts it over mid-off. Didn't get it off the middle, but doesn't matter as it had enough wings to hit the boundary rope on the full\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 20 off the over. {{TEAM}} are making the most of the powerplay. Once again, it's in {{BATSMAN}}'s swinging territory, he clears his front leg and lifts the ball back over the bowler's head for a stunning maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, picks the bones out of this googly from {{BOWLER}}. It was tossed up generously and as soon as {{BATSMAN}} picked it, he decided it was going in the stands. Heaves it way over long-on. It was right in the slot too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, succeeds this time! He reaches out for the dragged slog and then biffs the ball down the ground to send it rocketing 20 rows into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, some salt into the open wounds being garnished in by {{BATSMAN}}. The ball was short but {{BATSMAN}} was tall enough to smack the pull away over cow corner. He wants a quick finish\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, mauls this slower {{BATSMAN}}livery over long-on. Ma{{BATSMAN}} slight room to the off-pace {{BATSMAN}}livery and then freed his arms to go big. Connected cleanly and there was never a doubt about the hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! Floated up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} had the width to free his arms and he made no mistake, lofts it high and over the long-off fence. Almost nailed the electronic scoreboard\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fabulous shot! This for me is the shot of the innings. The leg-cutter on a length outside off, {{BATSMAN}} plonks his front foot forward and lofts it over extra cover. The power he generated on the slower ball was ashtonishing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is fantastic hitting from {{BATSMAN}}. He is being aided by some poor bowling too. Half-volley and it's a pacy ball, {{BATSMAN}} drills it dead straight down the ground. Into the sightscreen for another maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has belted this one. Geee! He is in amazing touch. It was a nicely flighted delivery wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} dashes down and larrups it against the turn over long-on for a maximum. The connection was sensational and it sailed over!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, how good is his bat? Or is the ground? Whatever it is, six runs in {{BATSMAN}}'s account. Was a slower delivery on middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} waited for it and flicked it over mid-wicket. High, handsome and just over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's all the amount of respect {{BATSMAN}} had in the tank. He loves spin. As soon as {{BOWLER}} bowled a little full, he went down on his knees to power it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, banged in short and just outside off, Karun was early into the pull and nailed it high and in front of square on the on-side, went soaring over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slower ball this time, and all the way. He's tearing into {{BOWLER}} here. Picks up the change of pace right off the hand and whips the ball off middle and leg into the deep mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you will see those often especially when {{BOWLER}} is bowling at such pace. {{BATSMAN}} is not afraid, goes for a pull off the front foot, gets a fat top-edge that flies over the third man fence. Blades these days! I tell you..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} has run out of ideas! {{BATSMAN}} moves miles away from the leg stump and the bowler tries to follow him. Goes full though and the batsman goes inside out to clear covers with this exceptional shot. Wow!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's the first one by {{BATSMAN}} tonight. Was a shortish delivery around off and {{BATSMAN}} cleared his front leg to club it nonchalantly over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, flat six! That barely left the ground. Banged in and at {{BOWLER}}'s pace it sat up for Watto, who was quick to rock back and nail the pull in front of square, right between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bring out the helmet folks! {{BATSMAN}} gets underneath this full delivery and tonks it over the deep mid-wicket fence for another massive six. It's raining sixes!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, for a moment, I thought that he had mishit that. How wrong was I? Pitched up delivery outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out, bends the back knee and lofts it over long-off. High and handsome. A six off the free-hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} making RR pay for the drop catch. {{BOWLER}} is slower ball is right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} delayed his shot for a second and hammered it with a clean swing over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has seen enough. Decides to up the ante and succeeds. Lowers his stance to reach the ball, unleashes his strong muscles and thumps it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is now officially a carnage. {{BOWLER}} goes wide of off-stump and {{BATSMAN}} was happy with that line, good stride forward and lofts it with the spin over extra cover. Another one out in the car park\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the release over that {{BATSMAN}} was searching for! Short and wide, {{BATSMAN}} loves the ramp and the geographical details of the Wankhede allow him to as well. The ball really travels here and the ball clears the third man fence quite easily\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is why {{BATSMAN}} is here! It was another slower delivery from Krishna, {{BATSMAN}} walks across and uses the long levers to excellent effect. Powers the pull over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Chawla in action again and this time he parries it over. Misjudged it completely. {{BATSMAN}} charged down and threw everything at the back of a length delivery, sliced it towards sweeper cover and Chawla ran forward to take the catch, got fingertips to it and parried it over. Had he stood his ground, it was coming straight to him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and again. Much cleaner, much bigger. The Kings XI dugout is on its feet as {{BATSMAN}} finishes the over off with back-to-back sixes. Puts his dancing shoes on again and swings through the line of the delivery\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a cracking cut shot from the little man. {{BOWLER}} bowls a 135kph short ball, {{BATSMAN}} is an excellent player of the cut shot, he deliberately cuts hard with an open face and hits over backward point, it's good enough to go all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another nonchalant strike over long-on! He makes it look ridiculously easy. The key is that {{BATSMAN}}'s head is so still while hitting through the line. Once the ball is full, he simply gets a small stride in, keeps his balance, and plays an extension of the on-drive\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} is letting it through like a sieve here. Very full ball. Too full, {{BOWLER}}. And {{BATSMAN}} makes room and hedgehops him flat over his head. 39 off {{BOWLER}}'s 3 overs so far\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, high full toss, and whacked with disdain. {{BATSMAN}} doesn't even bother looking up after flat-batting this into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hammered, tad too short from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across and muscles the pull - high and over square leg for a maximum, turning out to be a big over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, such a talent! Goes inside out, plays with the field and lofts the pitched up delivery over deep extra cover. Raining sixes in Abu Dhabi!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, someone shouted 'catch it!' from the KXIP team, maybe he was referring to whoever was there behind the sightscreen because this was always going to be a six. {{BOWLER}} overcooks and it's slower too, {{BATSMAN}} reaches it and goes through the line with a clean loft\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's almost a seam-up delivery from {{BOWLER}}, but he's landed it way too short and {{BATSMAN}} parks him into the crowd. He uses the depth of the crease well and pulls it over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, KP is upping the ante now. A risky shot, but he generated enough power to clear the ropes. A 76-metre six. Short ball wide of KP's off-stump, he fetches from there and hacks the pull over long-on. Manoj Tiwary was interested for a bit, but that was always travelling\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, sits back and smites a half-tracker over wide long-on, he is making the most of his luck today\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length delivery and has been driven on the up! What a shot! Has lifted the ball away over long-off for a sixer. This might be the game changing over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX .. and he'll finally get his cover-chip-drive right, getting under this length and tonking it over long-off rather comfortably. Clearly SRH couldn't care less, in fact Warner's even celebrating while the ball's in trajectory\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is flying at the moment. First ball against {{BOWLER}} and he launches him way over long-on with a clean swing of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 14 off the 3 balls. This is smart batting by {{BATSMAN}}. He backs away and waits for the slower short of length delivery, ramps it over short third and the ball just manages to clear the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shot! It's the slower ball from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} picks the bones out of it. Waits for it to come to him and muscles it over mid-wicket. Second maximum of the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} put under pressure straightaway. {{BATSMAN}} does not want him to settle. This is touch wide of off-stump and he goes with the spin, nice clean bat swing to take it over long-off. Might have gone out of the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, here's the first of his dispatches. Where were you hiding {{BATSMAN}}? Gets a friendly length ball - yes. But times the leather off it with a swivelling hack. Right off the screws and right into the crowd over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stands, plants his leg out and holds his position to punch it through the line. High, mighty, and Kotla's switched sides .. {{TEAM}}, {{TEAM}}. And you thought the earlier one was the shot of the night. Poor you\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, feeds the slot. And finally, FINALLY, {{BATSMAN}} connects. He stands his ground, staying crouched, clearing his front leg and mowing this over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hammered into the stands! That's a bad ball to most players, let alone {{BATSMAN}}. Juicy full toss and he just blasts it away over deep square leg for a mammoth biggie. Clean strike\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, biggie straight down the ground and almost went into the press box. {{BATSMAN}} puts on the dancing shoes, comes down the track and strikes it sweetly with the full bat face right back over {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this one's got the height.. and the distance! Enormous! {{BATSMAN}} gets to the pitch of the ball and smokes it over long-on for a massive six. Was in the air for an eternity\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dug in short at pace, good height too, but it's flown into the crowd. {{BATSMAN}} has swivelled across quickly and helped the pull over backward square. This is sensational batting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a biggie! Not a good ball, drifts one on the pads does {{BOWLER}}. {{BATSMAN}} gets forward to take his front leg out of the equation and hoists it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, some more. {{BOWLER}} loses his line, ends up too straight and finds it swatted. Hard, flat, cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, mammoth! {{BOWLER}} is brave enough to toss it up to {{BATSMAN}}, who plonks his front foot forward and muscles the loft over the bowler's head. Cleared the sightscreen with ease. All bottom hand!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lays into it again, and it's six more. This is some lovely batting from the {{TEAM}} captain. He didn't overhit the ball this time, just an extension of the off-drive, and it sails over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this time {{BOWLER}} does not get away with a full toss. There's the big hit {{BATSMAN}} was looking for, heaves it towards cow corner and has made a decent connection for the ball to carry over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh, he's miscued this but guess what? It's sailed all the way for a maximum. Plenty of flight from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} sits low and goes across the line with the spin on the swipe. Gets enough bat on it to send it into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, only one hand on that. Full length {{BATSMAN}}livery outsi{{BATSMAN}} off, {{BATSMAN}} goes for it with full swing and manages to clear covers\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the intentions are clear from {{BATSMAN}}. Wasting no time whatsoever in putting these filths to the fence. Another dragged down delivery, on leg. {{BATSMAN}} bends low to get in line with the ball and hacks it behind square for a maximum. 10 off first two, pressure on the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bowls it short first ball and {{BATSMAN}} is quick to pump him over long-on. Swiftly jumps onto the back foot and thumps a flat pull over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a gigantic hit. For a moment, I thought it might go on and land onto the Pune-Mumbai Expressway. Fullish length, {{BATSMAN}} moves to his right and wallops it over long-on. That went miles in the air and cleared the fence by a long way as well. High and handsome\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slightly slower and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} plays his favorite slog to leg, connects cleanly and it goes all the way over mid-wicket. Can't give him the room to swing his arms\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just look at that shot! Unbelieveable, reckons Sunny G on air. Was a touch short around off, {{BATSMAN}} treks back and lifts it over covers for a lovely six. Class!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, incredible batting from the Royals. They're bossing this so far. Lavish off-drive from {{BATSMAN}}, and his flourish has taken it all the way over wide long-off. {{BOWLER}} disappears for 15 in his first over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's got hold of that. You bet he has. {{BOWLER}} skids it through from a length on middle, {{BATSMAN}} takes a shimmy down and launches it over {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, six more with the sweep. Went a touch harder there, but once again the length is perfect for the shot. It goes further. Goes over the roof\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh boyyyyy! Has Negi dropped the match here? What a big miss from him at deep extra cover. After taking so many catches, he lets one burst through his hands. Flighted just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} mistimes it as it comes off the toe-end. Skies in the air near the fence, Negi was in good position but it slips through and sails over the rope. You can't give a lifeline to someone like {{BATSMAN}}, he will make you pay..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, rank sitter. {{BATSMAN}} holds his pose, holds his shape and decides to time it out of here - rocking behind and playing it with the straightest of bats as he punches it straight down, flush\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and again.. {{BOWLER}} persists with the short of length {{BATSMAN}}livery, this time {{BATSMAN}} {{BATSMAN}}ci{{BATSMAN}}s to put him in the crowd, quick swivel on the back foot and the pull is sent over {{BATSMAN}}ep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 26 needed off the last over now. I'm not calling this, yet. Another slower delivery on the shorter side, {{BATSMAN}} ducks but only to get under it and hoicks it up and over backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just about clears the man at long-on. An almost tossed up ball. {{BATSMAN}} goes with the swing and muscles it over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stunning strike from Krishnappa {{BATSMAN}}, that too off his very first ball. The crowds jump out of their seats as he muscles his flat-batted heave over long-off. It's gone soaring into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brings up the 50-run stand in style. Helped by a mediocre delivery of course. You don't bowl length to this guy. {{BATSMAN}} waits on the back foot and biffs it high and over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has no other option but to go for it. Even though he is losing partners in a heap at the other end. Quicker and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lofts it handsomely over extra cover and clears the rope comfortably. The most difficult shot to play against an offie and he's made it look ridiculously easy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hat-trick of sixes! {{BOWLER}} bowls this wider outside off, {{BATSMAN}} goes deep in the crease and also moved towards off to hoist it over long-on. He lofted it off the back foot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh no Jonny show some mercy on the 16-year-old. He dashes down the ground, takes it on the full and clobbers it over deep mid-wicket with utmost ease for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just over the outstreched hand of Ankit Rajpoot at long leg. Just! {{BATSMAN}} went for the pull, didn't get all of it, dragged it off the bottom half and it eluded the fieldsman near the boundary ropes. Rajpoot kept his head still and flung himself backwards, but it fell tantalizingly past his fingertips\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} brings up the 50-run stand with a maximum. Gets a low full and the southpaw makes sure to thump it over the long-on fence for a powerful six. The ball's lost in the crowd as the fourth umpire runs in with a box of used Kookaburras\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he won Delhi the last game by cracking back to back fours. Steps down this time and lofts with a straight bat to clear the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there's the first six of the game. Didn't take long. You cannot bowl short to {{BATSMAN}} not on this ground, not on any ground, easy pickings as he nonchalantly pulls it over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, OLLLLAALLLAAAA! That was some response from {{BATSMAN}} to a short ball. He loved the aroma on the perfume ball and accepted it with glee. That drop might well be costly\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, charges out of his crease, gets closer to the pitch of the delivery and clubs it many-a-mile over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely tossed up on off, {{BATSMAN}} gets a big stride forward and then lifts it nonchalantly over long-off, went a long way into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, tonks off the front foot now. Gets under the good length and lofts it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fittingly {{BATSMAN}} finishes the innings with a six. What a cameo this was from him. {{BOWLER}} bowls it short and {{BATSMAN}} easily muscles the pull over deep mid-wicket. The man in the deep is just a spectator. Well that has been the story for the last few overs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, takes {{BOWLER}} on and whacks this length ball straight back down. Flat-batted slap that skims over the boundary ropes in front of the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that shot was all about timing! Minimum effort and maximum result. {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the wicket and lofts the flighted delivery against the spin. The timing was such that it just about manages to clear Warner at long-off, beautiful\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}, gee he is some talent! Shimmies down, gets to the pitch of the ball and sends the cherry soaring straight over the sightscreen. Thwackkk\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, flush in the slot, and {{BATSMAN}}'s V is always smoke-worthy. He gets his front leg out of the way, makes room and slogs it high and long into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, dropped short, absolutely abominable delivery, {{BATSMAN}} rocks back and deposits it over deep mid-wicket with a pull for six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes! Almost an action replay off the previous ball. {{BATSMAN}} was clearing his front leg, {{BOWLER}} bowls another slower {{BATSMAN}}livery and AB smokes it over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} isn't learning at all. Third slower {{BATSMAN}}livery, this was the knuckle {{BATSMAN}}livery, he is overdoing it, {{BATSMAN}} may have seen what he is doing, even if he hasn't, can pick it from the hand, the slower {{BATSMAN}}livery lands outsi{{BATSMAN}} off and with a swing of the bat, the ball is seen flying over wi{{BATSMAN}} long-off. What can this man not do on a cricket field? Absolutely nothing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smashed for six. Was a length ball and he picked his spot, rocked back and sent it into the crowd at deep mid-wicket. {{BOWLER}} is welcome with a biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, there you go. Picks it off his pads and just hoicks it away with disdain. Waits in the crease and swings his bat at the right time, poppin' the ball over deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, advances and lofts the ball, the timing is good enough and the ball clears the long-on fence quite comfortably. It was the googly from {{BOWLER}} but {{BATSMAN}} read it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has finished off the things in style. {{TEAM}} win by 6-wickets and go top of the table. Incredible hitting from the southpaw. Hold On! Umpires are still checking whether that ball hit the rope on the full. It's a six and Delhi has sealed the victory!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a shot to reach his fifty! Shortish delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't miss out on the opportunity and swings it over mid-wicket. Flat and over the ropes, she goes!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's nailed over deep mid-wicket. Shimmies down the wicket and pulls the short ball over the fence for half a dozen, way back into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, two fours followed by a six, {{BATSMAN}}sanity is back ladies and gentlemen. Nothing but a back of a length delivery and the golf like swing comes to the fore, slapped over the wide long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 20-ball fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Rabada congratulates and his mates in the dressing room are delighted. {{BATSMAN}} raises his bat and soaks in all the applause. {{BOWLER}} struggles again, keeps missing his length and gets punished once again. {{BATSMAN}} takes it on the full and dispatches it into the deep mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, never bowl short to {{BATSMAN}}, {{BOWLER}} learns why. Bends his back and goes short, {{BATSMAN}} quickly shifts his weight back and pulls, not too convincing but enough timing on it to send it into the deep mid-wicket stands. Imperious from {{TEAM}} captain\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hit-me delivery and {{BATSMAN}} obliges. A gift on the pads and {{BATSMAN}} picks it up nonchalantly over backward square, struck it flat and got it over the rope. Bhuvi also might have misjudged as he came in before running back, too late by then\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}}'s found his range tonight. Clears the front leg to a length ball and clubs it down the ground. Clean hitting\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} nails this. He should have tried this shot on the previous ball. Once again gets his front leg out of the way to give him a free swing, {{BOWLER}} makes his job easier by bowling a length delivery, tonked straight back over {{BOWLER}} for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, two sixes in three balls. The required rate is back under 12. Handsome strike from {{BATSMAN}}, crunching the full ball over long-on to bring up his half-century\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smacked away! Takes full toll of the extra delivery, does {{BATSMAN}}. Full and in the slot for him, he just hacks it over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. DD needed that badly, they certainly did\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, huge and that's into the top tier of the ground, too full and too wide from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} gets underneath the ball and sends it soaring - high and over cover for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Mr. 360 is back with a bang! Short {{BATSMAN}}livery, it was a {{BATSMAN}}ad meat of a {{BATSMAN}}livery for the batsman who was on the back foot, he picked the bones out of that. Pivots on the back foot and then hammers the pull on the on-si{{BATSMAN}} for a maximum and with that his fifty.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, my word, how well has he timed that! {{BOWLER}} appeared to have deceived {{BATSMAN}} with a cutter and {{BATSMAN}} had to really reach out for it. But his wristwork is a work of genius. He somehow manages to whip the ball away over the deep square leg boundary. Fantastic shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short ball at the off-stump, {{BATSMAN}} has a free swing across the line between mid-wicket and long-on and gets it over the fielder for six! Terrific shot, and they'll need a lot more of those!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, helicoptered straight down the ground! Mini-helicopter you can call. Tossed up on middle, {{BATSMAN}} marmalises it back over the bowler's head. Such power\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brave toss up, but it goes wrong big time. Just too full and outside off as well with {{BATSMAN}} hanging back in his crease to smoke it typically into the sightscreen straight down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's in some form in this tournament. A flighted leg-break from {{BOWLER}}, it's right in the slot. {{BATSMAN}} is close enough to the pitch, knows that {{BOWLER}} doesn't turn it a great deal and just swings through the line over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and this should seal it from {{BATSMAN}}. He gets low, bends across, moves late to the off-si{{BATSMAN}} and sweeps this low full toss into the crowd backward of square. Classic {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, right in the swinging arc for {{BATSMAN}}, wide and full outside off, {{BATSMAN}} steps forward and lofts it flat over long-off for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, even mishits can fly on this ground - {{BOWLER}} misses his yorker, offers a full-toss on the pads, {{BATSMAN}} didn't get hold of the shovel, but the short boundaries takes care as the ball sails over the ropes. 100th six in Sharjah this IPL\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clubbed away! Such power from {{BATSMAN}}, he's made it look so easy but trust me, it wasn't. Fullish ball from {{BOWLER}} and he errs to land it in {{BATSMAN}}'s arc, merrily swung away over wide long-on with all the nonchalance in the world. Went deep into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, two in two! Overpitched delivery by {{BOWLER}} and it has been pumped over long-on by {{BATSMAN}} once again. The young spinner put under pressure by Nicky P\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} gets underneath this flighted delivery and sweeps it straight into the ad-cushions behind square on the leg-side. {{BOWLER}} looped it on leg-stump and {{BATSMAN}} went low in time to connect it beautifully to smash it for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's a start to the over, and the pressure is right back on the bowler now! Full and wide, and he gets on his knee to slice this over deep backward point for six! Fifty for {{BATSMAN}}, and this may well be a coming-of-age story in Dubai tonight, as he raises his bat...\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it's in the orbit. It's into the car park. And {{BATSMAN}} turns hero - coming right at the climax, scoring at a strike rate of 300. Gets a juicy back of a length ball, in the slot and flat-bats it across the line. Into the clouds. And then cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, yeah, that's what I was talking about! So pleasing to the eyes. Short ball around middle and leg, \"{{BATSMAN}} has more than a second to spot the length,\" as Kohli says. Doesn't even need to transfer his weight as he pulls it over deep square leg. 86 metres!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is in some form - he will have to take over the role of the aggressor now, full and just outside off, he bends down low and pumps the slog-sweep over mid-wicket for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, helps it away for a biggie! {{BOWLER}} spoils the over with a short ball around leg stump, doesn't rise enough to threaten {{BATSMAN}} who swivels to just control the pull. The emphasis was to just use the pace and get it over short fine leg. In the end, it went all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} wants to make an impact. Takes on long-on and goes over his head. Uses his feet and then a clean swing of the bat. Rest you know. Sails into the stands. So effortless\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's hit that in the airrr, not timed that well, there is a man at {{BATSMAN}}ep backward square leg, he jumps and it's eva{{BATSMAN}}d him. The length was just a bit too full, {{BATSMAN}} got insi{{BATSMAN}} the line of this flighted {{BATSMAN}}livery and slog-swept it over backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} gives it little more air this time. {{BATSMAN}} jumps out of his crease quickly and thumbs it over long-on for a maximum. First one of the innings\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Jadeja can only get a hand on it and he parries it over the ropes. Would be very harsh to call it a drop. {{BATSMAN}} danced down the track and slug in the direction of the turn. Just over RJ at long-on, who timed his jump to perfection and went for a one-handed catch\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, clean as a whistle! Can {{BATSMAN}} do a Russell? Keeps his eyes on the ball and smokes the tossed up delivery right over the bowler's head. High, handsome and it's six runs for Mumbai Indians. Yuvi needs to hit a few of these if the hosts want to make a match out of it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, picks the slower delivery and deposits the pull over the deep backward square leg fielder. Not that short, but with a half-swivel {{BATSMAN}} pulled that meatily and got himself a biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, G-I-G-A-N-T-I-C! Made a cracking sound off the blade and {{BATSMAN}} has sent this into the top tier at long-on. There was plenty of flight and he absolutely clouted this\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, too short from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across and then helps it on its way, high and over long leg for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, comes down the track and lofts the ball over long-on. That is a much needed tonic to this innings which was starting to go nowhere. A slight movement down the ground and then the smacking hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smoked over cow corner. Flighted delivery from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} goes back very quickly on seeing the length and powers it into the stands. Dismissive stuff!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he has clubbed this for six! What a start to the over. Low full toss wide of off from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across a bit, bends his back knee and frees his arms. Muscles it over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that shall give him some confidence. Or rather, a lot of it. He's a confidence player. Picks the bones out of this slower delivery and smokes it over deep mid-wicket for half-a-dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the murder continues. Mass murder. Another spirit buries itself inside this pitch. Overcompensates going short, going quick but the response is quicker. Is brutal too. Back to his high backlifted pulls. Gravity too cannot pull it down\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short one at the body, {{BATSMAN}} shapes up to hook - oops, he's late on it - bit of a top-edge, very high on the bat, goes over the expectant fine leg fiel{{BATSMAN}}r for six! QdK is surprised it carried!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely shot! Picks the length early on the short one, backs away and nonchalantly lofts it over long-off. Has enough on it to evade the man in the deep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, down the pitch and bang! The {{TEAM}} skipper has decided to up the ante a little. Shimmies down the track on seeing the flight and the leg-stump line helped as well, launched into the stands at deep mid-wicket. Super shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, even the Purple Cap holder hasn't been spared. Stands tall and towers the length ball over long-on to welcome {{BOWLER}} into the attack\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is {{BATSMAN}} at his very best. He has taken {{BOWLER}} apart. Stays put in the crease and slams the pull shot over deep mid-wicket. Lot of wrist work in that shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, here's the start. On the pedal. A wrong radar stuff this..down leg. Compounds the misery further with he front leg planted inside the line and then it is business as usual. The flattest of airy-sweeps you'd ever come across\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, length from {{BOWLER}} and it disappears way back over mid-wicket. The {{TEAM}} dugout is on its feet. What a blow from {{BATSMAN}}. But this is ordinary death bowling. Seam-up and good length, right there in the slot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! Brilliantly played. It was short and wide outside off, {{BATSMAN}} waits for it and slashes it. Didn't bother to keep it down and up she goes. Over backward point and the ball sails over the boundary rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, finally, a 100-run partnership between {{BATSMAN}} and AB this season. {{BOWLER}} bowls a good length delivery down the leg-side in trying to follow {{BATSMAN}}, but the Indian captain is so good with his wrists and whips it away over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh my, he's brought out the reverse-sweep and it's gone for six. Completely switched his legs around, got blessed with a full toss and walloped it over backward point\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hit-myer! {{BOWLER}} goes short, but this one isn't going to trouble the batsman. {{BATSMAN}} is quick to rock back as he pulls it over deep backward square leg for six runs\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that is the flattest hit for six. Rocks back and muscles the pull, over mid-wicket, picked the shortish delivery and was onto it in a flash. Sailed into the crowd\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he just stands there and admires the shot. Darted into the slot, {{BATSMAN}} with a cleared front leg helps himself to another maximum, smacks with minimum backlift over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, proper pasting for {{BOWLER}} in this over. 19 runs off it and just the momentum {{TEAM}} were looking for. Went short, no real threat behind it. {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, taking his eyes off the ball and pulls it over short fine leg. Sweet timing and it flies all the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hat-trick of sixes. {{BOWLER}} is being taken to the cleaners by his mate. A repeat of the previous two shots, {{BOWLER}} needs to change things up, he ends up bowling in {{BATSMAN}}'s half and the big hit clears long-off with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! This is brutal! Dances down the track and goes big with the swing. Sends well over the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the carnage continues! Pitched up by {{BOWLER}}, and although it was wide - {{BATSMAN}} manages to reach for it as he tonks it right over the bowler's head, and into the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smoked it! Tossed up delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} has smacked this one over the mid-wicket fence for half a dozen to reach his fifty.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, well tossed up delivery and the batsman slog sweeps it out of the park. That brings fifty for {{BATSMAN}}! This has been a fine knock from the keeper-batsman. This might as well break the shackles\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh dear! That's released all the pressure. He'd beaten {{BATSMAN}} twice and then follows it up with a filthy delivery in the form of trying a variation. He suggests that he wanted to bowl the carrom ball, but it slipped down the leg-side and {{BATSMAN}} helped himself to a six with a pull over backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fine blow. Two big hits from {{BATSMAN}} in this over and both have come when it has been tossed up and in the teeing off range. This time {{BATSMAN}} goes straight back over the bowler's head. Good over for {{TEAM}} - 15 off it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, maiden fifty for {{BATSMAN}}. Raina stands and applauds. Picks the wrong-un and pulls, it was catchable for Nabi at the deep mid-wicket fence, but he was mindful of the ropes behind him, goes reverse-cup and can't catch it. Can't push it back either. {{BOWLER}} doesn't like that effort from his countryman\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, six more! Not so convincing this but {{BATSMAN}} won't mind. This was a short of length delivery from {{BOWLER}}, corrected his length and slightly cramped the batsman for room. {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat hard and skews it off the outer half. Such is the power that it sails over the third man fence for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, rare bad ball from {{BOWLER}}, back of a length and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across and pulls it high and over square leg, went a long way over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, nicely tossed up at the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} leans forward and lifts it nonchalantly over long-on for a maximum. Pressure straightaway on {{BOWLER}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gets hold. And gets it into the empty deep square leg, and then into the empty stands behind that. {{BOWLER}} bangs it in short, {{BATSMAN}} - now with more of a measure of this pitch - rocks behind and pulls it yummily, uppishly. Also, there's nobody in those stands to give the ball back as well. So, get the fourth ump working ..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh what a shot! {{BOWLER}} will be kicking himself for bowling a freebie full ball on the leg stump, Mo flicks with a strong bottom hand grip and it sails over backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautifully played, what made the shot even more special was that he didn't get to the pitch of the ball. It only allowed him to free his arms and lift it inside out over cover, went sailing all the way\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, excellent shot to get off the mark. He's in sublime touch, has carried his form into this match too. On a length outside off, stands tall and pumps that over covers for half a dozen. Flat and over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, in the airrrr and dropped. {{BOWLER}} is furious. Stanlake is the culprit. Don't even look at the bowler. A short ball down leg, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across and pulls, hits it straight to fine leg. Stanlake prances to his right, goes reverse-cupped but makes a royal mess of it. The ball bursts through his fingers and what's worse is, it carries over the fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is off the mark with a six. I'm not surprised. Swings his bat hard and takes on the man at long-on. The fielder is made to look like a spectator. It was a length ball, {{BATSMAN}} stood tall and thumped it well over the fielder. Hello Chennai\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, over the wicket, odd angle for Shaks, {{BATSMAN}} gets low and plays a hybrid sweepull over backward square leg for six. Fifty up for Watto! Big match, and the big man stands up!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely mini-helicopter from {{BATSMAN}}! It's a shot that he's developed in recent times and not only is it great to watch but also is extremely effective. {{BOWLER}} didn't really miss his yorker by much here, was quite full in length but HP is sitting very deep, waiting for any slipup in length. Then just propels it with that flourish of his to send it deep into the stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, ends {{BOWLER}}'s spell with a maximum. Fraction short and {{BATSMAN}} was quick to pick the length, he crouched a bit to get underneath the pull shot and sent it over a jumping Shorey at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh yes. That's off the middle alright. {{BOWLER}} tries the sucker full ball to follow. And {{BATSMAN}} tonks it straight down, full flow, full elegance, full pose. And to imagine he's 17\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, connects and connects well. This time gets on top of the bounce of this length {{BATSMAN}}livery, takes on the short ball and hacks it with ferocity into the {{BATSMAN}}ep square leg stands. This should get him going\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's in the stands! {{BATSMAN}} is showing no mercy on his State mate. Fractionally short from {{BOWLER}} and that's all that was needed for the in-form {{BATSMAN}}. Swivels to pull this away for a biggie. Didn't get a full chunk of it, didn't have to in the end as it cleared the deep mid-wicket fence with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now the full flowing bat down the ground to loft {{BOWLER}} into the sightscreen. {{BATSMAN}}, what a talent. Length delivery, in the slot, but {{BATSMAN}} made it look so easy. Rohit not happy with the length or the idea from the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's smoking them in. With a gallop down, gets the ball sitting up in his arc and keeps swinging his bat. We are firmly into the baseball zone. Over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, good end to the over. A massive end actually. In the arc of the southpaw and the batsman comes up with an explosive response to tonk the ball over the cow corner region\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's one helluva shot! From round the wicket, {{BOWLER}} doles out a leg-stump half-volley, {{BATSMAN}} goes slightly leg-side and clouts it over deep mid-wicket. Way into the stands. Absolutely pummeled\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking sound. Full and in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} muscles that way back over the long-on fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it had to be short. It HAD to be given the last ball's treatment, but {{BATSMAN}}'s smarter, rocking behind, going with a straight punch, extending his followthough into the sightscreen down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, second six for {{BATSMAN}} and {{TEAM}} are off to a flier. Waits for this slingy ball to come to him and dispatches it into the long-on stands. 15 runs off the over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} gives a lot of air on this off-break, but the length is slightly too full. {{BATSMAN}} gets down on a knee and bludgeons it over long-on for half a dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, two dot balls and {{BATSMAN}} has had enough. Runs at the bowler and nonchalantly lofts it over wide long-off, easily clears the rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just clears the man in the deep. Flatter around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} goes down on his knee and slog sweeps it over square leg. Ngidi is the man in the deep who tries hard to grab it in left hand but it's way above him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's massive! {{BATSMAN}} has absolutely clouted this. Shuffles across the stumps a bit and this is flat from {{BOWLER}}, full as well and disappears over deep mid-wicket. Huge hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this has gone some 10 rows back. Such is his power. Full and just outside off, {{BATSMAN}} stands motionless and wallops it over long-on. Not off the middle but still soars over the ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, goodness gracious. Spots the bowler rolling his fingers across and delays his slog over mid-wicket, bruting the ball way over for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has dispatched it over for a maximum .Whatta hit from {{BATSMAN}}! This has surely sealed the match for {{TEAM}}. It was on a fuller length and was wide of off, {{BATSMAN}} comes under it and pumps it over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and the sweep gets him out of jail. Emphatically. Knelt down and smacked it. The bat made a massive noise as it met the ball. The ball whistled over deep mid\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely hit, down the pitch, lofted with the spin and way back over long-on, the leggie again, picked that from the hand and smashed it, highest IPL score for {{BATSMAN}}\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another shuffle, and {{BOWLER}} fires it in quicker and into the body. {{BATSMAN}} pulls, no, wait, tonks, over an empty backward square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's huge! Akila concedes his first six of IPL and that's only his second delivery. Nothing much he could have done about it. Flighted one around middle and leg, {{BATSMAN}} shimmies down the wicket and smokes it for a 95 metre six over mid-wicket. Welcome to the IPL, chirps Nasser Hussain on air\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, flat hit! That was a flatter delivery and the batsman spanks it down the ground and over the bowler's head to give himself a wonderful fifty! This has been a top-class knock from the Trinidadian\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, too short and the angle worked against {{BOWLER}} here, {{BATSMAN}} swivels across, doesn't bother to keep the ball down and sends it soaring into the second tier - way over backward square leg for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is why he's been picked in the IPL. Shows no sign of nerves and pumps the full ball over long-off, {{BOWLER}} didn't have the pace to trouble the batsman and it was righ in the slot for a left-hander\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this one is a sequel to the previous six. Meatier and bigger. He knelt down and clobbered the slog sweep deep into the stands. That should be six and a half, Danny would agree for sure\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full pace at a back of a length - never mind how slow Kotla is when {{BOWLER}}'s dishing out juicy freebies. {{BATSMAN}} lays into in style, walking across his stumps, making it into a leg-line and then swivelling as well to ensure he makes full use of fine leg being inside the ring with the airy mow\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's muscled that over the long-on boundary. Nothing but brute power. It's a decent ball from {{BOWLER}}: a leg-cutter wide of off. But {{BATSMAN}} swings his hips, pumps his arms and flat-bats it away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and he piles it on with a salt rub. Gets a ball in the slot at a good length and just swings his bat out. Tonking it down the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, hacked away! {{BATSMAN}} is in the mood! {{BOWLER}} fired this in and the Kiwi sat down to half-pull this over deep square leg. Absolutely clobbered it!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slower delivery, {{BATSMAN}} picks that up and dismantles the ball over the cow corner region for a maximum. That is it. {{TEAM}} have got themselves out of jail here after self-imprisoning themselves with a dreadful start. They were 7 for 4 but Pollard-{{BATSMAN}} have done it for them. 3rd win for {{TEAM}}!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, Gee! Quick hands from {{BATSMAN}}, he picks up the length early, reaches the pitch of the ball and deposits in the stands at deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whacked over cow corner. {{BATSMAN}} tees off, gets under a flighted delivery and pumps it just over the ropes for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, stand and deliver! Length delivery around off and {{BATSMAN}} stays put and lofts it straight over the bowler's head. Straight as an arrow and that shall be a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, superb shot! Much-needed for {{TEAM}}. Probably the first one that {{BOWLER}} floated ever so slightly and {{BATSMAN}} was down the pitch in a flash. Lofted through the line and send it soaring down the ground. Clears the ropes with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, right in the slot. And {{BATSMAN}} goes into the beast mo{{BOWLER}}. Swings, hard and mighty. Muscles it over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, another flat maximum! {{BATSMAN}} has started to find his range and {{TEAM}} are clawing their way back into the game through him. In the slot again from {{BOWLER}} and it's been powered down the ground with loads of power. Long-on tried to get across but it was comfortably over the fielder's head\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 145.1km/h, too short and too wide, {{BATSMAN}} has no interest in it until the ball is almost parallel to him, no unnecessary movement, just gets under it and upper-cuts it over third man for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, looked a bit fidgety last over, but boy he has nailed this out of the screws. Underneath a flat delivery and he goes spank over mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, gets his maiden IPL fifty in style with a maximum. He becomes the youngest cricketer in the IPL to score a fifty! Gee! This young man has some power. And he has flaunted that on this delivery. It was in the slot on a fuller length, he swings his willow, gets it off the sweet spot and it went a long way back into the stands. And boy, isn't he pumped!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a stunning hit over long-on. {{BATSMAN}} is playing an absolute blinder here to spring the game back to life. A flighted leg-break on off, {{BATSMAN}} doesn't bother using his feet. Just a stride forward to smash it through the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back of a length slower ball, {{BATSMAN}} picks it off the hand, he waited and waited for the ball to arrive, gets himself in a decent position and tonks it over deep mid-wicket for a six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, well looped up delivery and has been smacked down the ground. Only a shot away now are the Capitals from investing in a win. Poor delivery again from {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} was in no mood to let that go away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is turning the heat on. Not off the middle, but {{BATSMAN}} won't mind as he got enough wood on his hook against this short ball that sails over the long leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's just a blatant display of biceps. Comes on the front foot and scythes this length ball over cow corner. Trust me when I say this: it was hammered away disdainfully with a torso torque\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, woah! One of biggest of the night. Gets to the pitch of the ball and clubs it over wide long-on for six more. Carnage!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, cracking shot, he's in some devastating form at the moment - {{BATSMAN}}. Length delivery from {{BOWLER}}, that's a cardinal sin for any bowler. {{BATSMAN}} gets his left leg out of the way and drills it back over the bowler's head, went high and into the top tier of the Chinnaswamy\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} is welcomed with a straight six by {{BATSMAN}}. Flighted delivery and {{BATSMAN}} just swings through the line, clean connection and the ball travels the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's done it several times for Kerala - he's showing why {{TEAM}} picked him up as KL's replacement. Runs down the track, gets close to the ball and lifts it over long-on for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is innovation at its very best! Moved across his off-stump and uses {{BOWLER}}' pace to lap the full ball high and over the fine leg fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, bang in the slot. And here's {{BATSMAN}}'s lazy elegance. On a knee, swinging, sorry slogging, and depositing it deep into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, and he's got the distance. It was in the air for a long time but he had made enough connection to beat deep mid-wicket. Slower short of length delivery and it sat up nicely, {{BATSMAN}} shuffles across and heaves it with a clean bat swing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, 26 off the final over! Just the momentum push DD were seeking and they've finished with a flourish here. {{BOWLER}} loses the plot completely to dish out a juicy full toss, {{BATSMAN}} in this hitting mood isn't going to miss out. Goes straight once again with the loft and once more, crashes into the sightscreen for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, sure that time-out has helped KW. Settling into his groove now. Gets into position early and dispatches a short ball flat into the backward square stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whoa. This is getting back in the 2007 zone. {{BOWLER}} without a clue as to where to bowl goes full and wide. The mind-reader gets the front leg out and unleashes a full bat swing showing the maker's name in tonking it right on the extra cover ropes\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} spoils {{BOWLER}}'s over. Just short of a yorker and {{BATSMAN}} clears his front foot to thump it straight over the bowler's head for his third maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a step forward and then thump over long-on. All bottom hand in that. Trademark {{BATSMAN}}. Saw the flight on that leggie and then thumped it with lots of wrist and the bottom hand took over. Long-on was just a spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely, tad too full from {{BOWLER}}, {{BATSMAN}} gets a good stride forward, drives it through the line and clears the ropes at long-on with ease. The key was he didn't look to muscle the shot, nor did he play across the line\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now carves this slower ball inside-out for six. Wow. Clean strike from {{BATSMAN}} who picked the variation early and smoked it into the crowd. Brings the crowd to life\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he has whacked this carrom ball over deep square leg's head. Not long boundaries here, so even a decent contact comfortably takes it over the ropes. Walked across the stumps, sat down low and got a great length for the slog-sweep\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, full and wide, {{BATSMAN}} has a proper dash at it and he's flayed it away over the point boundary. Magnificent hit. {{BOWLER}} won't enjoy that\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, a clear case of a missed yorker. Ends up becoming a juicy full toss and {{BATSMAN}} stands and swishes across the line. Several rows into his favoured mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, make it four in a row! 25 off {{BOWLER}}'s over. The previous ball - he came down. Now, he stays deep in the crease. The ball is in his arc and he uses his wrists to whip it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, whoa. The beast mode is out. And the ball has been tonked into one of the metros going around. {{BATSMAN}} is back to his earlier avatar of galloping down to spinners and just swings the bat keeping it as straight as possible. Laced over long-on. Has to be the biggest of this season\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, back-to-back sixes. Quicker delivery, too straight as well, that's been bludgeoned over deep mid-wicket with a mighty swing of the bat\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, slower ball at 124.2kph, it was wi{{BATSMAN}}r outsi{{BATSMAN}} off and {{BATSMAN}} had to reach out for it. Slightly bends his back leg and lofts it over long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, big jump down the pitch, and a bigger bat swing. It really looked a miscued slice at first, but there's enough bottom handed power, and Chinnaswamy isn't the biggest to get it to sail over the sightscreen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's hugeeeeeeeeeeeee! {{BATSMAN}} continues on his merry ways. Picks the top spinner quickly and brings out the imperious slog sweep. Huge maximum over deep backward square leg. Brings up his 50! He is looking deadly tonight\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's hit that straight into the stage where a display car is kept. He sat on that slower ball. It was a touch on the shorter si{{BATSMAN}}, AB is quick to rock back before mowing it over wi{{BATSMAN}} long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, advances to a slower ball and slaps it over mid-off, and over the boundary too. He had stepped towards the leg-side, and found himself reaching for the ball that was outside off. But that didn't seem to hamper the timing\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the helicopter has arrived in Kolkata. Goes deep in his crease and flicks it with a lot of power. He's started playing this shot even better than the man who invented it. Towering six over the deep mid-wicket fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, so, it was just a sighter from {{BATSMAN}}. Spots one in the zone, gets low and imbues his forearm strength to clout this into the deep mid-wicket stands\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, okay, you have to learn! Got away with one previous ball bowling full, this time the line is outsi{{BATSMAN}} off and allows {{BATSMAN}} to swing his arms. Easily lofted over long-off and AB is pretty good with his timing, isn't he?\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wowza! For a moment, it looked like {{BATSMAN}} had mistimed this but nope, got enough timing on it to clear Shardul at long-off. {{BOWLER}} has his hands on his head. Slowish and serves it outside off, {{BATSMAN}} throws his bat and didn't connect it off the middle. Came off the toe-end but such is his power that it sails a leaping Shardul for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, muscled. Dragged down by {{BOWLER}} and {{BATSMAN}} decides to go over long-on. Pure power from the Kiwi. Biffed that off the back foot and watched the ball go over long-on. 14 to him off {{BOWLER}} in that over and he gets a move on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} skips down and chips over the wide long-on fence. It is all over! Pune are through, winning by 9 wickets. {{BATSMAN}} gets some runs, finally\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} has a piece of the leggie. 28 runs off the over. {{BOWLER}} went fast and short outside off, {{BATSMAN}} does not commit to the shot, waits for it and then smacks it over extra cover.\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, thumped over long-off. Not quite to the pitch of it, and he's against the spin, but there's enough in those arms to tonk over\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, strays on to the pads and clipped away over fine leg. Fifth six for {{BATSMAN}}. This ball is flying off the bat. Bad bowling this from {{BOWLER}}, who has gone for tons of runs already\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a stunning way to get to your maiden T20 century! {{BOWLER}} bowls it quick, full and on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} moves slightly to his right and lofts it down the ground. MUSCLED\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, beautifully played, he pre-empted that {{BOWLER}} was flighting this one, backed away, gets underneath the length and lifts it back over the bowler, clears the sightscreen and it's {{BATSMAN}}'s first maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is picking the spinner well today. Comes down the track in a flash and gets to the pitch of the ball to nail this over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} has conceded 65 runs already! {{BATSMAN}} gets underneath the full ball and smokes it right into the sightscreen. He's turning it on here, brilliant striking and the decibels have gone a notch higher in Hyderabad. Crowd is loving it\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, shot! {{BOWLER}} provided a bit of width outside off on this short of length delivery and {{BATSMAN}} used his quick hands to great effect. Carved it over backward point and the ball has enough wings to go the distance\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, oh my! That's disappeared into the top tier. {{BOWLER}} is just too predictable with his slower deliveries, it is all back of a length stuff, {{BATSMAN}} waits and swings his bat at the right time, pumps it flat and all the way over deep mid-wicket\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, for a moment Rayudu at fine leg thought he had a chance as he raced to his left but this cleared the square leg fence. Fuller ball on middle and off, {{BATSMAN}} just went across to play the pick up shot. Quick hands and supple wrists on the drop kick from {{BATSMAN}} as this whistled away\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brilliant. {{BOWLER}} floats it up full, {{BATSMAN}} is ready for it. Unleashes his muscles and dumps it over the bowler's head for a maximum. Raina walks up immediately and consoles the bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, magnificent shot, pacy length ball on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} makes room by backing away, swings hard and sends it sailing over extra-cover for a maximum, flat and hard - that's what made {{TEAM}} shell big bucks to buy him in the auctions\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this should ease {{BATSMAN}}'s nerves. Much-needed hit for DD. {{BOWLER}} overdoes it; full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} lines up and smacks it with ferocity over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it was a matter of time before Mo took on one of these two. He brings out the dancing shoes, gets close to the flighted delivery and smokes it with the spin over the cow corner fence\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's outta here. Third time the ball has been smashed out of the stadium today. {{BATSMAN}} once again picks what {{BOWLER}} is bowling, runs down the wicket and gets close to the ball, lofts it handsomely over long-on and out of the ground\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, it takes two balls for {{BATSMAN}} to wrap it up! This one's right in the slot from {{BOWLER}} to which {{BATSMAN}} clears the front leg and wallops it over long-off. Sensational win for the Rajasthan Royals\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, two in a row. {{BOWLER}} goes short, {{BATSMAN}} is upto it in a flash. Spindles back and pulls it behind square. Goes all the way for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that has been slapped! Short of a length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} dances down and wallops it over the bowler's head. Muscled it. Way past the boundary rope\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, crack made the sound, there! Shortish in length, {{BATSMAN}} has had enough of those. Rocks back and pulls this nicely into the night sky, high and handsome, over mid-wicket for a biggie\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, just look at the power of this man. A flighted delivery around off, {{BATSMAN}} gets hold of it and tonks it right over the bowler's head for a towering six. Massive, believe you me\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wowww! It's always interesting to see {{BATSMAN}} play aggressive cricket. This was an authoritative hit. {{BOWLER}} seemed surprise by that approach. He bowled a normal back of a length delivery, but {{BATSMAN}} had made up his mind to go big, went back in the crease and launched it over long-on for the first maximum of the day\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fabulous shot! It was the wrong 'un and {{BATSMAN}} seemed to have picked it from the hand, didn't try to go across the line, went straight and the boy packs a punch, cleared long-off with ease\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, you brutal brutal beast. Clears his front leg and destroys this back of length delivery. It's gone soaring over long-on. Phew, enough to knock the wind out of a bowler\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, \"That is what form does to you,\" says Harsha Bhogle on air. {{BOWLER}} gives plenty of air, but it lands as a freebie for {{BATSMAN}}. On the pads and he comfortably dispatches it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, heaved away for a maximum. Too predictable. Yet another slower delivery from {{BOWLER}}, it was in the arc outside off. {{BATSMAN}} picked it early, moved across towards off and swung his bat hard to smash it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, goes down on one knee and tonks the ball straight back down the ground. Finishes a good over for GL. 14 off it. {{BOWLER}} fires it full again, maybe aiming for the blockhole, but misses it by a fair distance and {{BATSMAN}} is all over him\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now {{BATSMAN}} joins the act. Wants to ive his partner a run for his money. A run for some crowd catchers. Keeps banging it in short with the pitch sucking away all the momentum. Another mow across to give the crowd some work. Brings up his fifty. In some style\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, short ball and smashed. Back-to-back sixes. Why didn't you do this when Pant was going great guns? Would have been of great help. Anyway, this is a pull shot sweetly timed over mid-wicket. Now Rayudu is livid, he wants {{BOWLER}} to nail the yorker\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} is playing a blinder here. And he still has one over to go. Can he get {{TEAM}} to 165-170? Full and outside off, {{BATSMAN}} reaches out for it, down on knee and smashing it a long way back into the deep extra cover stand. A top order batsman would have been proud of that shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, no Jas B! Unless you get that yorker right, it's difficult to control AB when you bowl into his body! This is another yorker missed, right in the slot and {{BATSMAN}}, clearing the front leg out of the way, powers it handsomely over the bowler's head for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, lovely shot, much needed blow for the Daredevils - but they need plenty of thse more. Came down the track, doesn't get too close to the ball, allows him to free his arms - plays with the turn and deposits the ball way into the stands at long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, flat six! That was just a flick of the wrists and Woakes had no chance. {{BOWLER}} missed the yorker and the low full toss was right in the arc for {{BATSMAN}}, who crouched a bit and whipped it over deep square leg\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} goes after {{BOWLER}} with deep mid-wicket and long-on in place. It was floated up outside off, {{BATSMAN}} got down, fetched it from there and slogged it over cow corner. Good contact\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he has got under this one, oh yes! {{BOWLER}} was trying to steer clear of {{BATSMAN}}'s arc but misses it for once. Full and on middle and off, the big West Indian just clears his front leg and launches it over long-on for yet another six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} is the weak link among DD's pacers and {{BATSMAN}} knows it. A free-flowing swing of the bat, nailing it off the middle and launches it into the long-on stands. Can't bowl this length {{BOWLER}}..\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, that's into the stands! {{BATSMAN}} joins the party, scores his first maximum of the night. Gets to the pitch of the ball and sends it sailing over the man at long-on for a perfectly timed six\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, brilliant. Just brilliant. {{BATSMAN}} knows that it will be on a length and slower, knows that it will be majorly outside off as well, so what does he do? Shuffles across and delectably plays a half sweep, yes a sweep, that sails into the unmanned deep square fence. Didn't look like carrying all the way, but it was a flat hit\n",
            "{{BATSMAN}} {{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, off the mark with a six. That's what he can do. Can recover momentum and up the rate so quickly. This was a full delivery on the stumps, {{BATSMAN}} connected well and sent the ball over wide long-on, he needed that for his own confidence and for the team's sake\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, even better! A normal-paced ball at 141kph from a short of length, {{BATSMAN}} picks the length early, stays in the crease and hammers it over deep mid-wicket with a powerful pull shot\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the McScoop! Ridiculous batting. Saw him do this to Tait who was bowling at the speed of light in a T20I - if I'm right at Eden Park, New Zealand - when he made a hundred. He just put off Tait that day with some unbelievable shots. This he sets up a good base, takes the full-toss from middle and ramps it over Ishan Kishan's head. All the way too\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, he's nailed it! Angles it in from round the wicket, {{BATSMAN}} gets under it, gets the bottom-hand off, and gets topspin on that flat hook over backward square leg for six!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, charges this slower one and lifts this over long-on for six! Absolutely smoked that over one of the longer boundaries here at Sharjah!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, nails the slog-sweep over cow corner! Got into position quickly and unleashed his arms across the line of this delivery\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, juicy. A full toss around the waist, full-paced as well and {{BATSMAN}} stays in the arc, in the V and slices it high, 79-meters into long-off\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, the skipper wants to make it big today. Such a lovely shot this. English length from {{BOWLER}}. Sits up nicely, on a good length and on the stumps, this is a batting belter, at least with the new ball, so the bowler's got to be clever. {{BATSMAN}} gets inside the line and just picks it up to send it over the long leg boundary\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BATSMAN}} can strike the ball. So, {{TEAM}} fans, hang in there. {{BOWLER}} switches to round the wicket and dishes out a slower delivery on a length, {{BATSMAN}} swings as hard as possible and sends it over long-on. Got plenty of height and for a second might have thought he was in trouble, but Christian was reduced to a spectator\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a shot. The googly from {{BOWLER}}, but pitches it up fuller outside off. {{BATSMAN}} isn't sparing those. Flexes his arms and murders it straight over the bowler's head for a maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, massive, {{BATSMAN}} has had enough of prodding and poking, waltzes down the track, gets close to the ball and bludgeons it over mid-wicket for a huge maximum\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this is an air-strike from MS. Even IAF would have been proud of it. He dashes down the ground in a canter, gets to the pitch of the ball and clobbers it into the night-sky. It sails into the crowd!\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, this will do! Get-out-of-jail shot from {{BATSMAN}}. {{BOWLER}} steams in and pounds it in the swinging arc, {{BATSMAN}} sets up {{BATSMAN}}ep in his crease and clobbers it over {{BATSMAN}}ep square leg for half-a-dozen\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, once again {{BOWLER}} errs on the fuller side and {{BATSMAN}} is not afraid to hit the ball in the air. Hits it very straight and ensures that long-off and long-on were not in the picture\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, wow! Six more and that's 18 off the opening over. Slightly fuller and got it to swing in a tad did {{BOWLER}}. But, that doesn't bother {{BATSMAN}}. He slightly backs away and clobbers it over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, fifty off just 18 balls -- the fastest ever by a {{TEAM}} batsman in IPL. This has been a ripper of an innings. It was a full toss and {{BATSMAN}} takes out the reverse sweeps and sends it into the crowd - behind square on the off-side. Second IPL fifty for {{BATSMAN}} this, after 77 for MI vs KXIP in Indore in 2017\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, what a shot. {{BATSMAN}} special. The lofted on-drive - his signature stroke. {{BOWLER}} once again hurls it up, tempting {{BATSMAN}} and he nonchalantly picks it with all the dexterity of the wrists over long-on\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, smoked! Back of a length delivery, {{BATSMAN}} was almost cramped for space, but got a decent connection on the short-arm pull, the ball travels to second tier at the deep mid-wicket fence. Head right on top of the ball was the key there\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, rank overcook, and Faf doesn't even have to advance out to this one - managing to stay his ground, clear out his front leg and go through the line, swinging, smoking into cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, woah! That's some shot from {{BATSMAN}}. Back of a length delivery and he was so quick to pick that, transferred his weight back and bullied it for a flat six over cow corner\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, now then, {{TEAM}} need seven more of these. But hey, this bloke has backed away to this full ball and somehow sliced this ball over backward point, normally you see the ball travel over cover, incredible hit\n",
            "{{BOWLER}} to {{BATSMAN}}, SIX, {{BOWLER}} errs by landing one in {{BATSMAN}}'s arc, it was the googly which was right in the slot, {{BATSMAN}} goes with the spin and smashes the loft over the long-on fence\n"
